There were points
that were really uncomfortable for me.

and sometimes mad.

Are you together?

175
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,027
-[woman 2] Yeah.
-Right on.

176
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,159
-How's it going?
-Good. How are you?

177
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:06,952
I'm all right.

178
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,705
Little heartbroken, but all right.

179
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,458
First off-- What's up, man?

180
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,169
-I'm Nate.
-I'm Noah.

181
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,337
-What was that?
-Noah.

182
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,880
Noah, pleasure.

183
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,465
-LaCroix?
-Sure.

184
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,050
Here you go.

185
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,888
So, how long have you two been together?

186
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,681
Seven months.

187
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,683
Seven months?

188
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,727
Wow.

189
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,783
That's incredible.

190
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,372
So, what's it take
to keep the spark alive?

191
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,460
Laughter...

192
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,630
honesty.

193
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,423
Laughter and honesty.

194
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,051
Wow.

195
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,262
[laughs]

196
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,223
All right. I'll keep that in mind.

197
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,938
I'm so sorry.
Actually, I never got your name.

198
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,940
You didn't ask me before, but it's Helen.

199
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,859
Yeah, I'm so sorry I didn't ask you.

200
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,695
[laughs and applause]

201
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,662
It's Kellen?

202
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,873
It's Helen. H-E-L-E-N.

203
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,916
-Helen?
-[Helen] Yeah, you got it.

204
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,876
Oh.

205
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,505
Probably couldn't understand
'cause it's actually pronounced "He-lain."

206
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,967
It's Gaelic.

207
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,138
But whatever. It's your name.
Say it how you want.

208
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,142
Even though you're saying it wrong.

209
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,561
I just...

210
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,065
I know 'cause my ex's name was Helen.

211
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,526
So...

212
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,531
It's crazy. [chuckles]

213
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,658
Such a rare name.

214
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,164
Where are you from?

215
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,123
Mount Vernon.

216
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,666
-Mount Vernon, New York?
-[Helen] Yes.

217
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,960
-Born and raised?
-[Helen] Yes.

218
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,670
Shut up.

219
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,590
[laughs and applause]

220
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,383
Hm...

221
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,010
Wow.

222
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,804
That's nuts. My ex, Helen...

223
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,646
she was born and raised
in Mount Vernon, New York.

224
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,523
[chuckles] That's so crazy.

225
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:44,568
Wow!

226
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,403
What's your job?

227
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,238
Hm...

228
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,036
I'm currently in between jobs.

229
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,300
That's okay. What did you do before?

230
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,428
-I worked in a gallery.
-[Nate] You worked in a gallery?

231
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,097
-Yeah.
-[Nate] Doing what?

232
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,598
I was the assistant.

233
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,643
The assistant to...?

234
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,978
[Helen] To the gallery.

235
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,690
[laughs]

236
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,776
To the gallery?

237
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,696
And what was the gallery called?

238
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,864
It was called Ghebaly.

239
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,949
Ghebaly?

240
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,284
Shut up.

241
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,704
Oh, my God!

242
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:37,955
Wow.

243
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,832
Hm...

244
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,920
That's so nuts. My ex, Helen...

245
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,507
she's currently unemployed

246
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,220
but used to be an assistant
at a gallery...

247
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,639
named Ghebaly.

248
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,727
Wow, that's so crazy.

249
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,812
Hm...

250
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,147
Okay.

251
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,484
This is kind of crazy, but...
I don't know why I'm asking this.

252
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,653
Just humor me for a sec. Okay?

253
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,199
Uber or Lyft?

254
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,453
I-- I use Lyft.

255
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,620
-Lyft?
-[Helen] Yeah.

256
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,788
Shut up.

257
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,473
My ex, Helen...

258
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,600
she's obsessed with Lyft.

259
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,441
Hence the tattoo.

260
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,154
Can you...

261
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,782
Can you go like this for me?

262
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,619
[whispers] No.

263
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,789
-What was that?
-No.

264
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,415
Helen?

265
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,432
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

266
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,145
You just dump my ass
and then show up at my solo show?

267
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,107
With some fucking guy, huh?

268
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,317
What the fuck was your name again?

269
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,360
Noah.

270
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,402
Fuckhead?

271
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,404
Oh!

272
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,367
Okay, fuckhead.

273
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,703
What do you think
about her whore ass, huh?

274
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,750
Smashing both our dicks at the same time?

275
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,545
For seven months?

276
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,385
What do you think about her whore ass?

277
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,720
I like her.

278
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,515
You like her?

279
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,352
But do you love her?

280
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,440
[laughs and applause]

281
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,111
-[Noah] Yeah.
-Yeah?

282
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,280
Why don't you get down here and prove it?

283
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,416
[cheering and applause]

284
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,424
Hey.

285
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,093
Don't make me fucking repeat myself.

286
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,849
-What does he have to do?
-What do you want me to do?

287
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,851
I'm not talking to you, bitch.

288
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,397
Hey, fuckhead, get the fuck up here.

289
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,151
Tops off.

290
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,612
-Really?
-Yeah.

291
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,536
[cheering and applause]

292
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,299
Oh.

293
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,169
How about a squeeze?

294
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,924
All right, nobody has to do
anything they don't wanna do.

295
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,054
-Do you love her?
-Yeah.

296
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,972
All right.

297
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,476
Then you're going to have to sign
this general liability release waiver.

298
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,770
[laughs and applause]

299
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,025
Read right there. Read right there.
Sign right here.

How's that feel?

Good. [indistinct]

All right. You-- You win.

321

[breathing heavily]

322
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,546
Put the mat away.

323
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,314
Is that who you want to be with?

324
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,608
Some stagehand?

325
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,280
Or you wanna be with me...

326
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,116
an alpha male?

327
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,537
No, I don't wanna be with you. Sorry.

328

[sighs]

329
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,044
It's fine, Helen.

330

All right, man.

331
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,298
Get the fuck out of here.

332
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,557
Shit.

333
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,018
I'm all stanky. [chuckles]

334
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,646
I smell like Fuckhead.

335
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,191
But Fuckhead...

336
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,277
smells like Helen.

337
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,739
Damn.

338
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,492
I miss that tuna casserole.

339
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,581
I got to wash you off.

00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,048
I'm...

513
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,136
sorry it's not really finished,
Miss Jackson, huh...

514
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:51,972
We've been going through a breakup, so...

515
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:54,475
it's been pretty tough to work on.

516
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,143
[Miss Jackson] It's fine, Nate.

517
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,687
Why don't you just start
with some of the symbolism?

518
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,064
Okay.

519
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,112
So...

520
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,573
I painted a...

521
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,909
casserole dish...

522
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,579
[laughs]

523
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:30,010
...around her pussy...

524
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:35,474
because I love how her pussy
tastes like tuna casserole.

525
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,270
[Miss Jackson] Wow, Nate,
that's really beautiful.

526
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,773
You know, there's a phenomenon
called bacterial vaginosis...

527
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,859
and when there's an overgrowth

528
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,945
of a perfectly naturally-occurring
bacteria in the vagina,

529
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,240
-it causes that fishy odor.
-[Nate] Okay, Miss Jackson.

530
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,826
I don't want to know
all the magician's tricks.

531
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,911
[laughs]

532
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,166
Anyway...

533
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,545
it was pretty tough to work on her face
because she's just...

534
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,797
so beautiful and...

535
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:10,050
I couldn't stand to look at her anymore,
and...

536
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:12,261
I'm sorry, Miss Jackson. I just--

537
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:16,098
I just really can't give
this presentation right now. It's too raw.

538
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,851
-I got to get out of here.
-[Miss Jackson] Nate! Wait.

539
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,150
[Nate] Yeah?

540
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:30,321
[Miss Jackson] I'm sorry I pushed you
to give that presentation.

541
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,323
I didn't realize you were so...

542
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,408
sensitive.

543
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,704
[Nate] Yeah, I guess I am...

544
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,123
sensitive.

545
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,793
[Miss Jackson]
Listen, I'd like to make it up to you.

546
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,963
I have an extra ticket
to this show tonight called Nate.

547
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,882
[Nate] Nate? That's my name.

548
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,801
[Miss Jackson] Yeah,
that's why I thought you might like it.

549
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,180
Would you want to come with me?

550
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,266
[Nate] Fuck, yeah. [laughs]

551
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,186
[both laughing]

552
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,776
[Nate] Oh, my God.
That guy was hilarious! [laughs]

553
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,111
Shit. Huh...

554
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,534
That tiny motorcycle? Genius. [laughs]

555
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,329
[Miss Jackson] I know.
I can't believe I let him grab my tits!

556
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:21,997
[laughs]

557
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,582
[Nate] Yeah, so crazy.

558
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,461
[Miss Jackson] I just didn't really get
why he pulled out an axe.

559
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,712
[Nate shrugs]

560
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,675
Yeah, he lost me there.

561
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,427
[grunts]

562
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,556
Anyway, I think we're both pretty drunk.

563
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,934
Can I-- Can I call you a Lyft?

564
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:44,061
[Miss Jackson] Actually, I prefer Uber.

565
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,607
[Nate] Wow! You're the exact opposite...

566
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,819
of my ex. [chuckles]

567
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:56,448
[Miss Jackson] But you know what?
I don't really want to go home right now.

568
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,160
It's so beautiful out here
overlooking Niagara Falls.

569
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,497
[Nate] Yeah.

570
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:11,297
Look, you can see the United States
of America from here.

571
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:18,512
[Miss Jackson] Wow!

[Nate] Wow, that's a beautiful song.

575
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,330
What is that?

576
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,874
[laughs]

577
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,837
Oh, my gosh.
Miss Jackson, you're shivering.

578
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,673
-Do you want my jacket?
-[Miss Jackson] Yeah, if you don't mind.

579
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,175
[Nate] No, of course not.

580
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:59,011
Wouldn't want you getting cold
while we look up at the stars.

583

[Nate] Constellations? Sure do.

584
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:14,318
There's Orion's Belt,
and there's the Big Dipper.

00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,757
-Coming.
-Okay.

676
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,224
Thank you. Huh...

677
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,312
This is Miss Jackson,
my art teacher I was telling you about.

678
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,190
We were on a date and we...

679
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:11,443
We both had a little too much to drink...

680
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:13,278
and she passed out.

681
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,574
So, I just need some help
getting her home.

682
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,370
-Okay.
-Do you want to...?

683
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,706
You wanna grab her legs?

684
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:26,833
Sure.

685
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,006
Huh, just one sec.

686
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,347
Is what I did wrong?

687
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,854
[man 4] Yeah.

688
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,189
[Nate] Yeah?

689
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,737
Is what I did wrong?

690
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,454
-Just a yes or no.
-[laughs]

691
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,874
-[man 5] No.
-[woman 7] No.

692
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,043
-[Nate] No?
-[man 6] It's not wrong. She passed out.

693
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:10,961
Yes?

694
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,796
[woman 8] She said it right after...

695
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:13,964
-[woman 9] Yes.
-[man 7] Yeah.

-[woman 11] No.
-[woman 12] Yes.

700
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,098
[woman 13] You asked.

701
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,812
It's confusing, huh?

702
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,735
All right, she just lives
right back there, man.

703
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:40,031

Yeah.

Thank you. Thanks again.

I gotta wash that off.

I don't think he meant
to do anything wrong. I just...

00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,956
I don't remember.

729
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,668
I mean, I remember eating his ass.

00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,800
But not much after that.

hm...

We were both too drunk,

00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:31,906
and we shouldn't have had sex.

756
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:34,826
So, I wanted to say

757

I'm sorry I raped you.

[Miss Jackson] Nate, I mean...

759
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,920
you were drunk too, and I ate your ass
and made you suck your own dick.

So, I'm sorry

761
