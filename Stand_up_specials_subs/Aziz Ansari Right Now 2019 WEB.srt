By the way, this guy's with me.

He's, uh... he's authorized.

He's not, like,
a very audacious bootlegger

31
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:00,588
who really doesn't give a fuck.

Uh...

36
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,088
Yeah, we're filming these shows,

37
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:14,505
so, you know, you might be in the show,
uh, when it's on,

38
00:02:14,796 --> 00:02:15,796
whatever I put it on.

39
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,796

41
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,338
But we're filming a few shows,

42
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:23,380
so if you're, like, the shitty crowd,
we won't use any of the footage.

I'm psyched to be here.
I-I've been on the road for a while.

46
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:32,338
Um, I just got back to New York,
uh, my home,

47
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,713
uh, a few days ago,

48
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,671
-and, uh, yeah.

00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,588
[clears throat]

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,838
I, uh...

51
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:41,546
I was walking around the other day,

52
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,546
and this guy, uh,
came up to me on the street,

53
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,880
and he was like, uh,

54
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:49,838
"Hey, man. Love the Netflix show!"
And I was like, "Oh, thanks so much."

55
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:53,213
He was like, "Yeah, yeah, I really liked
the episode you did on Supreme!"

56
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:54,421
I was like, "What?

57
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:55,546
[laughter]

58
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,630
I didn't do no episode on Supreme."

59
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:01,505
And then I quickly realized
he's talking about Hasan Minhaj.

60
00:03:01,588 --> 00:03:03,671
-[laughter]
-Patriot Act.

61
00:03:04,171 --> 00:03:05,546
Different show.

62
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,005
Different guy.

63
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,171
[laughter]

64
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,713
And he felt horrible, right?

65
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:13,463
He immediately realized his mistake,
and he was trying to buy it back.

66
00:03:13,546 --> 00:03:15,171
He was like, "Oh, no, no, Aziz, right?"

67
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,088
I was like, "Yeah, yeah. That's me."

68
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:19,421
"Master of None!"
"Yeah, yeah. That's me."

69
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,630
"Parks and Rec."
"Yeah, yeah. That's me."

70
00:03:21,838 --> 00:03:24,171
"Treat yo' self."
"Yeah, yeah. That's me."

71
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:27,296
"And, uh, you had that whole thing
last year, sexual misconduct?"

72
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,921
"No, no, no, no, no!

73
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,463
That was Hasan."

74
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,796
[laughter]

75
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,713
[applause]

76
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,755
You know, I...

77
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:44,713
I haven't said much
about that whole thing, um,

78
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:47,005
but I've talked about it on this tour,

79
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,921
'cause you're here,
and it means a lot to me.

80
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:53,921
And I'm sure some of you are curious
how I feel about that whole situation.

81
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,380
And, uh, it's a tricky thing
for me to answer,

82
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,671
'cause I've felt so many things
in the last year, so...

83
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:04,046
There's times I felt scared.

84
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,463
There's times I felt humiliated.

85
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:09,046
There's times I felt embarrassed.

86
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:10,671
And ultimately,

87
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:14,880
I just felt terrible
that this person felt this way.

88
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,213
And after a year or so,
I just hope it was a step forward.

89
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:22,880
It moved things forward for me
and made me think about a lot.

90
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,755
I hope I've become a better person.

91
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,421
And I always think about a conversation
I had with one of my friends

92
00:04:27,505 --> 00:04:29,130
where he was like, "You know what, man?

93
00:04:29,213 --> 00:04:33,921
That whole thing made me think
about every date I've ever been on."

94
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:36,796
And I thought,
"Wow. Well, that's pretty incredible.

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,755
It's made not just me,
but other people be more thoughtful,

96
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:42,713
and that's a good thing."

97
00:04:42,796 --> 00:04:44,630
And that's how I feel about it.

98
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,463
And I know...

99
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,921
this isn't the most hilarious way
to begin a comedy show.

100
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:50,838
[laughter]

101
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:54,838
But it's important to me that you know
how I feel about that whole thing

102
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,671
before we share this night together.

103
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,838
[cheering and applause]

104
00:05:08,838 --> 00:05:10,838
Well, that was pretty intense.

105
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:12,005
[laughter]

106
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:14,046
What else shall we talk about?

107
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,046
[laughter]

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,796
America?

109
00:05:18,088 --> 00:05:20,130
Everyone's very worried right now.

110
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,130
A lot of people are bummed.

111
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:26,046
People are like, "Oh, my God.
Shit has hit the fan."

112
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,755
I'm not worried, though.

113
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:30,380
You know why? 'Cause...

114
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,630
this is America, okay?

115
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:37,046
Shit didn't hit the fan,
shit's always been on the fan, okay?

116
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:39,505
There's never been a clean fan out there.

117
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,630
There's always been shit up there.

118
00:05:41,713 --> 00:05:45,546
Every generation of Americans
has had their shit.

119
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,630
And they've persevered,

120
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,546
and we will as well, okay?

121
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,546
And some of those generations have had
even crazier shit than we do, right?

122
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,546
Things like the Depression,

123
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,046
Vietnam, the draft...

124
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,380
Could you imagine if we had a draft?

125
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:01,380
[laughter]

126
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:02,838
With today's people?

127
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,463
[laughter]

128
00:06:04,546 --> 00:06:06,838
"Uh, I can't go to war.
I just started this company.

129
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:08,880
We make eco-friendly shoes
out of cashews.

130
00:06:08,963 --> 00:06:10,713
They're called "Cashoes".

131
00:06:10,796 --> 00:06:11,963
[laughter]

132
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,671
Just a few generations before,
they'd give that guy a rifle,

133
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:19,880
they're like,
"Go shoot some Asian people!"

134
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,213
Now he's at work like,

135
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:23,921
"Uh, it's not pronounced 'pho', Valerie,
it's 'faa.'"

136
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:24,838
[laughter]

137
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:25,880
His grandfather...

138
00:06:25,963 --> 00:06:28,296
[screaming]

139
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,296
[laughs]

140
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,671
But I promise you,

141
00:06:33,421 --> 00:06:34,588
we're gonna be okay,

142
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,713
'cause despite how it may seem,

143
00:06:37,005 --> 00:06:41,296
we still have a capacity for listening,
for understanding.

144
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,463
I'll give you an example, okay?

145
00:06:43,796 --> 00:06:45,046
There was a story I read.

146
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:49,505
This girl goes to her high school prom.
White girl. She wears an Asian garment.

147
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:52,671
And there's an Asian kid at the school
and he's offended.

148
00:06:53,005 --> 00:06:54,713
He actually did something really cool.

149
00:06:54,796 --> 00:06:57,546
He actually went up to her
and they had a conversation.

150
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:00,796
He explained his concerns
about cultural appropriation.

151
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,838
She assured him she was coming
from a place of respect and admiration.

152
00:07:05,046 --> 00:07:07,713
And they both learned
about each other's perspectives.

153
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:10,671
And it was a really--
Just kidding. None of that shit happened.

154
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,963
Oh! Why would that happen?

155
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,838
No, he just Tweeted out her pictures
and wrote,

156
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:19,463
"My culture's not
your goddamn prom dress!"

157
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:20,463
[laughter]

158
00:07:20,796 --> 00:07:23,130
And this became global news!

159
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:25,588
And there was articles,
and comments, and tweets.

160
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:27,296
And I read all of 'em.

161
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:30,713
And my favorite thing is
you go on these threads,

162
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:34,255
and you'd see people arguing,
trying to, like, out-woke each other.

163
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:36,213
You know what I mean?
Like, one person'd be like,

164
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:38,963
"Oh, I can't believe she'd just steal
from Chinese culture like that."

165
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:41,921
Another guy'd be like, "Actually,
the Chinese stole that from Malaysia."

166
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,630
And I was like, "Oh, shit!

167
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,255
You just got out-woked!

168
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,130
You thought your eyes were open.

169
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:50,713
This other dude doesn't even
have a forehead.

170
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:53,046
His eyeball just keeps going...

171
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:56,880
just so he can see all the injustice."

172
00:07:56,963 --> 00:07:58,005
[laughter]

173
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,380
Man, look, man. I saw the pictures.

174
00:08:01,463 --> 00:08:04,255
It didn't seem like this person's heart
was in the wrong place.

175
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:05,963
It's not like she tweeted,

283
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:30,463
My favorite thing, though,
one time I asked someone, I was like, uh,

284
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:31,671
"You like Crazy Rich Asians?"

285
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:34,380

I'm gonna be honest with you.

286
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:36,921

I didn't really enjoy it.

But then I watched it again
with one of my Asian friends,

288

to see herself represented on the screen,

290
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:47,380
and that made me really like the film."

291
00:12:47,963 --> 00:12:50,505
And I said, "Oh, um, that doesn't mean
you like the movie,

292
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:53,630
that's just a weird, condescending,
shitty thing to say."

with one of my chubby white friends...

302
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:16,338
But, look,
I'll give credit where credit's due.

303
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,588
I've been around 36 years.

304
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,796
I've never seen white people
trying this hard be nice to minorities.

305
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,171
I know there's some people
that are not trying at all,

306
00:13:23,255 --> 00:13:26,463
and some people going a bit aggressively
the other direction...

[laughter]

308
00:13:27,463 --> 00:13:32,005
But overall, I'd say this edition
of white people is trying the hardest.

309
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:35,380
And I think it's cool,
and I appreciate it.

00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:49,380
Doesn't it seem a little weird sometimes?
Doesn't it seem a little strange?

315
00:13:49,463 --> 00:13:51,505
Almost like some people are playing a game

316
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:54,630
where they're, like, tallying up points
for doing nice stuff.

317
00:13:54,713 --> 00:13:57,546
Like, is there some sort
of secret, progressive Candy Crush

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,671
And look, I know there's some people
sitting here like, "Come on, Aziz.

348
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:05,671
What the hell?

349
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:08,005
I'm white. I don't do this shit, okay?

350
00:15:08,088 --> 00:15:11,338
I'm here, watching you,
supporting minorities in the arts!"

351
00:15:11,463 --> 00:15:12,463
[laughter]

352
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,421
[imitates chime]

353
00:15:13,505 --> 00:15:14,588
[laughter]

354
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,463
It's a weird time to be working on jokes.

355
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,588
Gotta be very careful
about what you say, right?

356
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:27,463
I've seen people in regular jobs
getting in trouble these days, you know?

357
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:32,046
I recently saw some people got in trouble
for, uh, saying the word "niggardly."

358
00:15:32,546 --> 00:15:34,630
Which, take it easy,
has nothing to do with race.

359
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:36,171
It just means cheap or stingy.

360
00:15:36,255 --> 00:15:38,921
You can look up the etymology,
it's a completely innocent word.

361
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,671
And people are getting in trouble for it.

362
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:41,921
Which is crazy.

363
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:46,755
But... it seems like they could've
just said cheap or stingy, right?

364
00:15:46,838 --> 00:15:47,880
[laughter]

365
00:15:47,963 --> 00:15:50,130
I don't know why they had
to walk the plank on this one.

366
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,088
"Mmm...

367
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,505
I know what it sounds like.

368
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,046
But I want to use my big word!

369
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,005
What do you mean
you're getting a regular ticket?

370
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:02,963
Let's get a Fast Pass.
Quit being so niggardly!"

371
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,005
[laughter]

372
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:09,630
One of the guys that got in trouble,
he's a senator from Ohio, right?

373
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:11,088
His name's Sherrod Brown.

374
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,296
They had a meeting
about military spending.

375
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,671
And he goes to the legislators,

376
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:17,213
"You all, when it comes to spending
on the weapons and the wars,

377
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:18,880
you all want to spend very lavishly,

378
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:22,213
but when the veterans come home,
you start acting very niggardly."

379
00:16:22,463 --> 00:16:24,713
-They're like, "Uh, what'd you say?"
-[laughter]

380
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:27,088
"I said,
'You just start acting very niggardly.'"

381
00:16:27,171 --> 00:16:29,796
"Uh, just the last word again, Sherrod?"
"I said, 'Niggardly.'"

382
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,546
"Get him out of here!"

383
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:33,546
And he got in all this trouble.

384
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,963
And then,
they looked it up in the dictionary,

385
00:16:36,046 --> 00:16:37,213
and he was fine.

386
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,046
[laughter]

387
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,088
But when I first read the article,
I was really confused,

388
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:44,755
'cause I read his name as Sherrod Brown,

389
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,546
and I was like, "Uh, seems like
Sherrod Brown should be okay here, right?

390
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,546
[laughter]

391
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,005
Am I missing something here,
Sherrod Brown?

392
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,463
Do I not have all the facts? Uh...

393
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,880
Oh, he's a white guy?
Get him out of here!" No.

394
00:16:56,963 --> 00:16:57,796
[laughter]

395
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,505
It's a completely innocent word.

396
00:17:00,046 --> 00:17:00,921
Nothing wrong with it.

397
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:02,588
So, you know, white dude in the front,

398
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:05,796
if you want to put it in rotation
every now and then, go for it.

399
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,755
Nothing wrong with it.

400
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:09,421
I just explained to you, there's nothing
wrong with the word, right?

401
00:17:09,755 --> 00:17:10,880
Right? You got it.

402
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,296
So, why don't you just yell it
into the microphone right now?

403
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,255
Okay, here we go, let's do it. Here we go.
Let's go. Here we go. Let's go, let's go.

404
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:18,171
Here we go.

405
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:21,380
He was about to do it!
Can you believe it, guys? Come on, sir!

406
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,546
That's not cool.

407
00:17:23,296 --> 00:17:24,880
That was a test and you failed!

408
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,671
You can't just throw it around
willy-nilly.

409
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,213
Maybe if it comes up
in your life organically,

410
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,755
then you can consider throwing it in.

411
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:34,505
I don't know what the scenario is,
maybe, uh...

412
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:38,171
Maybe go out to dinner
with your African-American boss, right?

413
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:41,213
And... he grabs the bill,
and then you look at the tip.

414
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:44,380
You're like, "Mm, I don't know, sir,
seems a bit niggardly." Like, that...

415
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,213
seems okay. [laughs]

416
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:52,088
Gotta be careful about what you say.

417
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,463
And about what you said, right?

418
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:58,171
'Cause they'll dig up the old tweets.

419
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:00,296
They'll find the old clips.

420
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,463
You know what's strange
about that whole thing, though?

421
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:06,463
Is like... you ever just watch
very popular mainstream stuff

422
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:08,005
from not that long ago?

423
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,963
Uh, there's stuff in there, guys! [laughs]

424
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:12,671
I was watching The Hangover the other day.

425
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:15,463
This is one of the biggest movies ever,
right? It's not that old.

426
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:17,671
There's a scene in that movie
where Bradley Cooper goes,

427
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:19,380
"Paging Dr. Faggot!"

428
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,421
That's in the movie!

429
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:22,338
[laughter]

430
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:25,463
Did you guys write a letter?
I didn't write a letter.

431
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:26,588
[laughter]

432
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:30,255
Not only is it in the movie,
it's in the trailer for the movie!

433
00:18:30,338 --> 00:18:32,463
-[laughter]
-You know why it was in the trailer?

434
00:18:32,546 --> 00:18:33,921
'Cause they did test readings,

435
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:36,963
and whenever Bradley Cooper went,
"Paging Dr. Faggot,"

436
00:18:37,046 --> 00:18:39,921
everyone went, "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
This movie rules!

437
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:41,838
I love that word!"

438
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,005
[laughter]

439
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:47,130
You can watch stuff that's not that old

440
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,880
with 2019 eyes
and things can seem weird now.

441
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,546
Like... like, I was watching a...
a rerun of The Office.

442
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,671
What's the biggest story?

443
00:18:53,755 --> 00:18:56,130
"Jim and Pam.
Oh, I hope they get together!"

444
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:58,588
You watch it now, though,
it's like, "Mmh, I don't know.

445
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:01,338
This lady's engaged. He's been
hitting on her for, like, four seasons.

446
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:03,630
I don't know if this is cool
in the workplace.

447
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:04,546
[laughter]

448
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,421
If they rebooted The Office now,

449
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:09,921
it'd end with Pam winning
a landmark sexual harassment case.

450
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:11,005
[laughter]

451
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:12,713
And then, in the series finale,

452
00:19:12,796 --> 00:19:14,880
you'd find out
that's what the documentary was,

453
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:17,421
they were just gathering evidence
against Jim!

454
00:19:17,505 --> 00:19:18,713
[laughter]

455
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:26,213
I was even watching my own show.
I was watching a Parks and Rec rerun.

456
00:19:26,296 --> 00:19:29,005
I love Parks, love my Parks family.

457
00:19:29,088 --> 00:19:32,380
But I was watching some season's rerun,
and I was like, "Eee, I don't know.

458
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,755
Like, we had a whole scene in the show

459
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:38,380
where my character Tom gets a gift
for Rashida Jones's character.

460
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:40,713
Right? I get her a teddy bear.

461
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:44,046
But the teddy bear has a nanny cam in it.

462
00:19:44,296 --> 00:19:46,130
Nuh...

463
00:19:46,213 --> 00:19:48,005
I feel like if I got script today,
I'd be like,

464
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,880
-"Mmh, yeah, I'm not doing this one, guys.
-[laughter]

465
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:53,338
Pretty sure
Tom would go to jail for that."

466
00:19:53,421 --> 00:19:55,088
-[laughter]
-But back then, I was like,

467
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:58,088
"Oh, I get it. Now I can see
inside her house. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

468
00:19:58,171 --> 00:19:59,255
[laughter]

469
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:04,505
But that's very interesting.
What does that mean?

470
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:07,463
Does that mean me and the people
that made Parks are bad people?

471
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,630
No. It was a different cultural context.

472
00:20:09,713 --> 00:20:12,463
You can't judge everything
by 2019 standards.

473
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:15,338
Sure, some things, of course,
but not everything.

474
00:20:15,713 --> 00:20:19,546
Yeah? I guess what I'm saying is,
"Look, we're all shitty people, okay?

475
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,796
-[laughter]
-And we have our blind spots.

476
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,963
And we become aware,
and we slowly get better.

477
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:26,255
We're all on a journey.
And if you're sitting there, like,

478
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,588
"I'm not shitty. I'm aware
of all the marginalized groups."

479
00:20:28,671 --> 00:20:31,171
-You're extra shitty, okay?
-[laughter]

480
00:20:31,255 --> 00:20:32,671
'Cause you're arrogant.

481
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:34,963
Have some humility.

482
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:36,838
[cheering and applause]

483
00:20:38,921 --> 00:20:41,046
Don't you realize in 50 years

484
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,130
we're all gonna look back
and feel like complete assholes?

485
00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,088
-[laughter]
-Like, isn't that the dream,

486
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:47,130
in a way?

487
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:48,671
That 50 years from now, we look back,

488
00:20:48,755 --> 00:20:50,796
we can't even justify ourselves
to our grandkids.

489
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,505
We're just sitting there like, "Uh, yeah.

490
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:54,588
I don't know what the fuck
was going on. Um...

491
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,505
[laughter]

492
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,755
There was just homeless people everywhere
and no-one gave a shit. Uh...

493
00:20:59,838 --> 00:21:02,046
You'd just kind of avoid eye contact,
walk around 'em,

494
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,630
hope it wasn't one of the ones
that'd chase you down.

495
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:07,380
Every now and then they'd have cups out
and you'd open up your wallet

496
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,255
and be like,
"Uh, sorry, all I got's twenties."

497
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:12,796
And then you'd hop on one of those weird
scooters and get the fuck out of there!

498
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,380
[laughter]

499
00:21:14,463 --> 00:21:16,130
It was a weird time, 2019.

500
00:21:16,755 --> 00:21:18,671
We put every single black guy in jail.

501
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:20,630
Every single black guy was in jail,

502
00:21:20,713 --> 00:21:24,671
except for, like, Drake, LeVar Burton,
and that little kid from Stranger Things.

503
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:25,630
[laughter]

504
00:21:25,713 --> 00:21:28,130
Besides them,
we put every single black guy in jail

505
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:29,755
for, like, a little bit of weed.

506
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:32,921
And then we made weed legal
and we just left 'em in there.

507
00:21:33,005 --> 00:21:36,213
I don't know, it seems like
we could have made a couple of calls.

508
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:37,546
[applause]

509
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,963
[cheering and applause]

510
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:46,046
Cultural context, right,
could change everything.

511
00:21:46,546 --> 00:21:48,171
Look at all this R. Kelly stuff.

512
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:50,671
All this information was out there
in the past, right?

513
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:52,963
There was the Aaliyah thing,
there were the tapes,

514
00:21:53,046 --> 00:21:55,713
and everyone just kind of
looked the other way, right?

515
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:58,796
But now, the culture
has reached a breaking point.

516
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:03,005
Now that there's a bingeable
six hour documentary, the culture's like,

517
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,421
"Hey, it's one thing
for all this information to be out there

518
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:06,671
in a 20-page long read,

519
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:10,588
but now that it's been packaged
in an entertaining fashion, no more!"

520
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:11,671
[laughter]

521
00:22:12,796 --> 00:22:13,713
I watched it.

522
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:15,796
Intense.

523
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:20,213
Just out of curiosity, you guys,
clap if you're done with R. Kelly.

524
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:21,630
Clap if you're done with R. Kelly.

525
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:23,505
-[cheering and applause]
-Yeah.

526
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:24,630
Wow.

527
00:22:25,088 --> 00:22:26,796
A lot of people.

528
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,380
Yeah. I mean,
it was a very compelling piece.

529
00:22:30,463 --> 00:22:32,463
A lot of people putting out statements
and stuff now.

530
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:33,963
People that used to work with him.

531
00:22:34,046 --> 00:22:37,213
People like Lady Gaga, Chance the Rapper.

532
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,338
You know who I haven't seen
a statement from?

533
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,130
This guy right here.
Nothing from you, sir!

534
00:22:43,921 --> 00:22:45,713
-Sir, what's your name up here?
-Dan.

535
00:22:45,796 --> 00:22:47,755
-Dan, what's your last name?
-Greenblatt.

536
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:49,046
Dan Greenblatt.

537
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,671
I've seen nothing from Dan Greenblatt.

538
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:52,838
But why would I, Dan?

539
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:56,005
There's no documentation
of your R. Kelly patronage, right?

540
00:22:56,588 --> 00:22:58,255
You're very lucky in that regard.

541
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:00,630
Wouldn't that be embarrassing?

542
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,630
What if you were watching
that documentary, right,

543
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,671
and they're like,
"Oh, and then the tape comes out"

544
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:07,505
At this point, you've got to know
something's not right.

545
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,046
But people didn't care.

546
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:12,921
Here's footage of Dan Greenblatt
just one week after the tape was released.

547
00:23:13,005 --> 00:23:16,255
♪ It's a remix to ignition
I got them fresh out of the kitchen ♪

548
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:17,546
♪ I got the rollin'-- ♪

549
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,088
Here's footage of Dan
just two weeks later,

550
00:23:20,171 --> 00:23:21,130
driving to work.

551
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:23,005
♪ I'm sippin' on Coke and rum ♪

552
00:23:23,088 --> 00:23:26,338
♪ I'm like, "So, what? I'm drunk"
It's the rar, rar, rar, rar" ♪

553
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:28,921
You're lucky
they don't have that footage, Dan.

554
00:23:29,005 --> 00:23:31,088
You know you got down to those tunes.

555
00:23:32,463 --> 00:23:34,213
Wouldn't that be so awful?

556
00:23:34,296 --> 00:23:36,588
What if they had footage of you
from, like, 18 years ago?

557
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:40,755
Maybe, uh, you know, talking about going
to an R. Kelly concert.

558
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:43,838
Talking about how you had a great time
and how it was so silly.

559
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,630
Wouldn't that be awful? You know
who they do have footage of like that?

560
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:48,921
-Me!
-[laughter]

561
00:23:49,296 --> 00:23:53,005
Yeah, it's the end of my first
stand-up special. I put it out myself.

562
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,046
[laughter]

563
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,505
I had this whole bit
at the end of my first stand-up special.

564
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:59,796
I'm like, "I went to an R. Kelly concert.
It was crazy!"

565
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,713
[laughter]

566
00:24:00,796 --> 00:24:03,421
I don't do that shit now,
but it's still out there.

567
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:06,255
And I'm watching this documentary,
I'm terrified!

568
00:24:06,755 --> 00:24:09,588
I'm like, "Man,
they'd better not pull up them clips!

569
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:12,296
I've had a tricky year as it is."

570
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,380
[laughter]

571
00:24:16,005 --> 00:24:17,713
[cheering and applause]

572
00:24:21,588 --> 00:24:24,505
'Cause... I listened to it
the other day, guys,

573
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,171
and the bit has not aged well.

574
00:24:27,255 --> 00:24:28,296
[laughter]

575
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,880
Like, all the wording I used
is the worst possible wording.

576
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:36,463
And I'm imagining Wendy Williams
or whoever

577
00:24:36,546 --> 00:24:38,546
going to one of these clubs
where I'm on stage like,

578
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,338
"You know, guys, my favorite musician
I've ever met is R. Kelly!"

579
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:45,588
[dramatic voice] "His favorite musician
he's ever met...

580
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:47,130
is R. Kelly.

581
00:24:47,713 --> 00:24:48,713
And it doesn't end there.

582
00:24:48,796 --> 00:24:51,296
Let's look at a clip
from Aziz's second stand-up special,

583
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,546
which came out just two years later."

584
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,130
"You know, guys, in my last special,
I talked about R. Kelly.

585
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:58,088
And I figured I don't need
to do that this time,

586
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:02,046
but here's the problem,
R. Kelly keeps doing amazing things!

587
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,005
Amazing things!

588
00:25:04,088 --> 00:25:05,838
Amazing things!

589
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,755
Amazing things!

590
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:10,963
[deep voice] Amazing things!"

591
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:11,880
[laughter]

592
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:12,880
[whistling]

593
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:14,796
[cheering and applause]

594
00:25:17,713 --> 00:25:19,838
You know what's weird
is I was watching that special,

595
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:22,671
and there was a lot of jokes on there
I'd forgotten.

596
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,255
It was, like, ten years old, you know?

597
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:27,005
There was bits, I was like,
"Ooh, I don't know if I'd say that today."

598
00:25:27,088 --> 00:25:29,296
I felt bad.
Then I was like, "Eh, that's fine."

599
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,005
That's the way it's supposed to be, right?

600
00:25:31,088 --> 00:25:33,671
If you're the same person
you were ten years ago, you're shitty!

601
00:25:33,755 --> 00:25:35,380
Like, you're supposed to change.

602
00:25:36,213 --> 00:25:38,838
But there was jokes on there,
like, I wouldn't do that now, you know?

603
00:25:38,921 --> 00:25:42,130
Like, I had this old bit where I used
to talk about my little cousin Harris,

604
00:25:42,213 --> 00:25:43,088
-and, uh...
-[applause]

605
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:45,213
Yeah, yeah, thank you, whatever.
And, uh...

606
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:46,296
[laughter]

607
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,296
I-I had this joke in there where I would
talk about how he watched weird TV shows

608
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,630
and how he's a little chubby.

609
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:53,338
I had one bit where I was like,
"Know what?

610
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,838
There's not a lot of chubby Indian kids!
It's kind of a rarity.

611
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:59,796
It's kind of like seeing a shooting star,
only it's fat, brown, and on the ground."

612
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:01,255
It's fine, whatever,

613
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:03,921
but I feel like if I had thought
of that joke today, I'd be like,

614
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:08,255
"Uh, probably no reason to fat shame
my little cousin on a global scale.

615
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:09,255
[laughter]

616
00:26:09,338 --> 00:26:11,296
Maybe I'll tuck that one aside."

617
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,296
[laughter]

618
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,796
But back then, I was 25.

619
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,463
I was like, "I've got to fill this hour,
I don't give a shit!"

620
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:19,505
-[laughter]
-I just threw little Harris under the bus.

621
00:26:19,588 --> 00:26:20,796
[laughter]

622
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,005
Well, he is a little chubby,
so, technically, I squeezed him in, right?

623
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:25,171
[laughter]

624
00:26:25,921 --> 00:26:26,963
[laughs]

625
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,546
He's fine.

626
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,755
He got internships and stuff
'cause of that bit.

627
00:26:31,838 --> 00:26:32,713
[laughter]

628
00:26:32,796 --> 00:26:35,380
Yeah! People were like,
"What? You're that Harris?"

629
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:36,380
[laughter]

630
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,755
And he's not chubby no more.

631
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:41,296
He's like super buff.
He goes to gym all the time.

632
00:26:42,046 --> 00:26:44,421
-Probably 'cause he was scarred for life.
-[laughter]

633
00:26:44,505 --> 00:26:47,671
"I'm not a shooting star!
I'm not a shooting star!"

634
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:48,713
[laughter]

635
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:53,421
I watched that, uh...

636
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,755
I watched
that Michael Jackson documentary.

637
00:26:56,088 --> 00:26:58,130
Ooh, I don't know if you had a chance
to see this one,

638
00:26:58,213 --> 00:27:00,630
but let's just say hypothetically you did

639
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,338
and you're equally as convinced
as you are about R. Kelly.

640
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,796
Clap if you're done with Michael Jackson.
Clap if you're done.

641
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,171
[moderate applause]

642
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:13,380
What happened to all them R. Kelly claps?

643
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,171
That was way less people.

644
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:17,838
You guys are all collectively like,

645
00:27:17,921 --> 00:27:21,005
"Uh, I don't know what to tell you, Aziz.
The music's way better. Sorry, I...

646
00:27:21,088 --> 00:27:21,963
[laughter]

647
00:27:22,046 --> 00:27:25,963
I'll take the hit on Kells, but Michael
is a bridge I'm not willing to cross.

648
00:27:26,255 --> 00:27:28,505
I got a wedding next month,
let's be serious!"

649
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:29,713
[laughter]

650
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:31,921
Dan, nothing from you?

651
00:27:32,005 --> 00:27:32,921
[laughter]

652
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,505
Dan's like, "I heard it's, like, two kids.
I don't give a shit.

653
00:27:36,796 --> 00:27:39,588
Sorry, Aziz, I'm going home,
I'm listening to "Thriller,"

654
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:42,421
I'm watching The Cosby Show
and going to bed. Deal with it!"

655
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:43,588
[laughter]

656
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,213
All right. But, Dan. Okay.

657
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:50,213
Let's say... let's say another doc
comes out. Now it's worse.

658
00:27:50,296 --> 00:27:51,630
Now they're saying it's, like,

659
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,546
a thousand kids.
Now are you done with Michael Jackson?

660
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:57,338
Yeah. See?

661
00:27:57,671 --> 00:28:00,338
Dan is a man of principle, okay?

662
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:01,380
[laughter]

663
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:04,338
He was like, "Two kids are one thing,
but I got to draw the line somewhere,

664
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:07,213
and Dan's gonna draw the line
at a thousand kids!"

665
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,255
[laughter]

666
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:14,588
Isn't it weird we're just watching
this stuff as entertainment?

667
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:16,005
Right? Isn't that kind of strange?

668
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:19,213
Your friends were like,
"Oh, man. Have you seen that show

669
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:23,755
where those two guys graphically describe
being molested for four hours?"

670
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,546
"No."

671
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,630
[laughter]

672
00:28:26,713 --> 00:28:28,671
"You gotta watch it!"

673
00:28:28,755 --> 00:28:30,213
[laughter]

674
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,505
I don't know what went down,

675
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:39,005
but I will say that it did seem
like something weird was happening

676
00:28:39,088 --> 00:28:40,713
and that Michael was kind
of a sick guy.

677
00:28:40,796 --> 00:28:44,255
And I wish the people around him
had done more to get him help.

678
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:45,671
You know?

679
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:48,921
Like... like, he would bring these kids
on tour and stuff.

680
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:52,963
I've been on tour. I know what it's like.
There are plenty of other people around.

681
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:55,255
I got a tour manager,
I got opening comedians,

682
00:28:55,338 --> 00:28:56,630
I got the venue staff.

683
00:28:56,713 --> 00:28:59,963
I feel like if I showed up on a Friday
and I was like,

684
00:29:00,046 --> 00:29:02,546
"Hey, guys. This is Justin.
He's gonna be with me all week."

685
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,880
[laughter]

686
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:16,963
"Um...

687
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,755
-Aziz, Justin's six."
-[laughter]

688
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:21,463
"But he's my friend."

689
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,421
-"Um...
-[laughter]

690
00:29:25,963 --> 00:29:28,255
Maybe you need some friends
your own age."

691
00:29:28,588 --> 00:29:31,296
"Uh, but I didn't have a childhood.
I'm Peter Pan."

692
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,505
[laughter]

693
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:35,755
"No, you might be a pedophile.
Come on Justin.

694
00:29:35,838 --> 00:29:37,338
Let's get you to your parents.

695
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:40,088
Have a talk with your mom
about her priorities."

696
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:41,505
[laughter]

697
00:29:44,088 --> 00:29:45,046
[laughs]

698
00:29:45,755 --> 00:29:46,921
[laughter]

699
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:48,796
Stand up for a second.

700
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,963
[laughter]

701
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:52,130
I don't know this kid.

702
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:53,255
[laughter]

703
00:29:54,546 --> 00:29:55,963
[cheering and applause]

704
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:56,921
[laughs]

705
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,963
You could have played Justin.

706
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:00,005
[laughter]

707
00:30:00,796 --> 00:30:03,880
This is my friend Justin.
He's gonna be with me all week. [laughs]

708
00:30:03,963 --> 00:30:05,838
[laughter and applause]

709
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:07,130
[cheering]

710
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:14,046
Why the fuck are you sitting
in the front row of this show?

711
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,380
[laughter]

712
00:30:17,755 --> 00:30:18,963
[cheering]

713
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:26,421
What was that, dad and two sons?

714
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:28,921
Well, uh... you know...

715
00:30:29,255 --> 00:30:30,588
[laughter]

716
00:30:31,255 --> 00:30:34,421
If that ends up in a special,
mom is not gonna  be pleased.

717
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:35,338
[laughter]

718
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:37,213
[angrily] "Way to go, Dad!"

719
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:38,463
[laughter]

720
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:44,255
What is your name?

721
00:30:44,338 --> 00:30:45,171
I'm Tyler.

722
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:47,630
-[Aziz] Tyler. And the other kid's name?
-I'm Dylan.

723
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:50,921
Dylan. Tyler and Dylan. Okay.
How old are you, Tyler?

724
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:52,130
-Ten.
-[Aziz] Ten?

725
00:30:52,213 --> 00:30:53,255
Oh, shit!

726
00:30:53,338 --> 00:30:54,630
[laughter]

727
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,463
Perfectly cast!

728
00:30:56,546 --> 00:30:57,963
[laughter]

729
00:31:00,963 --> 00:31:02,046
Jesus.

730
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,213
[laughter]

731
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:04,838
What's your name, Dad?

732
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,130
-Uh, Ben.
-[Aziz] Ben, okay.

733
00:31:08,588 --> 00:31:11,255
[sighs] You made an awkward decision
bringing these kids.

734
00:31:11,338 --> 00:31:12,505
[laughter]

735
00:31:17,713 --> 00:31:20,213
You know, the other thing that's tricky
about the Michael thing is

736
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,296
[stammers] I don't know what to think

737
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,255
'cause I have the internet,

738
00:31:24,546 --> 00:31:28,380
and the internet can confirm
anything you want to believe, right?

739
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:33,171
You know, I can go on there,
I can type "Michael Jackson guilty."

740
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:34,671
And I'll be like, "What?

741
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:35,755
[laughter]

742
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:39,046
Michael is a monster.
I can't believe he'd do that."

743
00:31:39,546 --> 00:31:40,755
But then, I can go on there,

744
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:43,296
I can go on YouTube
and type "Michael Jackson innocent,"

745
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:44,671
and be like, "What?

746
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,088
Those kids set him up!"

747
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:48,296
[laughter]

748
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,171
I don't know what to believe,

749
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:53,505
'cause a YouTube video
can convince you of anything!

750
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,505
I watched a YouTube video once,
I was like, "Whoa,

751
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:58,380
am I in the Illuminati?

752
00:31:58,463 --> 00:32:00,296
-Like...
-[laughter]

753
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,255
This is some compelling evidence
they've put together."

754
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,380
I watched this video, it's like,
"Aziz Ansari: illuminati.

755
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:09,463
Look at his name. How does he spell it?

756
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:12,213
Two As. What do As have on the top
of them? Triangles.

757
00:32:12,296 --> 00:32:13,421
Two triangles.

758
00:32:13,505 --> 00:32:15,630
What else does he have in his name?
Two Is.

759
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:17,796
A-Z-I-Z, A-N-S-A-R-I.

760
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,505
Two Is, two triangles.

761
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:21,546
What does he have in his head?
Two eyes.

762
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,671
Aziz Ansari: illuminati."

763
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,088
[laughter]

764
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,880
[cheering and applause]

765
00:32:32,671 --> 00:32:33,546
[sighs]

766
00:32:35,546 --> 00:32:36,713
If Michael did do this stuff,

767
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:39,880
it's created, you know,
a weird cultural conundrum for us.

768
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:42,755
You know. 'Cause, you know,
music's very visceral.

769
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:44,296
It becomes a part of your life.

770
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:47,130
You know, my first memory of music itself,

771
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:51,463
is when I was probably
not that much younger than Tyler.

772
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:52,505
And I remember...

773
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:53,463
[laughter]

774
00:32:53,546 --> 00:32:58,171
...listening to a Michael Jackson
cassette, to Thriller.

775
00:32:58,255 --> 00:32:59,796
That was my first memory of music ever.

776
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,588
What's your first memory of music ever,
Tyler? Like, the first song

777
00:33:02,671 --> 00:33:04,755
you remember putting on
and listening to, you remember?

778
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:07,463
-Probably "Thriller", actually.
-Probably "Thriller"?

779
00:33:08,255 --> 00:33:09,130
Which song?

780
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:11,713
-What do you mean?
-Which song from Thriller?

781
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:13,880
Oh, "Thriller", the song "Thriller"?
Oh, okay.

782
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:17,255
But how do you erase that stuff
from your life, Tyler?

783
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:19,213
[laughter]

784
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:26,088
It becomes a part of you, right?

785
00:33:27,921 --> 00:33:30,463
You know what I always thought
would be the craziest conundrum?

786
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:32,380
What if in 1999,

787
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:34,713
Osama bin Laden put out...

788
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,880
an incredible jazz album?

789
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:38,296
[laughter]

790
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,046
And people are like,
"This is seminal work.

791
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,880
This is Miles Coltrane bin Laden," right?

792
00:33:44,963 --> 00:33:45,838
[laughter]

793
00:33:45,921 --> 00:33:48,671
Then that day, you're watching the news,
and the anchor's on there like,

794
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,880
"Uh, it appears the perpetrator
of the attacks was...

795
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,296
jazz legend, Osama bin Laden?

796
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
[laughter]

797
00:33:54,463 --> 00:33:57,338
The saxophone player?
Are we sure it's the same guy?

798
00:33:57,796 --> 00:33:59,880
Oh, my God, we're in complete shock
here in the studio.

799
00:33:59,963 --> 00:34:02,880
Uh, right now we have the representative
from his record label on the phone,

800
00:34:02,963 --> 00:34:05,171
this is Darren
from Bop Boppity Bop Bop Records.

801
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:06,963
Darren, what do you think about all this?"

802
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:10,421
"I'm in... I'm in complete shock.
I-I can't believe it.

803
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:13,796
I was with him a couple of weeks ago,
he couldn't have been a nicer guy."

804
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,338
"Really? A nice guy?"

805
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:18,296
"Well, I mean, you know,
he helped me move into my apartment.

806
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,880
-Uh...
-[laughter]

807
00:34:19,963 --> 00:34:22,838
Used to always pick me up
at the airport. Uh...

808
00:34:22,921 --> 00:34:26,088
Shit. I should probably
tell the FBI about that. Uh...

809
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:27,588
-[laughter]
-[inhales deeply]

810
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,630
[sighs] But I really can't believe it."

811
00:34:31,046 --> 00:34:32,796
"And what about the music, Darren?"

812
00:34:33,921 --> 00:34:35,713
[sighs] "Well, you know, we just...

813
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:38,838
recorded this Christmas album
with Michael Bublé,

814
00:34:38,921 --> 00:34:40,296
-and, uh...
-[laughter]

815
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,713
I got to be honest,

816
00:34:42,296 --> 00:34:43,130
it's sick.

817
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:44,380
[laughter]

818
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:46,171
But...

819
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,255
we're probably gonna have to shelve it."

820
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:51,755
"Probably will have to shelve it.

821
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:54,921
I think this might be a question
on a lot of jazz lovers' minds today:

822
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:57,838
Are we still going to be able
to enjoy this music?

823
00:34:58,296 --> 00:35:00,630
Uh, let's see what the viewers think.
Let's go to the phones.

824
00:35:00,713 --> 00:35:02,755
We have a gentleman calling
from Brooklyn, New York.

825
00:35:02,838 --> 00:35:04,838
This is Dan Greenblatt.

826
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:06,796
-Dan, what do you think?"
-[laughter]

827
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,838
"Meh, it's not like
it was a thousand buildings."

828
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,255
[laughter]

829
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:12,588
[applause]

830
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:15,421
[cheering]

831
00:35:16,963 --> 00:35:17,796
Um...

832
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:21,171
Oh. I don't know what's gonna happen
to Michael, but...

833
00:35:21,963 --> 00:35:24,630
I think R. Kelly's
in a little bit of a pickle.

834
00:35:24,713 --> 00:35:27,005
Uh... it seems like he's getting charged.

835
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:31,005
All of the companies have abandoned him.
RCA, Sony, all these places.

836
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:34,421
You know, nowadays,
you know, you have a big corporation,

837
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:37,546
even one employee does something,
the whole company's under fire, right?

838
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:40,005
You know, we saw this
with this whole Pizza Hut thing, right?

839
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,046
Guy orders a pepperoni pizza.

840
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,171
He gets the pizza,

841
00:35:43,255 --> 00:35:46,255
the pepperonis are arranged
to look like a swastika.

842
00:35:46,796 --> 00:35:49,963
But now some people online are saying
it doesn't look like a swastika.

843
00:35:50,046 --> 00:35:52,421
They're saying
it looks like a regular pizza.

844
00:35:52,505 --> 00:35:54,130
So the internet is split.

845
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:56,963
I saw it. It kinda looked
like a regular pizza to me.

846
00:35:57,046 --> 00:36:00,255
I don't know. What do you guys think?
Clap if you think it was a swastika.

847
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,046
Clap if you think
it looks like a swastika.

848
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,921
[little applause]

849
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:05,046
Okay. A couple in the back.

850
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,755
Now clap if you think
it just looks like a regular pizza.

851
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:09,380
[slightly more applause]

852
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:10,296
Yeah.

853
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,463
So, you, sir, right here...

854
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,838
You-- you think it looks
like a regular pizza?

855
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:19,213
Yeah? [stammers] And what, you think
this guy's just lying

856
00:36:19,296 --> 00:36:21,088
to get attention or something like that?
Yeah?

857
00:36:21,505 --> 00:36:22,963
And do you remember
where you saw it?

858
00:36:23,046 --> 00:36:25,505
'Cause, uh, it was in New York Times
and Washington Post,

859
00:36:25,588 --> 00:36:28,421
but Washington Post
supposedly accidentally posted

860
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,796
a digitally-altered photo.
Do you remember where you saw it?

861
00:36:31,963 --> 00:36:34,046
-Washington Post.
-You saw in Washington Post?

862
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,130
Okay. Well, you know
what's interesting is, um...

863
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:40,005
I just made all that up.
None of that happened.

864
00:36:40,088 --> 00:36:41,255
[laughter]

865
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,005
I'm not trying to embarrass you, dude,
but you and everyone that clapped earlier,

866
00:36:50,088 --> 00:36:51,880
you're the fucking problem, okay?

867
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:54,380
What are you doing?

868
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,213
This is where we're at now?

869
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,463
You think your opinion's so valuable

870
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:04,921
you need to chime in on shit
that doesn't even exist?

871
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:06,213
[cheering]

872
00:37:06,296 --> 00:37:09,630
I mean, I do this every night.
Every night, people clap.

873
00:37:09,713 --> 00:37:11,088
First, the first group claps.

874
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:13,130
"Yeah, it's a swastika.
That's what the country is.

875
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:15,755
Trump probably put those pepperonis
on there himself!"

876
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:16,671
[laughter]

877
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:17,880
Then, the other crew claps.

878
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:21,671
"No way. The country's way too sensitive.
PC police. Snowflakes!"

879
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,380
And what these people don't realize

880
00:37:23,463 --> 00:37:25,880
is despite believing
completely different things,

881
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:27,755
they're actually the same person.

882
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:32,338
'Cause they don't really care about
learning, and exploring, and discussing,

883
00:37:32,671 --> 00:37:35,963
they just want to chime in
with their little programmed reactions.

884
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,296
They already know what they think
about everything.

885
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:40,838
And the rest of you,
the ones that didn't clap,

886
00:37:41,213 --> 00:37:42,421
you're not off the hook.

887
00:37:42,505 --> 00:37:43,755
[laughter]

888
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,380
I saw your faces. No one was sitting there
like, "Oh, no. This poor guy.

889
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:48,505
I hope that didn't happen."

890
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:50,588
No, you were all sitting there

891
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:53,338
with the same thought
running through your head.

892
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:57,005
-"How did I miss this Pizza Hut thing?
-[laughter]

893
00:37:57,088 --> 00:37:58,671
You see the--? You see it?

894
00:37:58,755 --> 00:38:02,171
I watch so much news.
I'm watching CNN all goddamn day!

895
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:03,713
I'm on my phone the rest of the time,

896
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:06,505
I've had my shit locked up
in this stupid pouch for an hour,

897
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,046
and I'm already behind!"

898
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,296
[laughter]

899
00:38:09,963 --> 00:38:11,463
[cheering and applause]

900
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,921
By the way, you had to be
a little skeptical of this thing,

901
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:21,380
'cause, you know, if this happened,
it wouldn't have been a Pizza Hut,

902
00:38:21,463 --> 00:38:23,338
it would've happened at Papa John's.

903
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:24,755
[laughter]

904
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:26,213
[applause]

905
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:30,963
[woman] Funny!

906
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:32,338
[chuckles] Cool.

907
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:33,338
[laughs]

908
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:35,505
Some lady just yelled, "Funny!"

909
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:36,671
[laughter]

910
00:38:37,421 --> 00:38:39,463
Unnecessary, but appreciated.

911
00:38:39,546 --> 00:38:40,880
[laughter]

912
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:45,963
This is why it's cool
to come to live stuff.

913
00:38:46,046 --> 00:38:47,671
You never know
what's gonna happen, right?

914
00:38:47,755 --> 00:38:48,671
"Funny!"

915
00:38:48,755 --> 00:38:53,171
That's never happened ever
in 18 years of doing comedy.

916
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:54,546
[laughter]

917
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,546
So...

918
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,463
Ooh!

919
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:05,088
Let's talk about Alzheimer's for a minute.

920
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,380
[laughter]

921
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:09,546
My grandma has Alzheimer's.

922
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:12,463
I just saw her in India
over the Christmas holiday.

923
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:14,005
And, um, you know,

924
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:16,380
I don't know if you've got
Alzheimer's people in your life,

925
00:39:16,463 --> 00:39:18,296
but it's a very sad disease.

926
00:39:18,588 --> 00:39:21,255
Uh, she has a caretaker now.
This woman named Fatima.

927
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:25,255
And, uh, Fatima kind of explained to me
how you hang out with Alzheimer's people,

928
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:26,171
'cause, you know,

929
00:39:26,255 --> 00:39:28,713
they have all these little tics and stuff
you gotta account for.

930
00:39:28,796 --> 00:39:31,546
Like one thing my grandma would do
is she would ask the same questions

931
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,796
over and over, you know?

932
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,880
Like, one thing she kept asking,
she kept going, uh,

933
00:39:34,963 --> 00:39:37,130
"Is Aisha in there making samosas?"

934
00:39:38,171 --> 00:39:40,296
And Fatima would go,
"Yep, she's in there!"

935
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:43,880
This was very strange to me
'cause Aisha's her sister...

936
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:45,630
[whispers] that passed away.

937
00:39:46,088 --> 00:39:48,671
She's definitely not in the kitchen
making samosas.

938
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:49,671
[laughter]

939
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:51,921
And I asked Fatima, like,

940
00:39:52,005 --> 00:39:53,921
"Why are you saying that?
Why are you lying?"

941
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:57,880
She goes,
"Oh, sometimes it's easier that way."

942
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:01,755
And I was like,
"Oh. That seems kind of mean."

943
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:02,671
[laughter]

944
00:40:03,088 --> 00:40:06,255
But I was there with my girlfriend, right,
who's a Caucasian woman.

945
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,630
And every now and then,
we'd be sitting around,

946
00:40:08,713 --> 00:40:11,380
and my grandma would just go,
"Who's this white lady?"

947
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:12,421
[laughter]

948
00:40:13,588 --> 00:40:15,671
I'd go, "It's my girlfriend, Grandma."

949
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:17,005
"Does that mean it's your wife?"

950
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:18,296
"No, no, no. We're just dating.

951
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,630
Love each other very much,
might get married in the future,

952
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:22,921
but she's very important to me,
I wanted you to meet her."

953
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,255
"Oh, okay." Blah, blah, blah.

954
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,213
-"Who's this white lady?"
-[laughter]

955
00:40:26,296 --> 00:40:27,588
"It's my girlfriend, grandma."

956
00:40:27,671 --> 00:40:28,546
"Is that your wife?"

957
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,421
"No, no, We're just dating,
might get married.

958
00:40:30,505 --> 00:40:32,046
Love each other.
She's someone important.

959
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,796
Wanted you to meet her."
"Okay." Blah, blah.

960
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,213
Who's this white lady?"

961
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:37,546
Um, "The British are back, Grandma.

962
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,921
[laughter]

963
00:40:43,921 --> 00:40:46,671
And... we're gonna need
to see your papers."

964
00:40:46,755 --> 00:40:47,880
[laughter]

965
00:40:52,546 --> 00:40:53,463
[clears throat]

966
00:40:53,546 --> 00:40:56,421
The saddest thing that happened
was when my grandma goes, uh...

967
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:59,213
At one point, she kept asking me
to stay with her a little bit longer.

968
00:40:59,296 --> 00:41:01,505
She was like, "Why don't you stay here
a couple of nights,

969
00:41:01,588 --> 00:41:03,005
spend some time with your grandma?"

970
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:04,796
I was like, "Oh, I can't, Grandma.

971
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,921
I've got to head back
and get ready for my tour."

972
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:08,005
She was like, "Oh, okay.

973
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:10,005
Hey, why don't you stay here
for a couple of days,

974
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:11,463
spend some time with your grandma?"

975
00:41:11,546 --> 00:41:12,713
I was like, "I can't, Grandma.

976
00:41:12,796 --> 00:41:14,963
I gotta fly back tomorrow
and get ready for my tour."

977
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:15,880
"Oh, okay."

978
00:41:15,963 --> 00:41:18,630
She kept asking me.
I kept saying my thing.

979
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:21,213
And it was killing me because...

980
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:23,421
I knew it wasn't true.

981
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:24,921
[laughter]

982
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:25,838
I mean...

983
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:27,921
I had a flight the next day,

984
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:31,213
but I could've rearranged some things
and stayed a little longer.

985
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,838
But I'm not that good a person.

986
00:41:33,921 --> 00:41:35,088
[laughter]

987
00:41:35,171 --> 00:41:38,421
I'm one afternoon good,
I'm not two nights good.

988
00:41:38,505 --> 00:41:39,671
[laughter]

989
00:41:40,505 --> 00:41:43,963
And, uh, she asked me again,
and I was about to go into my spiel,

990
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:46,088
and then Fatima
just taps me on the shoulder,

991
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,088
and she just goes,

992
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,130
"Just tell her you're staying."

993
00:41:49,213 --> 00:41:50,546
[laughter]

994
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,755
And I was like, "Oh, man...

995
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:57,130
I'm a bad grandson, but...

996
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:01,421
you're like a demon or something.
I'm not doing that! That's mean!"

997
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:03,130
"Yeah, Grandma, I'll be here all week!

998
00:42:03,213 --> 00:42:06,630
And guess who else is here?
Aisha, bring out those samosas!"

999
00:42:06,713 --> 00:42:07,880
[laughter]

1000
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:08,963
[applause]

1001
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,421
It's hard seeing my grandma that way,
though,

1002
00:42:14,505 --> 00:42:17,630
'cause I remember her
when she was younger, you know?

1003
00:42:18,296 --> 00:42:20,796
And that's a scary thing
when you get to the age I'm at.

1004
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,880
I'm 36 now, so,

1005
00:42:21,963 --> 00:42:23,380
I've seen people get old.

1006
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:25,296
I see what old age can do to people.

1007
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,546
When you're younger
and you meet people that old,

1008
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,838
you only knew them
in the deteriorated state, right?

1009
00:42:31,046 --> 00:42:33,338
Like, if you ever met your great-grandma,

1010
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:35,963
the first time you met her,
she was like, "Aah!"

1011
00:42:36,046 --> 00:42:37,921
Uh, "Hi, Great-grandma Carol."

1012
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,255
[yelling]

1013
00:42:40,005 --> 00:42:42,213
You didn't know her
when she was jumping rope or whatever.

1014
00:42:42,296 --> 00:42:46,171
Like, you only knew her
as this Star Wars villain-type person.

1015
00:42:46,255 --> 00:42:47,380
[laughter]

1016
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:51,671
But now, you see that change.

1017
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,421
It's very scary.

1018
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:57,588
'Cause you realize
that's coming for us all, right?

1019
00:42:58,171 --> 00:42:59,463
It's coming for us.

1020
00:43:00,255 --> 00:43:01,796
It's coming for our parents.

1021
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,046
[whispers]
That's when it gets scary, right?

1022
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:07,130
You start thinking about your folks.

1023
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:08,796
I'm very lucky,

1024
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,463
both of my parents
are still alive and well,

1025
00:43:11,546 --> 00:43:12,880
still have it all up here.

1026
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:16,421
And I completely take it for granted.

1027
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:19,963
I don't call 'em enough.
I don't see 'em enough.

1028
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:22,838
You see your folks enough?

1029
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:26,880
How often you see them?
What, two or three times a year?

1030
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,088
What have they got left?

1031
00:43:29,963 --> 00:43:30,963
Maybe 20 years?

1032
00:43:32,046 --> 00:43:32,921
That's...

1033
00:43:33,421 --> 00:43:35,838
60 more times you get to see 'em.

1034
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:37,963
That's it.

1035
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:40,255
Sixty more times.

1036
00:43:41,296 --> 00:43:42,796
Sixty more hangs.

1037
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:46,380
Are you making the most of these hangs?

1038
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,421
Are you creating cherished memories?

1039
00:43:51,213 --> 00:43:53,505
You know what? Everyone just
close your eyes for a second.

1040
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,421
Close your eyes for a second.
Close your eyes.

1041
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,213
Come on, man. Let's close 'em.
You're the only one.

1042
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:02,880
[laughter]

1043
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,213
Just think back to that last weekend
you saw your parents, right?

1044
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:10,546
Think about everything you did.

1045
00:44:13,588 --> 00:44:15,671
Hone in on your most cherished memory.

1046
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:20,880
And when you've got your memory,
just raise your hand.

1047
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,046
There's, like, five hands right now.

1048
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:28,088
[laughter]

1049
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:31,838
You know why? 'Cause we all had
the same shitty weekend, okay?

1050
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,921
I know what you did,
'cause I did the same thing.

1051
00:44:35,213 --> 00:44:36,546
You show up late on a Friday like,

1052
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,880
"All right, well, I better unpack my stuff
and get to bed."

1053
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:41,796
"All right, we'll see you in the morning."
Day one done.

1054
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,171
[laughter]

1055
00:44:44,171 --> 00:44:48,588
Then, you wake up early the next day
at like... 11:30.

1056
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,005
[laughter]

1057
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:52,921
go in the kitchen, making coffee.
"Oh, you guys got a new coffee machine."

1058
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:54,505
"Yeah, we like it."

1059
00:44:54,588 --> 00:44:55,463
[laughter]

1060
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:57,421
Conversation done.

1061
00:44:57,505 --> 00:44:58,838
[laughter]

1062
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:02,588
The rest of the day,
everyone's on their phones, computers,

1063
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:04,463
doing whatever they can
to avoid eye contact

1064
00:45:04,546 --> 00:45:06,213
or any kind of deep conversation.

1065
00:45:06,546 --> 00:45:09,171
At a certain point,
collective guilt sets in.

1066
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:11,505
The entire family convenes
in the living room.

1067
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:13,880
No one knows what the fuck to say.

1068
00:45:13,963 --> 00:45:15,046
[laughter]

1069
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,005
Then, at some point, for some reason,

1070
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:20,296
you and your entire family
watch the film Speed together.

1071
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,755
[laughter]

1072
00:45:22,838 --> 00:45:24,213
And then, it's dinner time.

1073
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:28,463
One of your parents is like, "Hey, let's
go to any restaurant you like. You pick."

1074
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:31,171
And you're like, "I don't live
in this shitty town. You pick!"

1075
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:33,796
And they're like, "Let's go
to that restaurant we like

1076
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:36,338
and don't realize is actually a chain!"

1077
00:45:36,671 --> 00:45:39,963
You show up, you order jalapeno poppers
and the fried onion thing.

1078
00:45:40,046 --> 00:45:41,338
You eat all the stuff, come home,

1079
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:43,588
you take the biggest shit
you've had in months.

1080
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:44,505
[laughter]

1081
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:47,088
Wake up the next morning,
pack your stuff up,

1082
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:48,380
wheeling it out.

1083
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:49,630
Just as you're leaving,

1084
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,921
one of your parents
finally looks you in the eyes.

1085
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:54,671
And they're like, uh,

1086
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,963
"Is your life okay?"

1087
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:58,088
[laughter]

1088
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:00,005
And it never is.

1089
00:46:00,088 --> 00:46:01,380
[laughter]

1090
00:46:01,463 --> 00:46:03,296
But you're just like, "Yeah!"

1091
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,421
[laughter]

1092
00:46:04,505 --> 00:46:06,630
'Cause we're completely incapable

1093
00:46:07,088 --> 00:46:08,880
of having a real conversation

1094
00:46:09,296 --> 00:46:13,046
with these people we've known
our entire lives.

1095
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:15,796
We do this whole song and dance

1096
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:18,088
59 more times...

1097
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:19,380
[laughter]

1098
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:24,296
And then they're dead.

1099
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,463
[laughter]

1100
00:46:30,046 --> 00:46:32,130
What if I ended the show right there?

1101
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:33,380
[laughter]

1102
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:40,046
By the way, poor Tyler.
None of this applies to you, dude.

1103
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,213
[laughter]

1104
00:46:41,713 --> 00:46:44,671
He's sitting there like,
"My dad's gonna die in 20 years!"

1105
00:46:44,755 --> 00:46:45,713
[laughter]

1106
00:46:48,713 --> 00:46:50,921
You're all good, man.
You're with your dad right now.

1107
00:46:51,005 --> 00:46:52,046
It's all good.

1108
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,380
[laughs] He's gonna go home
and just hug his mom,

1109
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:57,046
"Mom, the man said
you're gonna die in 20 years!"

1110
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:58,713
[laughter]

1111
00:47:01,755 --> 00:47:04,588
I'm not saying all this stuff
to make us sad, okay?

1112
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:06,963
I'm saying it to hopefully inspire us

1113
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:09,755
to talk to these people,
get to know 'em, right?

1114
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,338
'Cause when they pass, we're the ones
that tell their story, okay?

1115
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:14,838
You know, we're their biographers.

1116
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:18,630
And I'm sure they're way more interesting
than we give 'em credit for.

1117
00:47:18,713 --> 00:47:20,921
So, next time we're home,
I challenge us all,

1118
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,963
sit down with these people, talk to 'em.

1119
00:47:23,046 --> 00:47:25,213
You know? Sit down with your mom
and say, "You know what?

1120
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:26,713
Put away the phones and everything.

1121
00:47:26,796 --> 00:47:28,880
I want to talk to you.
I want to learn about your life.

1122
00:47:28,963 --> 00:47:30,713
Tell me your story."
And she'll be touched.

1123
00:47:30,796 --> 00:47:34,046
You look her in the eye
and you ask her stuff. You go big.

1124
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:36,005
Say, "So, Mom...

1125
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,213
You ever fuck a black guy?

1126
00:47:39,296 --> 00:47:40,630
[laughter]

1127
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:44,588
[gasps]

1128
00:47:44,671 --> 00:47:46,796
"Why would you ask me
something like that?"

1129
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,005
[laughter]

1130
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,880
"I'm just trying to learn about your life,
I don't know. I just want to know things."

1131
00:47:51,963 --> 00:47:54,463
"Well, that seems
like a very strange place to start!

1132
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:56,505
"I don't know. I'm trying."

1133
00:47:56,963 --> 00:47:57,796
[scoffs]

1134
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:03,005
All right, it was '98,
and the Bulls were in their prime.

1135
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,088
[laughter]

1136
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:05,505
[applause]

1137
00:48:09,921 --> 00:48:12,421
Um... Tyler, you can do that part
if you want.

1138
00:48:12,505 --> 00:48:13,880
[laughter]

1139
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:15,755
[Aziz laughs]

1140
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:22,171
Tyler, promise me you'll do that.

1141
00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:23,880
-[laughter]
-Will you do it?

1142
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:26,421
Will you do it? Will you do it?
Will you do it?

1143
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:27,921
Yes!

1144
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,421
[cheering and applause]

1145
00:48:30,505 --> 00:48:31,921
[Aziz laughs]

1146
00:48:33,338 --> 00:48:34,921
Mmm...

1147
00:48:36,171 --> 00:48:37,046
Uh...

1148
00:48:38,005 --> 00:48:40,088
I, uh... I'm in a relationship right now.

1149
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,713
-[cheering]
-Yeah, a very wonderful woman.

1150
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:44,463
Uh, we're an interracial couple.

1151
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,713
You know, most people
don't care about that. But, uh...

1152
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:49,546
some people don't like it!

1153
00:48:50,088 --> 00:48:52,380
We kind of get it on two fronts nowadays,
you know?

1154
00:48:52,463 --> 00:48:55,505
One front, we get kind of old-school,
classic stuff, you know?

1155
00:48:55,588 --> 00:48:57,296
Like, "Y'all don't match!"

1156
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,588
[laughter]

1157
00:48:58,671 --> 00:49:02,088
And you also get kind of new school stuff,
like, "Aziz, you're in entertainment,

1158
00:49:02,171 --> 00:49:04,130
you shouldn't be dating
outside your ethnicity,

1159
00:49:04,213 --> 00:49:05,213
especially a white person,

1160
00:49:05,296 --> 00:49:09,296
'cause that propagates ideas
of white beauty being put on a pedestal!"

1161
00:49:09,463 --> 00:49:12,296
Which is just a fancy way of saying,
"Y'all don't match!"

1162
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,588
[laughter]

1163
00:49:14,046 --> 00:49:17,171
'Cause, look, man, I understand.
I get the argument, okay?

1164
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:20,338
But I've dated Indian people.
I've dated people of many ethnicities.

1165
00:49:20,421 --> 00:49:22,755
But this is the person
I have a deep connection with.

1166
00:49:22,838 --> 00:49:24,171
That's very hard to find.

1167
00:49:24,338 --> 00:49:27,005
And I'm sorry
we're not the same skin tone.

1168
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:28,213
But I'm also kind of tired

1169
00:49:28,296 --> 00:49:31,213
of people telling me
what race person I'm allowed to date.

1170
00:49:31,296 --> 00:49:33,421
This has happened my entire life,
you know?

1171
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:34,671
Even when I was a little kid.

1172
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:38,213
I remember being in first grade,
every single kid in the class was white,

1173
00:49:38,296 --> 00:49:40,505
except for me and this little Asian girl.

1174
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:42,630
And even back then,
people used to be like,

1175
00:49:43,255 --> 00:49:46,046
-"All right, Aziz!
-[laughter]

1176
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:49,005
What's going on with you
and Christine Li, man?

1177
00:49:49,088 --> 00:49:52,255
I see you two. What's going on over there?

1178
00:49:52,338 --> 00:49:56,463
Come on, man. You look weird.
She looks weird...

1179
00:49:56,546 --> 00:49:57,713
[laughter]

1180
00:49:57,796 --> 00:49:59,255
Let's do this!"

1181
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:02,588
Then 20-odd years later,
I get into show business,

1182
00:50:02,671 --> 00:50:04,046
it's the same thing, right?

1183
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:05,421
"All right, Aziz,

1184
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:07,505
you're an Indian comedy actor...

1185
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,463
[clears throat]

1186
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:13,255
Mindy Kaling's an Indian comedy actor.
What's going on-yam-yam-yam-yam?"

1187
00:50:13,713 --> 00:50:14,880
[laughter]

1188
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:17,505
Uh...

1189
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,796
You know, uh, my girlfriend, she's Danish,

1190
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,713
so she doesn't even understand
some of the racism we deal with sometimes.

1191
00:50:25,796 --> 00:50:28,921
'Cause, you know, they don't have
the same kind of racism in Denmark.

1192
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:32,796
Just culturally, it's different,
'cause they don't have any other races.

1193
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,755
[laughter]

1194
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:34,963
Just Danish people,

1195
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:38,046
and the closest thing they've got
to minorities is rye bread.

1196
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,380
[laughter]

1197
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:42,296
So sometimes, I've got to explain stuff
to her, you know?

1198
00:50:42,671 --> 00:50:44,796
And, okay, I'm gonna do her voice
for this next bit.

1199
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,171
This is not her voice, okay?

1200
00:50:46,255 --> 00:50:47,671
Her... her accent's a little tricky,

1201
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:49,921
'cause she's lived
in a few different parts of the world,

1202
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,338
so, I'm just saying that
'cause I don't want to do this voice

1203
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:56,713
and people be like, "Whoa, Aziz is dating
some Mary Poppins-sounding motherfucker."

1204
00:50:56,796 --> 00:50:57,630
[laughter]

1205
00:50:57,713 --> 00:50:59,505
Anyway, she comes up to me one day,
she goes,

1206
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,505
"Darling, I did something a bit naughty.

1207
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:04,963
Um, I went on some internet forums

1208
00:51:05,046 --> 00:51:07,755
and I saw people have been posting
paparazzi photos of us.

1209
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:09,296
And I'm just wondering,

1210
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,588
why do these people think
that my name is Becky?"

1211
00:51:13,005 --> 00:51:13,963
[laughter]

1212
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:20,046
And I had to explain to her,
"No one thinks your name's Becky.

1213
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:22,796
That's just internet slang
making fun of white girls.

1214
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,005
Like the Beyoncé song,
"Go call Becky with the good hair."

1215
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,088
"Oh... so it's kind of like a slur?

1216
00:51:29,713 --> 00:51:32,671
Not that bad really,
just calling me a different name."

1217
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,421
And then she opened up her umbrella
and flew into the sky.

1218
00:51:35,505 --> 00:51:37,005
[laughter]

1219
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:38,296
[applause]

1220
00:51:39,255 --> 00:51:40,713
One time... [laughs]

1221
00:51:40,796 --> 00:51:42,796
we were walking around in New York,
right?

1222
00:51:43,171 --> 00:51:45,296
And we're just holding hands,
minding our business.

1223
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,421
Dude just points at us, and he goes,

1224
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:50,171
"Bet you get a lot of free taxi rides
with that one!"

1225
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:51,171
[audience] Oh!

1226
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:53,463
Before I could even say anything,
my girlfriend just goes,

1227
00:51:53,546 --> 00:51:57,796
"Excuse me, sir. I pay for my fair share
of the taxis, thank you very much!"

1228
00:51:58,130 --> 00:51:59,255
[laughter]

1229
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:03,005
And then just started strutting
like she'd dominated the interaction.

1230
00:52:03,088 --> 00:52:04,088
[laughter]

1231
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:09,546
And... I didn't even get a chance
to get angry at this guy

1232
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,630
'cause I was so confused.

1233
00:52:11,713 --> 00:52:12,963
[laughter]

1234
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,630
And I was eventually like,
"Why did you say that?"

1235
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:18,380
She goes,
"Well, this gentleman is clearly implying

1236
00:52:18,463 --> 00:52:22,213
that I'm dating you for your wealth
and that I am some kind of gold digger."

1237
00:52:22,296 --> 00:52:23,671
[laughter]

1238
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:26,213
[laughter]

1239
00:52:26,296 --> 00:52:27,338
[applause]

1240
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,755
"That's what you think just happened?

1241
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:31,796
[laughter]

1242
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,755
No.

1243
00:52:33,463 --> 00:52:36,505
He's making fun of me 'cause I'm Indian.
He's saying that I drive a taxi."

1244
00:52:37,005 --> 00:52:40,463
"Hm, well, you don't drive a taxi. Ha-ha!"

1245
00:52:40,546 --> 00:52:41,838
[laughter]

1246
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:43,421
"No, he knows that.

1247
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:44,880
[laughter]

1248
00:52:44,963 --> 00:52:46,338
He's just saying that...

1249
00:52:47,046 --> 00:52:49,380
a lot of times you get in a cab,
it's a brown guy.

1250
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:52,046
It's a stereotype.
It's a job Indian people have a lot."

1251
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:54,213
"Mmm, well, a lot of Indian people
are doctors as well.

1252
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:57,338
He could've said, 'Oh, bet you get a lot
of free check-ups with that one."

1253
00:52:57,421 --> 00:52:58,380
[laughter]

1254
00:53:00,796 --> 00:53:01,630
Uh...

1255
00:53:02,671 --> 00:53:06,171
"I guess technically, yes, but...
why the fuck would he say that?

1256
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:09,213
That's not... not really
what he's going for here, okay?

1257
00:53:09,296 --> 00:53:11,130
He's trying to be demeaning, okay?

1258
00:53:11,213 --> 00:53:14,838
He's not trying to make fun of me
for potentially being a doctor. Uh...

1259
00:53:14,921 --> 00:53:15,838
[laughter]

1260
00:53:17,005 --> 00:53:20,796
He's just saying, often you get in a cab,
it's a brown guy and he's Indian, okay?"

1261
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,380
"Hm, well, someone send him a memo,

1262
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:24,880
'cause just 'cause someone's brown
doesn't mean they're Indian.

1263
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:27,296
They could also be Pakistani,
Bangladeshi, and many other--"

1264
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:29,046
[yells] "Yeah, he knows all this!

1265
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:30,380
[laughter]

1266
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:33,255
Goddammit, Becky,
this is what racism is."

1267
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:34,421
[laughter]

1268
00:53:34,505 --> 00:53:35,671
[applause]

1269
00:53:38,796 --> 00:53:41,338
For birth control stuff, my girlfriend,

1270
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:42,963
uh, she has an IUD.

1271
00:53:43,546 --> 00:53:44,380
[cheering]

1272
00:53:44,463 --> 00:53:46,255
Got some fans in the house!

1273
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:47,505
[laughs]

1274
00:53:47,588 --> 00:53:50,005
"Whoo, I have one in my pussy, as well!"

1275
00:53:50,088 --> 00:53:51,130
[laughter]

1276
00:53:52,213 --> 00:53:53,963
[laughing]

1277
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:56,088
Two people that are sitting
pretty close together.

1278
00:53:56,171 --> 00:53:57,713
There's a little cluster.

1279
00:53:57,796 --> 00:53:59,088
[laughter]

1280
00:54:00,463 --> 00:54:02,421
But, you know, my girlfriend has one,

1281
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:05,713
and she's very surprised that more people
in America don't have the IUDs,

1282
00:54:05,796 --> 00:54:07,963
'cause they're very popular in Europe.
Here, not as much.

1283
00:54:08,046 --> 00:54:09,838
Here, people are more into the pills.

1284
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,588
If you think about it,
I get her confusion,

1285
00:54:11,671 --> 00:54:14,421
'cause the pills really are
a crazy product, right?

1286
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:17,505
Pills are like you and your partner,
Lisa and David,

1287
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:19,213
go to the doctor, you're like, "Uh...

1288
00:54:19,296 --> 00:54:23,171
Yes, um, we're worried about pregnancy
but we don't want to use condoms.

1289
00:54:23,255 --> 00:54:24,713
Is there anything we can do?"

1290
00:54:25,046 --> 00:54:27,713
The doctor's like,
"Yes. I've got the perfect plan.

1291
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:30,421
Lisa, I'm gonna give you this pill.

1292
00:54:31,171 --> 00:54:32,421
This pill, uh...

1293
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:34,421
-this pill's gonna fuck you up.
-[laughter]

1294
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:37,130
It's gonna put a bunch of hormones
in your body, it's gonna be weird,

1295
00:54:37,213 --> 00:54:39,880
but I need you to take the pill every day
at the same time, okay?

1296
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:41,505
Every day, same time.

1297
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:45,088
Don't forget. You forget even once,
you'll get pregnant today, okay?

1298
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:47,546
Every day, same time.

1299
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:49,630
Don't fuck this up, Lisa!

1300
00:54:49,713 --> 00:54:50,755
[laughter]

1301
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:52,921
All right, David,
this is what you're gonna have to do.

1302
00:54:53,005 --> 00:54:56,713
Nothing. I got you, dog, just go ahead.
Drop it in. Have a good time.

1303
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:00,046
I don't even know why you came
to the appointment. You're adorable."

1304
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,255
[laughter]

1305
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:04,921
Now, the way the IUD thing works...

1306
00:55:06,046 --> 00:55:08,463
The way the IUD thing works is

1307
00:55:08,546 --> 00:55:11,713
there's this little copper guy,
and the doctor puts it in there very deep

1308
00:55:11,796 --> 00:55:13,213
in a very painful procedure.

1309
00:55:13,296 --> 00:55:14,880
And it's got these strings on the outside

1310
00:55:14,963 --> 00:55:17,963
so the doctor can take it out
if you decide you want to have kids,

1311
00:55:18,046 --> 00:55:20,755
or I guess after, like, seven years,
it has to be replaced.

1312
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:23,630
And, uh, one time, we're doing stuff,

1313
00:55:23,963 --> 00:55:25,296
and I hit the string...

1314
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:27,588
-[whispers] with my penis.
-[laughter]

1315
00:55:27,671 --> 00:55:28,838
And...

1316
00:55:29,463 --> 00:55:30,880
it hurt very badly.

1317
00:55:31,588 --> 00:55:32,671
And, oh, man...

1318
00:55:33,338 --> 00:55:36,380
It's hard to go back in there
with that same level of enthusiasm...

1319
00:55:36,463 --> 00:55:37,921
[laughter]

1320
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:39,671
after an attack.

1321
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,005
I'm trying to think of an analogy.
It's like...

1322
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,171
Uh, let's say
you're eating a bag of chips, right?

1323
00:55:45,255 --> 00:55:48,046
And... everything's fine, right?
You're having the chips...

1324
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:49,505
"Meh, eh, eh, eh."

1325
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:51,338
And then one time, you reach for a chip

1326
00:55:51,421 --> 00:55:54,130
and... something bites your dick, right?

1327
00:55:54,213 --> 00:55:55,630
[laughter]

1328
00:55:55,713 --> 00:55:59,463
And the next time you reach for the chips,
you're not gonna be like, "Eh..."

1329
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:02,046
You're gonna be like,
"Oh, hold on, don't move the bag.

1330
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:04,171
I'm coming in. Don't move the bag!"

1331
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:05,505
It's different.

1332
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:07,171
[laughter]

1333
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:10,921
So, this eventually becomes a problem,
right?

1334
00:56:11,296 --> 00:56:13,505
And... my girlfriend's like,
"We gotta do something.

1335
00:56:13,588 --> 00:56:16,296
I don't like this.
Maybe I should go back on the pills."

1336
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,130
"Hey, whatever you want to do
is fine with me.

1337
00:56:18,213 --> 00:56:20,463
It doesn't really feel like my place
to say, you know?"

1338
00:56:20,546 --> 00:56:23,046
And she's like, "Yeah, I know,
but I don't really like the pills."

1339
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,130
I'm like, "Why not?"

1340
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:26,588
She goes, "Ah, you know.
You get very cranky,

1341
00:56:26,671 --> 00:56:28,296
very moody, irritable.

1342
00:56:29,338 --> 00:56:30,713
But I guess I could do it."

1343
00:56:32,463 --> 00:56:33,588
And I was like, "What?

1344
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:35,046
[laughter]

1345
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:37,630
These are the two options?

1346
00:56:37,713 --> 00:56:39,005
[laughter]

1347
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,255
Either I risk penal bruising,

1348
00:56:43,255 --> 00:56:47,463
or you just resign yourself
to becoming this shittier person?

1349
00:56:47,546 --> 00:56:48,588
[laughter]

1350
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,380
There's got to be another way."

1351
00:56:51,463 --> 00:56:52,463
Sure enough...

1352
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:58,296
she goes to the doctor, finds out
there's this brand new male IUD...

1353
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:00,588
And I got one put in.

1354
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,088
And now we're all good.

1355
00:57:03,046 --> 00:57:03,880
Yeah.

1356
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,255
So, the way this thing works--

1357
00:57:06,338 --> 00:57:08,088
There is no male IUD!

1358
00:57:08,171 --> 00:57:10,546
-[laughter]
-Look how excited people got!

1359
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,546
This lady in the front
just pulled out her phone,

1360
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:14,880
"I'm calling to make an appointment
for my boyfriend.

1361
00:57:14,963 --> 00:57:15,838
[laughter]

1362
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:17,755
What time do you open?
Uh, eight o'clock?

1363
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:19,296
Yeah, he'll be there at 7:15.

1364
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,630
[laughter]

1365
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:22,588
Let's go ahead
and put two of those guys in there

1366
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:24,796
in case one of them breaks down,
and, uh...

1367
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,338
Please, tuck those strings in nicely,
I don't want anything poking my pussy.

1368
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,713
Uh, his name? Uh, it's Dan Greenblatt.
That's right."

1369
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:32,838
[laughter]

1370
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:33,963
[applause]

1371
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:38,546
Oh...

1372
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,713
Dan, glad you came out tonight.

1373
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:44,380
[laughter]

1374
00:57:44,713 --> 00:57:46,421
I'm glad you all came out tonight.

1375
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:48,421
-[cheering]
-And... yeah.

1376
00:57:48,505 --> 00:57:50,005
[cheering and applause]

1377
00:57:54,921 --> 00:57:55,963
I really mean that.

1378
00:57:56,505 --> 00:57:58,713
I really am very grateful you came,
you know?

1379
00:57:58,796 --> 00:58:01,671
'Cause, you know,
I've done a lot of shows in my career.

1380
00:58:01,755 --> 00:58:03,755
At the end of the shows,
I'd always go,

1381
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:05,588
"Good night. Thank you very much!"

1382
00:58:06,338 --> 00:58:07,463
But the truth is,

1383
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:09,505
I never really meant it.

1384
00:58:09,588 --> 00:58:11,296
[laughter]

1385
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:15,588
I was just saying that 'cause it's what
you say at the end of a show, right?

1386
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,588
I mean, sure, I was grateful.
I'm not a dick.

1387
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:21,338
But... I wasn't grateful enough.

1388
00:58:22,046 --> 00:58:25,546
I didn't really think about what it means
that all you guys came out.

1389
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:29,088
But now, when I see you guys here,
it hits me in a different way.

1390
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:32,796
I think about what it means
that all you guys,

1391
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:34,380
you drove down here,

1392
00:58:34,838 --> 00:58:36,005
you waited in line.

1393
00:58:36,505 --> 00:58:38,005
And you did all of this stuff

1394
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,796
just to hear me talk into a microphone

1395
00:58:42,338 --> 00:58:43,588
for, like, an hour or so.

1396
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,671
And it means the world to me,

1397
00:58:47,338 --> 00:58:48,213
'cause...

1398
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:50,088
I saw the world...

1399
00:58:51,671 --> 00:58:53,921
where I don't ever get to do this again.

1400
00:58:56,088 --> 00:58:56,921
And...

1401
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:00,963
it almost felt like I'd died.

1402
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:04,046
In a way...

1403
00:59:04,963 --> 00:59:05,796
I did.

1404
00:59:08,046 --> 00:59:12,088
That old Aziz who said,
"Oh, treat yo' self," whatever, he's dead.

1405
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,005
[laughter]

1406
00:59:14,671 --> 00:59:15,630
But I'm glad...

1407
00:59:17,505 --> 00:59:18,421
'cause that guy...

1408
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:21,046
was always looking forward...

1409
00:59:21,755 --> 00:59:23,005
to whatever was next.

1410
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:25,130
"Oh, am I gonna do another tour?

1411
00:59:25,213 --> 00:59:27,588
Am I gonna do another season of the show?"
Blah, blah, blah.

1412
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,255
I don't think that way anymore.

1413
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:34,338
'Cause I've realized...

1414
00:59:36,671 --> 00:59:37,713
it's all ephemeral.

1415
00:59:39,255 --> 00:59:40,255
All that stuff...

1416
00:59:41,963 --> 00:59:43,130
it can just go away...

1417
00:59:44,171 --> 00:59:45,588
like this... [snaps fingers]

1418
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:49,338
And all we really have...

1419
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:52,130
is the moment we're in...

1420
00:59:53,213 --> 00:59:54,671
and the people we're with.

1421
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:59,005
Now, I talked about my grandma earlier,
and it was sad.

1422
00:59:59,713 --> 01:00:02,671
But what I didn't tell you was
the whole time when I was with her,

1423
01:00:02,755 --> 01:00:06,838
she was smiling, she was laughing,
she was there with me.

1424
01:00:07,088 --> 01:00:08,463
She was present in a way

1425
01:00:08,796 --> 01:00:12,171
no other people I've been around recently
have been.

1426
01:00:12,838 --> 01:00:14,463
I've tried to take that with me.

1427
01:00:15,588 --> 01:00:17,005
And Granny, my grandma,

1428
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:20,005
doesn't have much choice in this matter.

1429
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:21,921
But I do.

1430
01:00:22,505 --> 01:00:24,588
And that's how I choose to live,

1431
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,963
in the moment I'm in
with the people I'm with.

1432
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:31,546
And right now, this is our moment, right?

1433
01:00:32,505 --> 01:00:35,630
Me, you guys, Dan...

1434
01:00:35,713 --> 01:00:37,755
[laughter]

1435
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,255
Random lady that yelled, "Funny!"

1436
01:00:40,338 --> 01:00:42,046

[laughter]

1439
01:00:49,505 --> 01:00:50,588
It's all of us.

1440
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:53,713
And this is our moment right now.
So, you know what?

1441
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,005
Why don't we all just take it in
for just a second?

1442
01:01:06,338 --> 01:01:07,255
An on that,

1443
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:09,213
I'll say good night,

1444
01:01:09,421 --> 01:01:11,213
and thank you very, very much.

1445
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:12,713
