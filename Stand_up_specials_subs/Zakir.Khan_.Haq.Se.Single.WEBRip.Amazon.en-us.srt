1
00:00:02,196 --> 00:00:03,699
Unabashedly Single!

2
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:19,697
Ladies and gentlemen,

3
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,520
Zakir Khan.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,731
His eyes keep roving

5
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:23,779
Drinking like a bawse!

6
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:24,893
He got two straws!

7
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:26,071
In his one glass

8
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,109
No one's ahead

9
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,352
Nobody's behind

10
00:00:28,432 --> 00:00:29,552
All of us are single

11
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:30,147
With Pride

12
00:00:30,227 --> 00:00:30,709
Unabashed!

13
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:31,769
I'm my own king

14
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:32,882
and I'm my own

15
00:00:32,962 --> 00:00:33,844
I never let anyone

16
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:34,958
Do just what they want

17
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:36,298
No one's ahead of us

18
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:37,520
Nobody's behind

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,752
All of us are single

20
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:39,336
With Pride

21
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:40,179
Unabashed!

22
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,445
Please sit, sit.

23
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,506
Thank you.

24
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:58,698
Thank you very much, guys.

25
00:00:58,778 --> 00:00:59,908
Thanks a lot,

26
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:01,085
'Haq Se' section.

27
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,407
I hope no one's got their
kids here by mistake.

28
00:01:08,747 --> 00:01:10,909
I'll say my bit and go,
I've got nothing to lose.

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,234
Unnecessarily your child 
will mature beyond years.

30
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,120
You know, as a kid,
you don't understand everything.

31
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:28,837
There are a lot of things
that you record in your mind

32
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,137
but only understand
it when you're older.

33
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:33,231
Right? Right?

34
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,175
For instance,
it was my father's birthday,

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,723
and an lady came over.

36
00:01:44,949 --> 00:01:46,756
She brought flowers for dad

37
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,584
and chocolates for me.

38
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,510
Everything was nice, she pulled
my cheeks and made me sit on her lap.

39
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,210
Basically, the men of the
house were happy with her.

40
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,925
It was all going fine.

41
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:08,610
But I don't know... Why my
mother had a problem with her.

42
00:02:09,873 --> 00:02:10,824
Mummy got angry.

43
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:13,774
She started fidgeting, fixing things
and went into the kitchen.

44
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:16,066
I went after her saying,
"Mummy, mummy, mummy."

45
00:02:16,342 --> 00:02:18,081
I must have been four and a half,
five years old maybe.

46
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:19,836
I was behind her going,
"Mummy, mummy, mummy..."

47
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:20,779
She turned around and said,
"Why are you following me?

48
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:22,448
Go and ask who'll have tea!"

49
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:25,675
I went out and asked my dad,
"Dad will you have tea?"

50
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,006
My dad said yes.

51
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:28,295
While asking the lady, I blurted,

52
00:02:28,494 --> 00:02:30,103
"MUMMY will you have tea?"

53
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:35,586
There was an awkward silence.

54
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:38,976
The lady blushed.

55
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:41,943
Dad smiled, nervously.

56
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:47,001
You're getting it, right?

57
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:47,873
The lady was like...

58
00:02:47,953 --> 00:02:48,869
And dad...

59
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,015
This is where mummy comes in.

60
00:02:54,095 --> 00:02:56,013
She brings her 'A' game.

61
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:58,487
My mother is a boss politician.

62
00:02:59,204 --> 00:03:00,966
She yelled, "Shameless,
you have no sense!

63
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,802
Apologise to your aunt."

64
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,293
The lady also brushed it off.

65
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:10,975
She said, "It's okay, he's just a kid."

66
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:14,270
Then she picked me up,
took me outside the room and said,

67
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,307
"Son..."

68
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:16,933
Very sweetly she said,

69
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,081
"Son, it's just that
I didn't say yes in time,

70
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,511
or you'd be calling me 'Mummy'."

71
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,144
She said this and let me off.

72
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:28,076
I didn't get it then.

73
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:30,610
But now when I think of it...

74
00:03:31,328 --> 00:03:33,741
I feel an increasing sense
of respect for my father.

75
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,413
No matter what he does,

76
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:43,939
my dad is a total stud!

77
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,444
Anyway, as you grow up, you go ahead,

78
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:53,859
change cities and learn new things...

79
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:58,062
But I feel, a guy truly learns
when he has a girl in his life.

80
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:01,530
I mean only a girl can
help evolve a guy's personality,

81
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,416
guys don't help in this matter.

82
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:06,745
Because a person pushes
his limit, in love.

83
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,527
Yes...

84
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,364
One day my friend asked,
"Do you want to eat sushi?"

85
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:13,863
I said, "Get lost!
I'm not eating uncooked fish!"

86
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,174
This was when I used to
chat with a girl.

87
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,148
You know those girls who are
good at everything. Life is sorted.

88
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,609
Good at studying,
theatre-society regulars,

89
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:30,503
knows how to sing,

90
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,432
knows how to cook,

91
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:32,342
knows how to embroider

92
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:33,273
AND,

93
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,338
she's also daddy's little angel!

94
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,793
Now I couldn't believe
that such a happy girl exists.

95
00:04:45,692 --> 00:04:47,228
So I decided to stay vigilant.

96
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:51,026
Because this was during
the 'Angel Priya' time

97
00:04:51,636 --> 00:04:53,407
where one couldn't gauge
if it was fake or real.

98
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,601
Secondly, a beautiful and happy girl,

99
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:56,850
is talking to me?

100
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,310
I mean...

101
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:02,612
One day she asked me,
"Hey...uh... let's meet.

102
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,813
Let's catch up."

103
00:05:03,893 --> 00:05:04,782
I said, "Where?"

104
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:06,117
She said, "Sushi restaurant."

105
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,012
Now I've never seen sushi.

106
00:05:09,027 --> 00:05:11,098
Haven't been to a restaurant
or eaten it either.

107
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,512
In fact, I just refused my friend
this morning.

108
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,878
I was thinking what to do.

109
00:05:16,238 --> 00:05:19,012
Should I say no?
What should I tell her?

110
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:20,116
How should I tell her?

111
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,610
Five minutes passed by...

112
00:05:23,772 --> 00:05:25,333
And she sent me another text.

113
00:05:26,014 --> 00:05:27,237
'You know sushi, right?

114
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:31,937
You comfortable with it.
You know what it is?'

115
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:34,067
Okay.

116
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,133
Do you guys know what an atom is?

117
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:39,429
It's the smallest unit...

118
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,820
Inside it there are three particles.

119
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,020
Protons, Electrons and Neutrons.

120
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,712
Electrons, the lightest particle!

121
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,389
Now, if you cut that up in four.

122
00:05:49,205 --> 00:05:51,191
The one-fourth piece of that Electron...

123
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,101
That's how big the male ego is.

124
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,077
And with that question
she hurt my male ego.

125
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,492
I said, "Just a minute.

126
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:10,025
Did I ever tell you about my passion?"

127
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:13,021
She said, "No..."

128
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:16,100
I laughed,
"Oh, hahahaha!"

129
00:06:16,506 --> 00:06:18,495
"Hahahaha!"

130
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:22,895
I used to be a writer then.
I said, "Writing's my profession."

131
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,223
She said, "Okay and passion?"

132
00:06:24,303 --> 00:06:25,247
I said, "Sushi."

133
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:28,172
She asked, "So when do we meet?"

134
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:29,468
I said, "Today and right away."

135
00:06:30,465 --> 00:06:31,904
Now, your brother is a warrior.

136
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:33,910
He accepts every challenge.

137
00:06:34,657 --> 00:06:36,242
I said, alright.
Let's go to the restaurant.

138
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,619
Look, I was being vigilant.

139
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:40,130
I entered the restaurant from this gate.

140
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,258
She entered from the other one.

141
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,528
I saw her, she matched her photo.

142
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,148
Those were the days, without filters.

143
00:06:52,711 --> 00:06:54,285
She saw me,

144
00:06:55,011 --> 00:06:56,836
recognised me,

145
00:06:57,329 --> 00:06:58,696
and was suddenly possessed.

146
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:03,382
She shouted from afar,

147
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:05,069
"HIII!"

148
00:07:05,328 --> 00:07:06,777
I was like, what the hell just happened.

149
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:12,453
Just then the waiter arrived,
"Sir, may I help you, sir?

150
00:07:13,274 --> 00:07:16,409
Sir, may I help you, sir?"

151
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:17,923
I told him, not me her.

152
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:21,468
Get her a seat,
give her some water,

153
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,766
maybe sprinkle some
cold water on her as well.

154
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:28,128
Also I don't get the useless
questions that the waiters ask,

155
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,674
"Sir, table for two, sir?"

156
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,010
I said, "Come here.

157
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,264
Can't you see the lust in my eyes?!"

158
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:40,983
Finally we sat.

159
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:43,319
Both of us.

160
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:45,144
The restaurant had gone
all out Japanese.

161
00:07:45,224 --> 00:07:46,163
Sushi...

162
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:50,163
They had put up dragons, boss.

163
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:53,331
I too was in full form,
a complete charmer.

164
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:57,126
I was, "Oh, you know,
like, hahahaha..."

165
00:07:57,331 --> 00:08:02,293
She was also acting cute,
"Yeah, yeah... Really? Hahaha."

166
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:06,045
Just then the waiter arrived,
"Sir, would you like to order?"

167
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,477
I asked for some friedpapad and mint chutney.

168
00:08:09,644 --> 00:08:11,049
I mean, I didn't know!

169
00:08:11,129 --> 00:08:12,346
What does one get there?

170
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,880
So this waiter looks at me with,
'You don't belong here' look.

171
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,427
Then he noticed
that I was with a girl.

172
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:25,396
Now there is this one thing
that is pretty amazing about guys.

173
00:08:25,774 --> 00:08:29,093
The moment they see
a guy with a girl,

174
00:08:29,623 --> 00:08:32,758
99% of them implement the common code,

175
00:08:32,838 --> 00:08:35,190
which is, 'The Legendary Bro Code.'

176
00:08:39,623 --> 00:08:43,666
A guy who's with a girl is forgiven
three over smart mistakes.

177
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,424
Because we get it, brother.

178
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:47,884
We get it.

179
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:49,159
You're trying.

180
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,716
You would've heard guys say this,
during a fight,

181
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:55,764
"Look, I'm letting you go
because you're with a girl.

182
00:08:58,423 --> 00:08:59,365
This guy...

183
00:08:59,445 --> 00:09:00,423
Means it.

184
00:09:02,814 --> 00:09:05,706
So the next time
your husband, boyfriend

185
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,449
or the apple of your eye,

186
00:09:10,436 --> 00:09:12,314
acts like a 'Protector Supreme Fuckface'...

187
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:22,679
Tell him, 'You've been saved
many a times because of us too.

188
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,557
It's only because of you that
he's spared a thrashing.'

189
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:29,070
Otherwise, he'd be in a torn shirt,
three teeth missing,

190
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,801
asking for his phone.

191
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,504
"No, please. My phone...

192
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:38,329
Just please give me the phone...
Please. I'm...

193
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:39,924
I'm sorry... My phone, please.

194
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:42,532
Please just give me
my phone back, please..."

195
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:46,752
So the waiter saw
that I was with a girl.

196
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:48,779
As a discount, he said,

197
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:52,752
"Sir, we don't have papad, sir.
Are wafers alright?"

198
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,468
I said, "Yeah, anything crispy will do."

199
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,793
We began talking...

200
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:01,049
On the table, there are three
box-type things kept.

201
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:02,941
Those small little cup-like things?

202
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:06,847
One has water with
a few cut green chillies.

203
00:10:10,739 --> 00:10:12,806
The other has red chutney for momos,

204
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,252
and the third, a green mint chutney.

205
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,603
And I like mint chutney.

206
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:20,004
The waiter bought wafers.

207
00:10:20,084 --> 00:10:21,347
Big, huge wafers.

208
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,644
And there was no spoon.

209
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:25,643
So then I...
I mean you understand, right?

210
00:10:25,886 --> 00:10:27,386
You know, it's difficult to dip...

211
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:32,170
So I took the chutney
and put it on the wafer.

212
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,724
Spread it nice and even.

213
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,685
The moment I had a bite...

214
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,103
There was darkness.

215
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:45,305
I saw...

216
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,090
Lord Brahma standing on the left.

217
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:54,671
Two steps on his right was Baba Nanak,

218
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:59,712
and between the two appeared Jesus.

219
00:11:00,469 --> 00:11:03,334
They seemed like friends hanging
around with hands on the shoulder.

220
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:13,448
And from the back,
I could see the light of Allah!

221
00:11:15,653 --> 00:11:17,480
And all four of them told me,

222
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,636
"Listen...

223
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,405
This isn't mint chutney."

224
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:31,112
Who all know what sushi is,
raise your hands.

225
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:34,053
Who all don't know
what sushi is, at all.

226
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,264
It's okay, even I didn't know.

227
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:39,923
Your brother is here.

228
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:41,977
He won't go without telling you.

229
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,150
So sushi, basically is...

230
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,826
Shit wrapped in stinky rice!

231
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,598
You haven't missed a thing.

232
00:11:58,171 --> 00:11:59,339
Nothing!

233
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:01,652
And it has to be eaten with poison.

234
00:12:02,993 --> 00:12:03,782
What is it called?

235
00:12:03,862 --> 00:12:04,409
What's the name?

236
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:05,857
(Audience prompts)

237
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:08,062
Wasabi?! It should be called
the devil's cum!

238
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,852
Dude, my whole body was on fire!

239
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:18,658
All my orifices opened up!

240
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:23,760
I mean it got so bad that my soul left
my body and stood at the door,

241
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,831
"What now?

242
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,047
Should I just go?

243
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:35,815
Are you listening?

244
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:37,490
Should I leave?

245
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:41,783
Can you bear this pain, yes or no?"

246
00:12:43,005 --> 00:12:44,659
I said, "No, no.
Please come back, come back."

247
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,940
Now, the people endorsing
sushi always tell you,

248
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,415
"Oh, come on,
it's an acquired taste."

249
00:12:49,495 --> 00:12:50,680
Why? Is it anal sex?

250
00:12:53,719 --> 00:12:55,448
That I must make a habit of?!

251
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:57,347
If it tastes good, it does!

252
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,508
If it doesn't, it doesn't!

253
00:12:58,757 --> 00:12:59,892
Move on!

254
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:04,412
Back at the restaurant,
people came around me.

255
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,388
The girl kept asking, "Are you alright?

256
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:06,401
Are you alright? Are you alright?"

257
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:10,109
So did the waiter, "Sir sir, sir.
Sir, water, sir!

258
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:10,890
Sir, sugar, sir!

259
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,774
Sir, honey, sir!"

260
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:14,315
And I was so irritated
that I wanted to punch someone.

261
00:13:17,872 --> 00:13:21,613
I had to go to the bathroom
to come back to life.

262
00:13:22,272 --> 00:13:23,569
Took me ten minutes.

263
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,104
I came back,
my date was a disaster.

264
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,580
At least that's what it was in my mind.

265
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:33,687
I sat down. We talked for a bit.
Restored some normalcy.

266
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:36,736
And suddenly she threw a nuclear bomb.

267
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,698
But of course, I couldn't care less.

268
00:13:39,957 --> 00:13:40,682
Firm.

269
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:44,001
She said, "Uh... Listen, I just
want to be very clear about this.

270
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:47,633
This is our first meeting and I don't
want to you to have any wrong ideas...

271
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,374
That... You know, I really like you but

272
00:13:51,454 --> 00:13:54,141
I just want to be only friends with you.

273
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:56,249
And...

274
00:13:58,239 --> 00:14:01,352
And I don't want to have
any kind of relationship.

275
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:04,369
And I don't want you to
have any kind of idea about it."

276
00:14:10,456 --> 00:14:14,240
I said, "Yeah yeah. Totally."

277
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:17,796
But, I mean such a lovely girl.

278
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,785
Such a happy girl.

279
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,968
How could I not fall in love?

280
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:23,575
I thought she's the best.

281
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:24,650
I just want her in my life.

282
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,122
We continued to meet three-four times

283
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:27,862
and on the fifth, I proposed.

284
00:14:28,478 --> 00:14:29,169
I said, "Listen, come here."

285
00:14:29,249 --> 00:14:29,602
She said, "Yes?"

286
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:30,596
I said, "I love you."

287
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,088
She said, "No, I had told you..."

288
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,421
I said, "Hahaha, no no no,
I don't want an answer.

289
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:39,019
I love you."

290
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:48,046
"But I have... I mean... I..."

291
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:49,357
I said, "Listen...
I don't need an answer."

292
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,206
She asked, "Then what are you doing
and why are you doing this?"

293
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:54,165
I said, "I'm expressing
my love and reserving my seat.

294
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,553
Reserving my chances."

295
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:01,256
She said, "Will this affect..."

296
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:04,370
I said, "It won't affect a thing.
Let's go. Let's go.

297
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,321
Nothing, nothing. Let's go."

298
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,716
Now it was all going well
and hunky dory.

299
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:15,721
You know one-sided love,
it's the most beautiful phase.

300
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:17,030
Firstly...

301
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:22,522
Firstly, nobody will agree
but I want to say this,

302
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:26,653
one-sided love is also a relationship.

303
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,594
One minute!

304
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:35,755
Just because she is not
participating in this,

305
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,831
it does not mean that I am not
investing in this relationship.

306
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,059
And the most beautiful thing
about one-sided relationships is that

307
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:45,875
it does not depend on anyone.

308
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:47,340
It's all about how you feel.

309
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,121
If it's love, it's love.

310
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,900
And it's so volatile!

311
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,545
So... So filled with action,
this one-sided love affair!

312
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,121
Do you know why?
In a normal relationship,

313
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,540
the day you fall in love, you win.

314
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,567
And the day you break-up, you lose.

315
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,243
But one-sided relationships
are beautiful...

316
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:05,198
Because you win everyday

317
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:06,837
and you lose everyday.

318
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,950
I was completely in love, dude.

319
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,067
It is like, my dil goes hmm...
hmm... hmm.

320
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,088
We started meeting...

321
00:16:21,385 --> 00:16:23,385
Have you seen how boyfriends walk?

322
00:16:24,215 --> 00:16:26,500
Like they are going
to drop dead any moment.

323
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,445
"Do you want to eat something?"

324
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:45,189
And have you ever seen a guy
who is chasing a girl?

325
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,352
The way he walks...
He has a different charm on his face!

326
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:48,703
Like... "Yeah, yeah!"

327
00:16:52,435 --> 00:16:53,581
He agrees to every single thing...

328
00:16:53,661 --> 00:16:55,552
You just want to see
the other person happy

329
00:16:55,632 --> 00:16:57,540
and you crave for their approval...

330
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:00,200
One day we were talking and she said,

331
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,256
"Do you watch cricket?"

332
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:02,810
I said, "Of course."

333
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,040
She said, "I also watch cricket!"

334
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,360
I thought, 'Oh man!

335
00:17:06,586 --> 00:17:08,621
How awesome is she!

336
00:17:11,715 --> 00:17:13,378
I mean she watches cricket!'

337
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:17,350
She says, "I just want to tell you that

338
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,539
I don't think Sachin is
that great a batsman."

339
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:22,877
I was like, "What? What,
what, what?"

340
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:25,432
She said, "No, the younger
boys are so much better.

341
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:26,838
They're like,
they're so raw.

342
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:28,730
Like, Virat Kohli abuses, like, right?

343
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:31,662
But he plays, like, he plays also,
like, he doesn't behave like a God,

344
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:32,540
like, I want to like, like...

345
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,000
And he's not, like, greedy
about his centuries and all..."

346
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,900
And in my head I'm like...

347
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:38,027
"AYE!

348
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:42,257
Sachin is the true big
daddy of them all, okay?!"

349
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:50,769
But within you, resides a guy...

350
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,512
He is looking to hook you up,

351
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,579
and will give you
the best advice in life.

352
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:03,390
I was about to say,

353
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,133
"Sachin? You don't know
a thing about him..."

354
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:06,158
It was on the tip of my tongue

355
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:06,917
but then that guy inside asked,

356
00:18:06,997 --> 00:18:09,201
"Tell me one thing,
do you want to kiss Sachin?

357
00:18:10,403 --> 00:18:11,173
So then, shut up."

358
00:18:11,253 --> 00:18:12,416
I said...

359
00:18:12,862 --> 00:18:14,295
She asked me, "What do you think?
What do you think?"

360
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:15,686
I said, "Yeah, yeah."

361
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:22,855
One day when we met, I noticed

362
00:18:23,287 --> 00:18:25,808
her hair is all tied up and oiled.

363
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,619
And she's not wearing kajal too.

364
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,282
The 'No-Kajal Look',

365
00:18:32,863 --> 00:18:35,255
is always a statement.

366
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:37,498
It says something.

367
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,444
Are you listening to this?

368
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:41,673
It is the laugh of approval.

369
00:18:43,687 --> 00:18:45,552
It says something.
Now we have an institute...

370
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,768
A small research and
development institute called

371
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:50,066
'The Sakt Launda Institute of Research'.

372
00:18:52,336 --> 00:18:54,579
Our head scientist submits
various papers on this subject.

373
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:56,106
His name is Zakir Khan.

374
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:59,741
It is fun to refer to yourself
in the third person.

375
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:01,998
He writes papers and
keeps submitting them.

376
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,674
So in this research that we have...

377
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:06,835
It talks about the 'No-Kajal Look'.

378
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:09,497
The 'No-Kajal Look' is always
a statement. It's never empty.

379
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:11,240
It says something.

380
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:15,874
It is either 'I'm not well'

381
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:21,050
or 'I'm breaking up' or 'things
at home are not great'...

382
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:24,186
And the research has come up with
a very interesting reason for it.

383
00:19:24,266 --> 00:19:25,402
I am sure there are other reasons too.

384
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:28,459
One of the reasons is called,

385
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:29,564
The 'Run-Up Look'.

386
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:36,767
This look is in force when a new, hot,
stud has moved in the neighbourhood.

387
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:41,402
And she is in dire
need of his attention.

388
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:43,740
So what happens is...

389
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,996
She doesn't wear Kajal for two days.

390
00:19:52,835 --> 00:19:54,400
And on the third day
when she does,

391
00:19:54,442 --> 00:19:55,767
the whole world
goes crazy and says

392
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,362
"Who is this girl?"

393
00:19:57,727 --> 00:19:59,308
And everyone starts dancing
and singing around her,

394
00:19:59,538 --> 00:20:02,362
"Oh you beautiful angel,
the one after my heart,

395
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,484
you are the queen of
youth and gorgeous of all,

396
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:07,998
beauty soap bar Nirma!"

397
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:12,011
Now I noticed that

398
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,052
she's not wearing Kajal.

399
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:14,900
I've been around her for a while.

400
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,173
So, the 'No Kajal Look' is not for me.

401
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,863
I thought, there is a question
that needs to be asked here,

402
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:21,971
which is...

403
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:23,444
"What happened?"

404
00:20:25,229 --> 00:20:27,823
She said, "Man, I just wanted
to tell you that...

405
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,972
I'm going through a very bad phase."

406
00:20:36,175 --> 00:20:37,783
I asked, "As in, what do you mean?

407
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,229
Tell me... I'm listening."

408
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,899
She says, "There's a guy in my college,
and we were together for three years...

409
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,046
And then he proposed me.

410
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:50,040
And now... Things are not...

411
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,304
Everything is haywire.

412
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:56,524
I am just going through a very
bad phase and I'm breaking up with him."

413
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,635
I'm listening to her with
all my attention. With rapt attention

414
00:20:59,715 --> 00:21:02,367
using all the keywords
to show that I'm listening.

415
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,681
"Yeah yeah, totally."

416
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:07,245
I'm saying, "Of course,
Oh my God!

417
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:12,065
What a shitty person!
Who does this?

418
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,052
No no no no,
you were absolutely right.

419
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:14,677
Absolutely correct.

420
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:15,793
That's what you should've done.

421
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:16,558
What you did is right..."

422
00:21:16,638 --> 00:21:17,820
I'm saying all these things,

423
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,645
"Yes, yes." Listening attentively.

424
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:21,413
But there is this guy
who resides in you.

425
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:24,480
He has his own commentary on,

426
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,349
and is doing a Harsha Bhogle.

427
00:21:29,884 --> 00:21:30,965
He's saying,

428
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:33,623
"Come on, come on, come, come!"

429
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,983
"Come on, come on, come, come!"

430
00:21:40,138 --> 00:21:41,300
But after listening
to her side of the story,

431
00:21:41,336 --> 00:21:43,468
I understood a girl's
point of view for the first time.

432
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,702
How they view a relationship.

433
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,235
What I understood is,

434
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:50,408
that a lot of times,
they sink to their lowest

435
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:51,953
to save a relationship.

436
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:53,857
Things they normally
wouldn't do for anyone,

437
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:55,210
they would do it for them.

438
00:21:55,978 --> 00:22:00,724
But when you push them hard,

439
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:03,185
that's when they snap.

440
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:07,779
Then they are like,
'Okay, now...

441
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:10,313
I'm done.'

442
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:15,118
You must've seen this...

443
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:16,958
They'll say things like, "Can't
live without you, stay without you,

444
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:18,667
I'll dust and sweep for you,
clean your toilet,

445
00:22:18,747 --> 00:22:19,689
I'll do anything and everything...

446
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,340
Get out of my sight, asshole.

447
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,008
But guys... I'm a guy too.

448
00:22:29,088 --> 00:22:31,646
I'll tell you our side right now.

449
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:32,576
Guys have a problem.

450
00:22:32,656 --> 00:22:37,304
We are genetically
and emotionally not evolved.

451
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,037
Because, we were busy fighting wars.

452
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:45,718
Fighting is stupid...

453
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:48,917
But that's what we were
doing for many years.

454
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:50,523
Now that it's stopped.

455
00:22:50,932 --> 00:22:52,641
We have to bring
emotions to the table.

456
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,466
But... We didn't bring those.

457
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:58,380
They got left behind
some 400 years ago...

458
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,192
That's why in most relationships,

459
00:23:02,272 --> 00:23:04,705
guys over-commit and under-deliver.

460
00:23:06,283 --> 00:23:09,685
We just talk the talk,
but don't walk the walk.

461
00:23:12,973 --> 00:23:15,865
So, when you see a girl
bending over backwards for you,

462
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:18,436
you feel wow, such an amazing girl.

463
00:23:19,268 --> 00:23:20,685
What a nice girl.

464
00:23:21,751 --> 00:23:23,694
Come, let's become a better human.

465
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:27,885
But now the girl...

466
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:29,886
Just see how both their
directions have gone apart.

467
00:23:30,149 --> 00:23:31,011
The girl is thinking...

468
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,442
Now...

469
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:35,013
Just make one mistake.

470
00:23:36,853 --> 00:23:39,336
That's why guys aren't able
to contemplate their break ups.

471
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,133
Their thing is, "Dude, I was just..."

472
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,769
I mean they get very incident-specific.

473
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:43,608
They don't get that

474
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:45,661
this whole drama has been
going on for quite sometime.

475
00:23:45,865 --> 00:23:47,355
So they get really incident
specific like, "Dude, ya..."

476
00:23:47,435 --> 00:23:49,779
"Bro, I'd gone to
the toilet... I was shitting...

477
00:23:52,861 --> 00:23:54,453
She asked me how much time
I'm going to take.

478
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,447
I said, "Two minutes" but when
I came out after four, she was gone!

479
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:01,566
I mean I took two extra minutes
and she broke up with me?!

480
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:03,129
Bro, tell me who does this?"

481
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,701
I said, "No, asshole, this
was a pile up of all the old stuff."

482
00:24:11,147 --> 00:24:12,014
One day we met and I said,

483
00:24:12,094 --> 00:24:13,966
"Let's have something Indian,
enough of your fancy places."

484
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:15,909
She said, "Okay, okay."

485
00:24:16,142 --> 00:24:17,194
We reached. Got a seat.

486
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:18,896
Now I have 360 degree vision.

487
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,824
We were talking and
looking at the menu.

488
00:24:22,233 --> 00:24:24,599
And I notice this guy
coming toward us.

489
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:26,410
He's getting closer...

490
00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:30,470
And all over his face,
it's written, 'I'm fucked'.

491
00:24:33,362 --> 00:24:35,129
Now he has come really close.

492
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:38,138
He stops at our table.
Just standing.

493
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:40,650
I'm trying to ignore,
but have all my attention on him.

494
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,600
I'm also trying to read the menu
because I'm really hungry.

495
00:24:44,594 --> 00:24:46,086
He comes up to the table and says,

496
00:24:46,847 --> 00:24:47,500
"Reema...

497
00:24:49,297 --> 00:24:51,123
Can I talk to you for two minutes?"

498
00:24:52,466 --> 00:24:54,701
I got irritated and said 'Motherfucker!'

499
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:02,881
My true emotions, of course.

500
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:04,984
You understood who this was?

501
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,733
Now these two, start talking...

502
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,667
I'm stuck between them.
What do I do.

503
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:16,669
I don't know if I can
interrupt or not.

504
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:20,700
Because firstly, this guy
hasn't even buttoned up properly.

505
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:23,738
What do I tell him
in the middle of all this?

506
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:25,491
Okay?

507
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:28,003
Secondly, he's crying and everything.

508
00:25:28,083 --> 00:25:29,201
He's talking to her.

509
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:31,388
And third, he wasn't being aggressive,

510
00:25:31,468 --> 00:25:33,012
so I wasn't even getting
a chance to intervene.

511
00:25:33,393 --> 00:25:35,014
Fourth, I'm not even her boyfriend,

512
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,249
to tell him things...

513
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,791
And fifth. This dude
knows her from so long.

514
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,149
I mean of course they should talk.

515
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:43,874
He knows her for past seven years,

516
00:25:43,954 --> 00:25:44,903
the least he can do is talk to her.

517
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:48,408
I thought maybe I should play
the alpha male card.

518
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:51,183
Maybe I should just
push and slap him away.

519
00:25:51,263 --> 00:25:52,469
She might get impressed...

520
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:53,652
"You are my man!"

521
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,132
I don't know. Who knows?

522
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:59,757
WHO the hell knows?
Does anyone really know this game?

523
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:01,217
I don't know.
What are we supposed to do?

524
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,969
We're all trying!

525
00:26:04,372 --> 00:26:05,671
Do whatever that will work.

526
00:26:07,716 --> 00:26:09,060
And to top it all I was famished.

527
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,725
So I decided,

528
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:12,010
to call for biryani.

529
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:17,370
Now here he is
talking to her and...

530
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:21,168
I'm eating but I can hear everything.
I'm listening to every word!

531
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,234
I'm a very judgmental person.

532
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,183
I am so judgmental that...

533
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:27,083
You know your parents say, "Do it,
or what will people say?"

534
00:26:29,902 --> 00:26:30,968
I'm one of those people.

535
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:39,323
Now, he's saying such
sweet things to her.

536
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:40,257
He said...

537
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:42,970
"Everything about my future...

538
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:45,034
I have always imagined with you.

539
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,379
Now when you're not there,
I cannot imagine my future."

540
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:50,103
Such a sweet thing to say.

541
00:26:50,183 --> 00:26:51,446
Like, so sweet.

542
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:53,637
But here I'm being judgmental!

543
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,617
I am completely judging him.

544
00:26:56,953 --> 00:26:59,100
I'm thinking, 'Then this
is your lack of imagination!

545
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:05,234
You can imagine something better, dude!'

546
00:27:07,557 --> 00:27:08,564
These two are still talking...

547
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:09,747
And this boy is going full tilt,
it's a scene.

548
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:10,755
And she's scolding him,

549
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:13,267
"Why are you here? Are you
trying to stalk me? Are you stalking me?

550
00:27:13,347 --> 00:27:14,304
Are you stalking me?
Are you stalking me?!"

551
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,983
And he's like, "No no no no,
I just wanted to see you."

552
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,525
This was obviously a dick move by him.

553
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:20,774
Why... Why did he have to come here?

554
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,653
Then there was a moment
when he held her hand.

555
00:27:24,296 --> 00:27:25,713
I slammed my spoon!

556
00:27:30,022 --> 00:27:31,100
He thought there'll be a fight now.

557
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:32,607
The girl thought the same.

558
00:27:34,331 --> 00:27:36,346
And girls don't want a fight...

559
00:27:36,426 --> 00:27:37,690
Mostly.

560
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,867
Physical fighting,
they just want to avoid.

561
00:27:41,947 --> 00:27:43,722
Because that's the right thing to do.

562
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:46,842
You would've seen, if a girl thinks
a fight is going to break out,

563
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:49,096
they'll do everything to stop it!

564
00:27:49,176 --> 00:27:51,579
She'll use all her energy.
Have you seen it?

565
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:52,573
She'll do anything to stop it,

566
00:27:52,653 --> 00:27:54,274
"No guys please!
Stop it! Stop it! No! No! No!

567
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:56,020
Please please! Back off! Back off!

568
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,305
No no no no! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

569
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:59,138
Stop it! Stop it!
Please! Please! Please please!

570
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:01,672
Don't don't don't fight!
Stop it!"

571
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:04,631
And the guys would have to
calm her down,

572
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:06,390
"Dude, Dalbir, wait!
Just stop.

573
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:10,056
Hold it for a second.

574
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:13,693
Madam, are you okay?

575
00:28:14,628 --> 00:28:16,307
No, do you need some water?

576
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:23,026
We can fight on the next turn too,
no problem!"

577
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:28,372
Now, both are looking at me.

578
00:28:28,452 --> 00:28:30,022
And I don't know why
they are looking at me.

579
00:28:30,388 --> 00:28:32,447
I said, "No no,
you guys continue fighting..."

580
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:35,265
I called the waiter,
"Hey, come here!

581
00:28:35,543 --> 00:28:36,784
Who puts cardamom in biryani?"

582
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:48,850
Both these guys are talking
to each other and I'm listening.

583
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:51,420
And look, happiness is like a bulb.

584
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:53,903
The light has to reach you

585
00:28:54,809 --> 00:28:56,532
but sorrow is like a blackhole.

586
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,212
It just sucks you in.

587
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:01,439
I was indulging in their conversation
and was completely lost.

588
00:29:01,702 --> 00:29:02,316
He was telling her,

589
00:29:02,396 --> 00:29:04,930
"I may be able to get rid of you
but how do I get rid of your memories?

590
00:29:06,405 --> 00:29:07,361
And if you had to leave,

591
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,633
why did you buy me all
these shirts instead of T-shirts?

592
00:29:10,947 --> 00:29:13,200
Am I supposed to meet another
girl wearing those clothes?

593
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:15,022
I've been to every restaurant
with you in this city.

594
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:16,352
All my friends are your friends.

595
00:29:16,432 --> 00:29:18,323
There's no place we
haven't explored together.

596
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:20,047
Now all those places are dead to me...

597
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:20,800
This city is dead.

598
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:22,136
What do I do,
I don't understand a thing.

599
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:23,771
Am I supposed to quit my job
and go somewhere else?"

600
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:25,642
He was saying all of these things...

601
00:29:26,313 --> 00:29:28,700
However, I had heard the girl's side,
and the crux of this conversation was...

602
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,979
'Too late'.

603
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:33,193
So, I'm listening to him.

604
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:35,953
He's just crying and crying
and falls at her feet.

605
00:29:36,033 --> 00:29:37,100
The situation's gotten tense.

606
00:29:37,174 --> 00:29:39,284
Everyone's dropped their spoons
and are observing them now.

607
00:29:39,606 --> 00:29:42,016
A beautiful girl and a sobbing guy,
is the best scene to watch.

608
00:29:43,797 --> 00:29:45,418
You have all the eyeballs.

609
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,100
And he's touching her feet.

610
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:49,363
To which I thought, 'Wrong move'.

611
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:51,261
Okay.

612
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:52,152
Shouldn't have done that.

613
00:29:52,232 --> 00:29:53,045
He should have some self-respect,

614
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,846
a little bit.

615
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:54,999
Okay.

616
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:56,265
That moment she was like, "Now you go.

617
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:58,183
If you stay here,
I'll stop talking to you."

618
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:01,002
He says, "No, no, please, please.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry..."

619
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:02,666
"No, go, just go, just go, just go.

620
00:30:03,492 --> 00:30:04,757
Just go.

621
00:30:04,837 --> 00:30:06,595
I'll call you. I'll call you.
Okay, yes.

622
00:30:06,675 --> 00:30:08,399
I'm here with someone,
try and understand.

623
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:10,436
I'll call you. I'll call you back.
Bye.

624
00:30:12,174 --> 00:30:13,401
Phew.

625
00:30:18,732 --> 00:30:20,003
Now why are you crying?"

626
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:34,500
I said, "This has happened with me too."

627
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,441
After a while she went abroad to study.

628
00:30:40,521 --> 00:30:41,627
Australia or something.

629
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:43,131
Then I was just...

630
00:30:46,694 --> 00:30:49,148
It's not necessary that every stone
you throw will land a fruit.

631
00:30:52,815 --> 00:30:54,553
Some tries are just to prepare yourself.

632
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:00,498
It's not bad.

633
00:31:00,578 --> 00:31:02,206
Don't be disheartened, brother!

634
00:31:03,974 --> 00:31:05,171
No problem.

635
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:06,836
We'll stand again, fight again!

636
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:11,144
I've met lots of different
people in my life.

637
00:31:11,224 --> 00:31:13,408
And this one time
I was in a decent relationship.

638
00:31:13,876 --> 00:31:14,869
Okay.

639
00:31:15,103 --> 00:31:18,535
She was very different
from the previous girl.

640
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:20,700
She was emotionally very volatile.

641
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:22,916
Completely unpredictable!

642
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,389
She would go through
emotional ups and downs.

643
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:27,634
She'd be crying one moment and suddenly
exclaim, "Yes! Let's go someplace!"

644
00:31:27,714 --> 00:31:28,817
I'm like, "Oh shit!"

645
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,296
And I used to worry about it but

646
00:31:34,112 --> 00:31:35,389
you're in a relationship and in love...

647
00:31:35,638 --> 00:31:37,025
One day she texted me saying,

648
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,026
'I am feeling very sad and very low.'

649
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,224
I'm like, 'Again?'

650
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,034
And her scene with books was too much!

651
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,389
Too many books!

652
00:31:48,469 --> 00:31:50,259
She had more books than clothes!

653
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,778
That kind of equation.

654
00:31:51,858 --> 00:31:54,538
And I've never had a major
relationship with books.

655
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:57,889
My aim in life...

656
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:00,843
Physics, chemistry, math books...

657
00:32:02,675 --> 00:32:04,632
Are not that important.

658
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:07,640
Get me a guide and everything's sorted.

659
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:11,467
Especially a guide in which all
the important points are marked!

660
00:32:15,955 --> 00:32:18,088
I went to her place and saw her crying.

661
00:32:19,753 --> 00:32:20,801
Now, your brother is a warrior.

662
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:24,534
He doesn't run from any situation
but faces it.

663
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:28,687
So, like Sherlock Holmes, I calculated
what could've possibly happened...

664
00:32:30,689 --> 00:32:32,139
Now, I knew her
grandmother wasn't well...

665
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:34,216
I thought...

666
00:32:37,135 --> 00:32:38,407
Come on! She's her grandmother,
not mine!

667
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:40,437
Why would I be emotional?

668
00:32:42,196 --> 00:32:44,348
I searched my brain for
'when somebody dies',

669
00:32:44,428 --> 00:32:45,190
a speech popped up...

670
00:32:47,276 --> 00:32:48,418
And I hit play.

671
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,663
Now, what are you supposed
to tell a person who is crying?

672
00:32:51,065 --> 00:32:51,926
"Stop crying?"

673
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,321
They know that!

674
00:32:57,231 --> 00:32:59,803
So, if you're consoling someone,

675
00:32:59,883 --> 00:33:02,159
it doesn't really matter what you say

676
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:04,585
as long as you add just
one emotion after the line.

677
00:33:04,665 --> 00:33:06,500
That is, 'hmm?'

678
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:09,250
That's it.

679
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:12,900
So, I began my speech.
I said...

680
00:33:14,357 --> 00:33:15,066
"Don't cry...

681
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,649
Hmm?"

682
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,489
"If she sees you crying like this,
do you think she'll like it?

683
00:33:24,391 --> 00:33:24,953
Hmm?"

684
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,322
"Why? What do you mean?"

685
00:33:40,162 --> 00:33:43,049
I said, "Grandma...? Hmm?"

686
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,211
She said, "No yaa!
My grandmother didn't die!"

687
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,093
I said, "Okay, okay, okay..."

688
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,719
But your brother's a warrior.

689
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:52,113
Warriors don't abandon the battlefield.

690
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:54,854
I asked, "What happened?"

691
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,229
Wha...What?

692
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,254
"I keep buying these books

693
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:14,603
and never have time to read them."

694
00:34:17,144 --> 00:34:19,830
And I'm listening with full attention.

695
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:21,419
I said, "Yes, yeah?
I keep buying these...

696
00:34:21,499 --> 00:34:23,196
Yes, tell... Tell me what happened.

697
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:24,599
yeah and?"

698
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:26,772
She said,

699
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:33,313
"Will you have some tea?"

700
00:34:33,551 --> 00:34:34,665
I'm just standing there...

701
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:41,755
She asks, "What?"

702
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:45,043
I asked, "And then?"

703
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:46,121
She replies, "That's it."

704
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:47,254
I just went, "What?!"

705
00:34:50,728 --> 00:34:51,839
She asked, "Do you get it?"

706
00:34:52,014 --> 00:34:54,470
I said, "Yeah, I get it."

707
00:34:55,312 --> 00:34:56,002
She asks, "What should I do?"

708
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:57,861
I said, "Nothing...

709
00:34:57,941 --> 00:35:00,177
You could read them to me."

710
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,312
She said, "Yes! That's
what we'll do from now on!

711
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,360
Yes! Yes!"

712
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:08,348
I said, "Alright, fine."

713
00:35:10,013 --> 00:35:11,884
Now, I have office
from nine in the morning,

714
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:15,370
which I suffer till ten in the night.

715
00:35:17,756 --> 00:35:19,568
Have food and then listen to a book.

716
00:35:22,526 --> 00:35:24,222
Then do some other stuff for a bit.

717
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:27,987
There's still time...
The day hasn't ended yet.

718
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:30,841
Now, she will talk about
everything that happened.

719
00:35:31,343 --> 00:35:32,302
Like, "You know what?

720
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:35,694
It was like two stars meeting...

721
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:39,646
It was like souls hugging each other...

722
00:35:41,657 --> 00:35:43,329
And you know when you touched me...

723
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:46,681
the sky was this and the moon was that

724
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:49,375
and the stars were
this and the cloud was that

725
00:35:49,455 --> 00:35:52,837
and there was the ray
of moon penetrating the clouds

726
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,521
falling on the window...

727
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,152
Nonchalantly touched your cheek."

728
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:03,494
No matter how poetic that may sound,

729
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:06,555
it was fucking four in the morning.

730
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,706
And I was sleepy as hell.

731
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,904
You know when your
eyelids shut on their own...

732
00:36:18,984 --> 00:36:20,624
my neck kept drooping, dude!

733
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:26,617
And to top it all
was this shit 'Nonchalant'?

734
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:32,393
I was like, 'What was that?'
and woke up!

735
00:36:32,473 --> 00:36:34,031
I was wondering what did she just say?

736
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:36,047
What is this, 'Nonchalant'?

737
00:36:36,473 --> 00:36:37,764
I thought of going to the bathroom,
she'd used that word twice already,

738
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:39,139
what if she asks me about it?

739
00:36:39,907 --> 00:36:41,803
I went to the bathroom,
took out my phone

740
00:36:41,883 --> 00:36:43,059
and typed 'Nonchalant'.

741
00:36:44,098 --> 00:36:45,202
No result.

742
00:36:46,689 --> 00:36:48,027
Google also stepped aside!

743
00:36:53,696 --> 00:36:54,837
I said, "Tell me!"

744
00:36:57,082 --> 00:36:57,746
"Huh?"

745
00:36:58,588 --> 00:36:59,598
"Tell me!"

746
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:01,666
He said, "No I won't..."

747
00:37:02,526 --> 00:37:03,434
I asked, "Why?"

748
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:05,716
He said, "The spelling is really wrong, dude."

749
00:37:15,044 --> 00:37:15,512
I said, "Huh?"

750
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:17,402
I must have tried 25 times!

751
00:37:17,482 --> 00:37:18,870
"At least tell me
something related to it..."

752
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,987
He said, "Brother,
if there was any connect,

753
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:21,397
I would've asked, 'Did you mean'?"

754
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,025
"Okay, fine! I'll try something"

755
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,758
After 25 tries, he asked,

756
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:28,940
"Are you looking for,
'Nonchalant'?"

757
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,638
I said, "Yes!"

758
00:37:29,718 --> 00:37:31,200
"So why are you writing SH, it's CH..."

759
00:37:31,262 --> 00:37:34,775
I said, "Just tell me, don't
judge my grammar now, tell me!"

760
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,104
It's been 25 minutes...

761
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:41,211
Right now, in my head
'Nonchalant' means unicorn's shit.

762
00:37:44,748 --> 00:37:46,282
So much effort for this one word.

763
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:49,995
Somehow my 2G connection
managed to open the page.

764
00:37:52,774 --> 00:37:54,186
And I found out that it meant,

765
00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:56,787
'Effortlessly'!

766
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,622
And I thought, "Just a minute!

767
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,957
The one thing that cannot
possibly mean effortless

768
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:04,926
is "Non-fucking-chalant!"

769
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:15,910
I could not listen to books
everyday, anymore!

770
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,669
My ears were bleeding!

771
00:38:19,745 --> 00:38:21,261
I gathered up the courage to tell her.

772
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,281
I said, "Listen, come here.

773
00:38:22,898 --> 00:38:25,116
This relationship
is getting too intense...

774
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:29,419
You stay at your place
and I'll stay at mine."

775
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:31,276
She said, "But book, book...

776
00:38:31,356 --> 00:38:32,637
How will I read it to you?"

777
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:35,229
I said, "You...

778
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:37,950
You could just read it
to me on the phone...

779
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:39,532
Yes!"

780
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:41,403
I thought, 'Of course!'

781
00:38:41,483 --> 00:38:43,698
"Yeah, yeah yeah. Yes! Yes yes!

782
00:38:44,076 --> 00:38:45,913
You could read to me on the phone!"

783
00:38:46,176 --> 00:38:46,961
She said, "Really? You'll listen?"

784
00:38:47,041 --> 00:38:47,467
I said...

785
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:55,886
"Why not?"

786
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,470
Bro, this wave of happiness
came over my life...

787
00:39:02,454 --> 00:39:03,184
Yes!

788
00:39:04,044 --> 00:39:06,926
I finished three books
in a month, dude!

789
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:09,377
Six chapters a day!

790
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:11,117
What do I have to do anyway?

791
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:14,111
"Hmm, okay, alright!"

792
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:22,500
So, I would listen to her.

793
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:23,736
For a month, month and a half

794
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:24,767
my lovely little scam continued.

795
00:39:26,582 --> 00:39:27,761
And it was brilliant...

796
00:39:28,248 --> 00:39:31,307
But one day...
I was listening to her.

797
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:32,897
I was, I was paying attention.

798
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:34,748
I was listening to everything

799
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:35,982
but what happened was,

800
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:37,903
I had put my pillow in place...

801
00:39:40,036 --> 00:39:40,794
Okay?

802
00:39:41,701 --> 00:39:43,835
And I had covered myself in blanket...

803
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:46,520
But I was listening!

804
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:48,316
Please, I was listening!

805
00:39:49,569 --> 00:39:50,917
I also switched off the lights...

806
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:55,810
Switched on the AC and set it,
at the sweetest 22 degrees.

807
00:39:57,373 --> 00:40:00,236
Oh! How sweet is 22...

808
00:40:02,163 --> 00:40:04,820
Not hot like 24 degrees
or prickly cold like 21!

809
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:06,074
Sweet, just sweet!

810
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:11,020
So, I am listening to her,

811
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:13,501
but am a bit sleepy as well

812
00:40:18,113 --> 00:40:20,499
and have begun to dream.

813
00:40:24,475 --> 00:40:25,616
But I am still listening!

814
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:27,787
I don't know if this
has ever happened with you...

815
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,870
I mean, she's talking
but I'm also dreaming

816
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:35,138
and what she is saying is
randomly fitting into my dreams.

817
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:40,770
Mixing these two things I say
something completely different.

818
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,763
I said, "So, what did you
tell Aamir Khan?"

819
00:40:50,424 --> 00:40:52,220
She asked, "What? What, what?

820
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:54,269
You're sleeping, aren't you?

821
00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:55,372
You are sleeping, you're sleeping, right?!"

822
00:40:55,531 --> 00:40:56,504
I said, "No no no no..."
and woke up.

823
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,375
I said, "No, no, I wasn't sleeping.
I'm awake, I'm awake,

824
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,124
I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm awake!"

825
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:01,903
I want to say, it doesn't
matter if you're a boy or a girl...

826
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,561
if you're in a relationship
and you catch your partner red-handed,

827
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:07,506
just forgive them.

828
00:41:08,927 --> 00:41:10,518
Even if he's saying, "No no,
I haven't done anything!"

829
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,277
Because they know that
you have caught them.

830
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:14,204
Maybe they'll improve?

831
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,284
Now, your brother is a warrior.
He won't give up.

832
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:20,192
But, turns out,
your Bhabhi is a legend warrior!

833
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:23,485
She also didn't give up!

834
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:25,122
She said, "You were sleeping
and you'll admit it!"

835
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,171
She wouldn't rest until
she had my hands twisted,

836
00:41:27,803 --> 00:41:29,453
her knee on my back,

837
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:32,399
my face in the dirt
as she forced me to say,

838
00:41:32,479 --> 00:41:35,702
"Yes, I was sleeping..."

839
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,518
That is when she felt better.

840
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,600
Even after persuading so much...

841
00:41:41,638 --> 00:41:42,521
this happened five to six times.

842
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,120
That's the problem with nagging...

843
00:41:44,851 --> 00:41:46,628
You tend to become free.

844
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:49,953
Then you admit it, "Yeah, I slept."

845
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:52,188
"Last night, did you sleep off?"

846
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:53,405
"Of course I slept!

847
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,099
It's called sleep and I slept!"

848
00:41:58,289 --> 00:41:59,206
She said, "This is no way to behave!"

849
00:41:59,286 --> 00:42:00,381
I said, "I'll tell you what's a way.

850
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:02,134
Simple logic, easy to understand...

851
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:04,071
Day, awake.

852
00:42:04,735 --> 00:42:06,447
Night, asleep!

853
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,854
She said, "You're such a rude guy,
I don't want to talk to you!"

854
00:42:11,934 --> 00:42:14,034
I said, "Wait a minute!
I don't want to talk to you!"

855
00:42:15,802 --> 00:42:17,599
I must've said these words
for the first time...

856
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,650
But the moment I said it
I felt good.

857
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,310
And I realised that, actually...

858
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:29,153
I don't want to talk to her!

859
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:33,793
I cut the call.

860
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:36,169
She didn't call me back and
the next day she was travelling.

861
00:42:36,347 --> 00:42:37,713
I didn't even text!

862
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,595
I mean, is she the only one with ego?

863
00:42:42,232 --> 00:42:44,010
Now I'm thinking,

864
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:46,339
'Should I break up?!'

865
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,625
Waves of happiness came over me!

866
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,030
My heart was leaping and bounding.

867
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,970
Because what had
always happened with me,

868
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:02,431
I'd be able to do that.

869
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:09,943
I was practicing
for different scenarios,

870
00:43:11,018 --> 00:43:12,019
what am I going to say.

871
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:14,723
And I had planned everything like,
"Listen, listen, listen...

872
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:21,477
I don't think it's working between us."

873
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:24,396
And!

874
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:28,297
Last line... This is not the only line!
It does get complete...

875
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,059
"It's not you, it's me!"

876
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:41,473
Fifteen days later,
she came back

877
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:43,546
and texted, 'Hey.'

878
00:43:45,174 --> 00:43:46,306
I replied, 'Hi.'

879
00:43:49,187 --> 00:43:51,086
My breakup plans were
going full steam ahead.

880
00:43:51,854 --> 00:43:55,335
She texted, 'I'm back in town.
Hope you are fine.'

881
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,178
I wrote, 'Fine.'

882
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,968
She said, 'I was thinking
that we should discuss this.'

883
00:44:02,632 --> 00:44:04,213
I wrote back, 'Absolutely.'

884
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:07,647
I reached home.

885
00:44:07,727 --> 00:44:09,452
Got ready for a breakup.

886
00:44:10,594 --> 00:44:12,343
I reached home, took off my shirt.

887
00:44:13,447 --> 00:44:14,982
Wore a Deadpool t-shirt.

888
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:24,018
Took off my shoes, my jeans
and wore three-fourths

889
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,058
and slippers!

890
00:44:29,687 --> 00:44:31,205
Just like the 'No-Kajal Look'
is a statement,

891
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:32,989
the same way slippers
are also a statement.

892
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:36,328
I will not get ready for you, take that!

893
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:47,499
It was five o'clock,
in excitement I entered the wrong gully!

894
00:44:49,276 --> 00:44:50,848
I took the stairs,
to her third-floor flat.

895
00:44:50,928 --> 00:44:52,476
That's how much excitement,
was coursing through me!

896
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,514
I was bubbling over!

897
00:44:54,431 --> 00:44:57,082
I rang the bell, she opened the
door and looked at me with a stink eye.

898
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,231
She looked me up and down.

899
00:44:59,311 --> 00:45:00,681
I thought, 'Tick mark!'

900
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,358
'Plan A, successful!'

901
00:45:07,791 --> 00:45:09,901
She said, "Come, come, come, come.

902
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:11,047
Sit sit sit."

903
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:11,887
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm comfortable.

904
00:45:11,967 --> 00:45:12,872
I'm comfortable, yeah.
I'm comfortable, yes"

905
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:13,807
"Sit sit sit sit!"

906
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:14,706
I said, "Yeah yeah..."

907
00:45:15,155 --> 00:45:16,998
So, I'm just sitting and I heard her.

908
00:45:17,078 --> 00:45:17,672
(sniffles)

909
00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:18,851
You know that sound, from the kitchen...

910
00:45:18,931 --> 00:45:20,188
I thought, 'No no no no,

911
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:23,033
don't get caught in that! Stay firm...'

912
00:45:23,651 --> 00:45:26,503
So, I'm sitting quietly, just looking
at her house.

913
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:27,215
I saw she's bought more books.

914
00:45:27,295 --> 00:45:28,413
I said, 'Huh, dude!'

915
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:34,185
In my heart, I was thinking,
'It's good that I'm breaking up

916
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:35,320
otherwise I'd have
to listen to these too!'

917
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,926
Let the next one suffer!'

918
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,194
I was sitting and
wasn't paying attention

919
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:45,178
when she snuck up on
me and stabbed me in the back!

920
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:48,246
I wasn't alert and she
came up and said,

921
00:45:48,326 --> 00:45:50,815
"Listen! I don't think
it's working between you and me!

922
00:45:50,895 --> 00:45:53,008
And it's not you, it's me!"

923
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,236
I said, 'No! No no no!'

924
00:45:56,316 --> 00:45:59,304
I said, 'No no no no,
please wait, wait, wait, wait!

925
00:45:59,384 --> 00:46:00,969
Lets do this again,
repeat please.

926
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:02,729
I wasn't paying attention.

927
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:04,617
I... I... once again, once again!'

928
00:46:04,697 --> 00:46:08,451
I'll go back down,
come up, you open the door...

929
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,858
Let's just do it again...
I'll... I'll...

930
00:46:11,214 --> 00:46:14,199
Dude, you completely
stole my thunder! This is not done!'

931
00:46:21,579 --> 00:46:24,863
You know, it's not like nothing
ever worked out properly!

932
00:46:25,855 --> 00:46:27,670
Things happened one time...

933
00:46:28,381 --> 00:46:30,374
Maybe not as expected,
but it did happen.

934
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,974
I was on Facebook at 10-10:30 pm

935
00:46:35,182 --> 00:46:37,727
and a girl texted saying 'hi'.

936
00:46:40,618 --> 00:46:42,320
One of those rare moments of life?

937
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:46,250
When a girl says 'hi' on her own.

938
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:49,449
And this girl had
been my childhood crush.

939
00:46:49,801 --> 00:46:50,428
Big time crush.

940
00:46:50,596 --> 00:46:51,701
You know those girls that

941
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:54,900
come to math coaching classes in
ninth grade, only for two days?

942
00:47:00,778 --> 00:47:02,091
And those two days seem as though

943
00:47:02,171 --> 00:47:04,558
they've apparated out
of a cloud of perfume.

944
00:47:04,763 --> 00:47:07,766
The whole class is awkward,
everyone's staring.

945
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:09,136
And then they quit the class

946
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:10,816
because there are too
many ass-holes around.

947
00:47:14,147 --> 00:47:16,410
Those girls whom you're
always looking for on Facebook.

948
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,617
Like, 'Who was she?

949
00:47:17,697 --> 00:47:19,376
What was her name again?
Neha Sharma?'

950
00:47:19,456 --> 00:47:20,657
Ten lakh people pop up!

951
00:47:23,688 --> 00:47:25,550
She was in a different school,
I was in a different one.

952
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:27,084
And she had a boyfriend!

953
00:47:27,552 --> 00:47:29,713
The things that are sweet
about a small town is...

954
00:47:30,218 --> 00:47:32,378
that you'd know
everything about everyone.

955
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,020
During our time, we'd look
at the scooty's number plate

956
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,825
and tell you their family history.

957
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:44,270
So she had a boyfriend.

958
00:47:44,691 --> 00:47:48,217
He was such a disgusting guy
that I can't even elaborate!

959
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:49,430
But that's the thing,

960
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,418
the heart wants what it wants,
there's no logic to it!

961
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:56,497
I remember during eleventh grade,
there was this chemistry coaching class.

962
00:47:56,842 --> 00:47:58,264
I always hung out outside.

963
00:47:58,816 --> 00:48:00,653
I saw her coming out of the class
and they were fighting,

964
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:02,240
and the boy slapped her!

965
00:48:03,233 --> 00:48:04,870
I was like, "What an asshole!"

966
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:08,013
And such a beautiful,
lovely girl. You...

967
00:48:09,033 --> 00:48:10,989
It's the same thing, the time
when I'd broken up the first time,

968
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:13,589
the break up story I told
you earlier, and when I saw her...

969
00:48:14,918 --> 00:48:17,275
When you admire someone so
much and something bad happens to them,

970
00:48:17,355 --> 00:48:19,212
your heart breaks too.

971
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:23,646
I just thought,
'But you were from a fairyland, right?

972
00:48:26,323 --> 00:48:28,110
How could this happen to you?'

973
00:48:29,129 --> 00:48:30,747
But that's the problem
with our generation, see?

974
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:33,039
We are a generation of
broken hearts and broken people.

975
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:39,467
You feel your life is bad,

976
00:48:39,547 --> 00:48:41,179
but the other person's is worse!

977
00:48:45,595 --> 00:48:47,073
But I couldn't bear it...

978
00:48:48,252 --> 00:48:51,874
That day, I mustered
the courage to go up to her.

979
00:48:51,954 --> 00:48:54,362
She was crying alone
and no one was talking to her

980
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:56,308
and her boyfriend had
also left after slapping her...

981
00:48:56,907 --> 00:48:58,675
And I walked up to her and I said,

982
00:48:59,984 --> 00:49:08,067
"Excuse me, please don't cry and I
want to tell you that you deserve better

983
00:49:09,096 --> 00:49:11,332
and I don't think you
should talk to that guy.'

984
00:49:12,427 --> 00:49:15,888
I said what I wanted to,
without any malice or agenda.

985
00:49:16,692 --> 00:49:17,431
She stopped crying.

986
00:49:17,511 --> 00:49:19,602
She looked at me and she said,

987
00:49:21,257 --> 00:49:22,838
"FUCK OFF, YOU CREEP!"

988
00:49:29,723 --> 00:49:31,547
That day,
I learnt an important life lesson,

989
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:35,719
that intentions don't
matter if you're ugly!

990
00:49:41,118 --> 00:49:42,559
My childhood crush!

991
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:45,309
She said 'Hi' to me, upfront.

992
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:49,312
And I knew that I had to win this game.

993
00:49:49,615 --> 00:49:50,370
Whatever happens!

994
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:51,549
And that guy, was an asshole.

995
00:49:51,629 --> 00:49:56,386
The worse he'd get, the more she'd
worship him and this kept happening!

996
00:49:56,676 --> 00:49:58,613
But how long can an asshole last?

997
00:49:59,398 --> 00:50:00,951
He messed it up in college!

998
00:50:01,831 --> 00:50:03,159
She got angry!

999
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:04,993
I'd kept myself updated!

1000
00:50:05,731 --> 00:50:06,957
So, she sent me a 'Hi'.

1001
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:09,081
I wrote back...

1002
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,120
I am a doctor at this stuff!

1003
00:50:12,645 --> 00:50:16,986
I wrote back saying, 'So, is that how
you want to start this conversation?'

1004
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:21,384
Now, isn't that a moment?

1005
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,806
Isn't it? It is a moment.

1006
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:26,575
She said, 'Oh.'

1007
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:28,782
'Oh' is victory.

1008
00:50:34,089 --> 00:50:35,770
We got a reaction, we got a reaction!

1009
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,693
But this is just a
pass to run the marathon!

1010
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:42,143
The run hasn't been won yet!

1011
00:50:42,450 --> 00:50:43,985
The long fight is yet remaining!

1012
00:50:44,468 --> 00:50:47,289
She said, 'Okay.
Tell me something nice.'

1013
00:50:48,575 --> 00:50:49,598
Challenge?

1014
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:52,478
Now, your brother is a...

1015
00:50:52,726 --> 00:50:53,618
Warrior!

1016
00:50:56,234 --> 00:50:58,763
So, I replied with a poem!

1017
00:50:59,582 --> 00:51:00,327
I wrote to her...

1018
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:01,234
Many people have heard it.

1019
00:51:01,314 --> 00:51:02,520
It's an original.

1020
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:04,507
Listen to it again.

1021
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,767
I wrote to her...

1022
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:10,173
She breezed into my life like a butterfly;

1023
00:51:14,169 --> 00:51:15,790
She breezed into my life like a butterfly;

1024
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,340
Blossomed my barren life

1025
00:51:17,602 --> 00:51:20,657
Soothed my strife and
Sanctified me whole again.

1026
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:27,980
It's a moment.. It's a moment, right?

1027
00:51:28,857 --> 00:51:30,641
An intellectual win for the boy, right?

1028
00:51:31,884 --> 00:51:33,813
We began talking, exchanged numbers.
Things went ahead!

1029
00:51:33,893 --> 00:51:34,822
What then?

1030
00:51:34,902 --> 00:51:36,517
Your brother knows how to close...

1031
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:46,033
Okay, so our affair began.

1032
00:51:46,113 --> 00:51:48,204
A few months in, we're chilling...

1033
00:51:48,284 --> 00:51:49,157
I introduced her to my friends.

1034
00:51:49,237 --> 00:51:52,355
More than that... For the first time
it felt like I'm with someone for real.

1035
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:54,127
You're getting it, right?

1036
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:57,124
She texted one day, I was alone at home.

1037
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:59,426
She texted saying, 'Hey, uhm...

1038
00:51:59,506 --> 00:52:00,830
just wanted to check with you,

1039
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:03,884
would you be interested
if we move in together?'

1040
00:52:07,942 --> 00:52:11,703
(Audience) Stay firm, stay firm!

1041
00:52:12,798 --> 00:52:13,771
I asked,

1042
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:16,474
'What do you mean move in?'

1043
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:19,653
Confirm...

1044
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:23,913
She said, "I mean...

1045
00:52:25,863 --> 00:52:27,212
Move in as in move in!"

1046
00:52:31,056 --> 00:52:33,277
I replied, "What an explanation!"

1047
00:52:35,442 --> 00:52:38,117
What an explanatory statement!

1048
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:40,455
Move in as in move in!"

1049
00:52:40,675 --> 00:52:41,830
She said, "No, as in...

1050
00:52:42,969 --> 00:52:45,761
I'm saying, like,
you come stay at my place."

1051
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:48,466
I thought,
'She's talking about marriage...'

1052
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,895
So, I said, "Eid is in two months.

1053
00:52:53,948 --> 00:52:57,003
I'll talk to my mother...
When I go home."

1054
00:52:57,690 --> 00:52:59,049
She said,
"Oh, no... Don't involve your family.

1055
00:52:59,129 --> 00:53:03,420
I'm just asking if you'd like to
be in a live-in relationship with me?"

1056
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:08,579
Look...

1057
00:53:10,789 --> 00:53:12,221
As such I'm a firm dude...

1058
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:19,574
But I had to melt here.

1059
00:53:22,717 --> 00:53:23,638
And there are a few words...

1060
00:53:23,718 --> 00:53:26,634
Words have a specific function...
Right?

1061
00:53:26,714 --> 00:53:28,272
Till the particular word isn't used,

1062
00:53:28,352 --> 00:53:29,558
it's not fun until then!

1063
00:53:30,216 --> 00:53:31,882
I mean, you just can't
get that feel without that word!

1064
00:53:32,101 --> 00:53:33,662
Like move in, staying together...

1065
00:53:34,747 --> 00:53:35,989
Live-in relationship!

1066
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:39,907
I mean, my body
could feel the pressure.

1067
00:53:39,987 --> 00:53:41,646
My body couldn't bear it!

1068
00:53:41,726 --> 00:53:43,166
My knees gave in!

1069
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,870
I was in shock, I sat down for support!

1070
00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:47,902
I actually sat down on the ground!

1071
00:53:48,955 --> 00:53:51,429
I held my head. I thought,
is this really happening to me?

1072
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:57,536
I couldn't believe
the movement of my life!

1073
00:53:57,989 --> 00:54:00,547
Because a few days ago,
I was watching Roadies on TV!

1074
00:54:07,037 --> 00:54:09,844
I mean, I was in this delusion
that I can easily win Roadies.

1075
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,268
And now... What? Live in, live in?

1076
00:54:14,524 --> 00:54:16,314
Like, I didn't have a girl
in my life and now, live in?!

1077
00:54:18,876 --> 00:54:21,712
I thought, 'Am I the one
who is living the American Dream?'

1078
00:54:23,949 --> 00:54:25,673
My friend came in and asked,
"Why are you sitting on the floor?"

1079
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:27,954
I said, "Just look,
what your bhabhi has sent!"

1080
00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:31,111
Dude, he couldn't take it either,
he sat down too!

1081
00:54:40,097 --> 00:54:42,743
So, I took my belongings
and reached her place!

1082
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,886
I shifted... For the first
time in my life, I did this too!

1083
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:47,977
I did THIS too!

1084
00:54:48,942 --> 00:54:50,754
You know what I mean...

1085
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:53,137
And it was the most beautiful
relationship of my life...

1086
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:56,119
Because it was almost like
prince and princess living together!

1087
00:54:57,463 --> 00:54:59,963
But our kingdoms were different!

1088
00:55:03,895 --> 00:55:08,368
She was the princess of a kingdom
called, 'I'll Clean Everything.'

1089
00:55:11,862 --> 00:55:14,996
And your brother's the
Sultan of a sultanate

1090
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:18,513
called, 'I'm Going To Do Nothing.'

1091
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:27,283
And then, we would fight!

1092
00:55:27,794 --> 00:55:28,964
She used to just have
one question for me,

1093
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:30,172
"Tell me one thing!

1094
00:55:30,252 --> 00:55:32,267
Why can't you drink water
and keep the glass on the coaster?"

1095
00:55:33,192 --> 00:55:34,701
And my question to her would be,

1096
00:55:35,776 --> 00:55:36,843
"What in the hell is a coaster?"

1097
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:44,546
Come on, there is a difference
in our upbringing.

1098
00:55:44,626 --> 00:55:46,607
She knew about this stuff
because she was brought up that way

1099
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,078
and I didn't because it was not
a part of my upbringing.

1100
00:55:49,282 --> 00:55:51,175
Because in my house,
with my mother,

1101
00:55:51,255 --> 00:55:53,755
my two brothers and
leaving my father aside,

1102
00:55:53,835 --> 00:55:56,035
basically there are
three people who do my work!

1103
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:00,815
And mummy, she still does everything.

1104
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:03,622
And we didn't tell her that
feminism has come into the world.

1105
00:56:11,588 --> 00:56:15,608
That's a secret between dad,
me and my two brothers. It's our secret.

1106
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:17,669
We didn't tell her that outside...

1107
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:20,621
We didn't let her know that
people are talking about equality.

1108
00:56:23,208 --> 00:56:24,197
If something came up on TV, like,

1109
00:56:24,277 --> 00:56:26,176
"Females are..."
We'd change the channel.

1110
00:56:28,237 --> 00:56:31,467
I'm like, 'We don't need to go there!
No risk at all.'

1111
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,786
So, she still does everything...

1112
00:56:35,428 --> 00:56:38,995
One day, I was at home on my laptop,
she suddenly opens the door and says,

1113
00:56:39,638 --> 00:56:41,041
"Just tell me one thing..."

1114
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:42,182
I said, "What?"

1115
00:56:47,473 --> 00:56:49,549
She says, "Mr. Zakir Khan!"

1116
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:54,132
Bro, when the girlfriend says
your full name,

1117
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,325
the stitches come undone on their own!

1118
00:57:02,616 --> 00:57:06,636
I thought, 'Better shut
the laptop and handle this.'

1119
00:57:07,971 --> 00:57:09,782
She says, "Uh, by the way"

1120
00:57:09,862 --> 00:57:12,425
She's very calm, composed.
She's very poised.

1121
00:57:12,505 --> 00:57:15,144
She says, "Am I loud?
Am I shouting at you?"

1122
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:16,371
I say, "No, no no..."

1123
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,159
"Calm down.

1124
00:57:21,955 --> 00:57:25,207
Just one question.

1125
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:28,015
After eating...

1126
00:57:29,684 --> 00:57:33,546
Where do we keep the plates?"

1127
00:57:49,918 --> 00:57:52,341
I said, "After eating...

1128
00:57:52,421 --> 00:57:53,865
We slide the plates under the bed."

1129
00:58:01,276 --> 00:58:03,586
She says, "Man,
you don't help at all..."

1130
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:05,106
"You know how many
dishes I have to clean?!"

1131
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:06,656
I said, "But we have a maid for that!"

1132
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:09,637
She says, "But she doesn't do
them right, so I have to do them again.

1133
00:58:09,717 --> 00:58:10,734
She doesn't work properly!"

1134
00:58:10,814 --> 00:58:11,815
I said, "Then fire her!"

1135
00:58:11,895 --> 00:58:13,014
She said, "No, we can't!"

1136
00:58:13,394 --> 00:58:14,505
I said, "Huh?

1137
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,908
The maid comes here to wash the dishes.

1138
00:58:16,988 --> 00:58:18,422
If she doesn't do that right,
then fire her.

1139
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:19,240
Isn't that simple?"

1140
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,053
She said, "No no,
there's a tuning between us."

1141
00:58:22,368 --> 00:58:24,646
I said, "You want her to do the dishes

1142
00:58:24,726 --> 00:58:26,694
or do you want to sit and compose music?

1143
00:58:28,317 --> 00:58:31,240
What? You want to hold hands
and sing 'Kun Faya Kun'?"

1144
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:35,377
She says, "You don't understand
anything, just shut up!"

1145
00:58:35,457 --> 00:58:37,469
I said, "Okay, then, I don't understand.

1146
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:39,382
Fine, wash the washed dishes!"

1147
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:43,606
One day, there was a big fuss over

1148
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,683
mom and dad coming home.

1149
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,047
She started cleaning the whole house,
using phenyl everywhere!

1150
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:53,561
Put me to work too
and I'm pushing sofas.

1151
00:58:53,912 --> 00:58:55,768
She used to wash curtains!

1152
00:58:58,517 --> 00:58:59,550
I just went, "What are you saying?

1153
00:58:59,630 --> 00:59:02,068
What? Huh? Huh?

1154
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,933
Curtains are supposed to be washed?"

1155
00:59:10,503 --> 00:59:12,214
So, she's going all
out to clean everything.

1156
00:59:12,294 --> 00:59:14,275
I said, "They'll be here by 12,
you leave now."

1157
00:59:14,612 --> 00:59:19,880
So they are supposed to come by 12
and I had her leave by 11...

1158
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,877
They were actually coming by 2 pm.

1159
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:25,370
I had to do this!

1160
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:28,514
The moment she left the house,
I went down with a bucket.

1161
00:59:28,594 --> 00:59:29,566
I filled it up with dust.

1162
00:59:32,563 --> 00:59:34,609
I came back...
Sprinkled it all across the room.

1163
00:59:37,415 --> 00:59:39,344
Okay, now everything was normal.

1164
00:59:40,397 --> 00:59:43,437
Mom and dad came... Now, mothers and
fathers look at you very differently.

1165
00:59:44,051 --> 00:59:46,634
Fathers look at you
three years ahead in time.

1166
00:59:47,525 --> 00:59:48,816
As in, 'He's having a great time.'

1167
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:53,317
And mothers look at you
ten years in the past,

1168
00:59:53,397 --> 00:59:55,029
"You didn't bathe today, did you?"

1169
00:59:59,922 --> 01:00:01,909
My mother came, she lost it
looking at the state of the house!

1170
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:04,489
She said, "What is this dust?
Why is there a brick in the house?"

1171
01:00:04,569 --> 01:00:06,624
I thought, 'It's here by mistake, oh man!

1172
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:07,802
There was a brick in all the dust!'

1173
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:09,200
"What do you do with a brick?"

1174
01:00:09,229 --> 01:00:10,017
I said, "Nothing!"

1175
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,791
And my father is taking a read
of the house...

1176
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,382
He says, "Tell me one thing..."

1177
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,186
I say, "Yes?"

1178
01:00:21,506 --> 01:00:22,990
"Your room is quite well-decorated?"

1179
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:33,194
"I, the uh...

1180
01:00:35,237 --> 01:00:36,421
The maid does it..."

1181
01:00:38,818 --> 01:00:41,582
"Okay, okay, kay..."

1182
01:00:42,564 --> 01:00:43,967
Dad says, "Actually...

1183
01:00:45,128 --> 01:00:48,320
Your kitchen is also set quite well!"

1184
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,932
"Yeah, the maid does it."

1185
01:00:53,012 --> 01:00:54,621
Straight face,
I wanted to laugh but...

1186
01:00:56,928 --> 01:00:57,752
"The maid does it."

1187
01:01:03,324 --> 01:01:07,366
Dad is also saying,
"Okay, okay, okay..."

1188
01:01:09,285 --> 01:01:11,089
A little while later, I got caught.

1189
01:01:11,169 --> 01:01:12,565
He came out of the bathroom and said,

1190
01:01:12,677 --> 01:01:13,585
"Tell me one thing,

1191
01:01:13,942 --> 01:01:16,592
since when did you start
keeping the seat up to pee?"

1192
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:25,866
I fumbled,
"That ba-ta-cha-pa-la-da-ra..."

1193
01:01:26,323 --> 01:01:27,853
I said, "That's the right way..."

1194
01:01:27,933 --> 01:01:29,268
He came to me and said,

1195
01:01:29,348 --> 01:01:32,009
"Look, I've stayed out too!

1196
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,516
I understand the difference
between a maid and a girlfriend!"

1197
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:42,972
And I'm playing it stubborn!

1198
01:01:43,393 --> 01:01:45,439
I was full, like,
"What are you saying, huh? Meaning?

1199
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:48,760
No, no I didn't understand...
what do you mean? Huh, huh?

1200
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:50,924
I don't know what you're saying?"

1201
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:52,738
He held my elbow and pulled me,

1202
01:01:52,818 --> 01:01:55,531
That dominant gesture fathers do,
he pulled me closer and said,

1203
01:01:55,835 --> 01:02:01,179
"Listen, I've had and raised three kids,
and made you all able to face the world!"

1204
01:02:05,962 --> 01:02:08,347
Okay, okay, okay!

1205
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,407
That day, I didn't say anything.

1206
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:13,301
But in a few days,

1207
01:02:13,672 --> 01:02:15,727
I had a bit more respect for my father.

1208
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,993
Whatever you say...

1209
01:02:19,722 --> 01:02:21,305
My dad is a stud!

1210
01:02:27,105 --> 01:02:28,766
So everything went well.
I introduced her to my folks!

1211
01:02:28,988 --> 01:02:31,923
We had their blessings
to tie the knot in two years.

1212
01:02:32,765 --> 01:02:33,970
We had their consent.

1213
01:02:34,988 --> 01:02:36,695
Great, super!

1214
01:02:36,882 --> 01:02:39,069
One day, a few months later...

1215
01:02:39,268 --> 01:02:40,391
She comes to me in the morning.

1216
01:02:40,471 --> 01:02:41,886
And tells me, "Baby...

1217
01:02:43,101 --> 01:02:44,284
Listen..."

1218
01:02:46,004 --> 01:02:49,126
Whether it's a boy or a girl,
my brain is formatted to notice

1219
01:02:49,418 --> 01:02:51,769
sing-song conversations, you know?

1220
01:02:53,407 --> 01:02:55,334
It usually means red alert!

1221
01:02:56,236 --> 01:02:57,897
Saying, "No, dude, something is wrong!"

1222
01:02:58,447 --> 01:03:01,406
For instance, if a guy comes
to me and says, "Dude..."

1223
01:03:02,961 --> 01:03:04,622
I say, "There goes my 2000 bucks,
motherfucker!"

1224
01:03:12,784 --> 01:03:14,562
I said, "Yeah, tell me?"

1225
01:03:16,035 --> 01:03:19,134
She says, "Actually,
my school's having a reunion!"

1226
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:23,776
"Okay, okay, okay, okay!"

1227
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:26,501
And adds, "Rahul is also coming..."

1228
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:33,938
"Okay, okay, okay, okay!"

1229
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:35,997
"So, should I go?"

1230
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:38,219
I said, "Yeah!"

1231
01:03:39,587 --> 01:03:41,119
She asked, "You don't have a problem?"

1232
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:43,178
I said, "No..."
- "What, really?"

1233
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:44,885
I said, "Yeah!"

1234
01:03:45,225 --> 01:03:46,244
I said, "Look...

1235
01:03:46,767 --> 01:03:48,677
You're not a kite, you're a bird.

1236
01:03:49,189 --> 01:03:50,862
No string should tie you down...

1237
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:56,615
And secondly,

1238
01:03:57,071 --> 01:04:00,439
I am playing the role of
being modern and understanding.

1239
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:03,842
So I can't even say no!"

1240
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:08,941
One thing I can tell on behalf
of all the men in the world,

1241
01:04:09,432 --> 01:04:11,774
I swear on the soil of this earth

1242
01:04:11,854 --> 01:04:15,876
that we are all pretending
to be understanding!

1243
01:04:19,185 --> 01:04:21,080
We're not, not for shit!

1244
01:04:22,144 --> 01:04:25,850
Because, we know very well
who is truly a friend

1245
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:28,657
and who is truly not a friend.

1246
01:04:29,277 --> 01:04:30,245
Because....

1247
01:04:31,514 --> 01:04:33,276
We are also someone's 'friend'!

1248
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,948
And we know how friendly we are!

1249
01:04:44,281 --> 01:04:46,971
Okay, the day of the reunion arrived.

1250
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:50,456
She left the house at 9.
I got up at 10 to an empty home!

1251
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:53,379
I got so irritated!

1252
01:04:53,905 --> 01:04:55,835
I took off my t-shirt
and slammed it in the hall!

1253
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,395
Slammed my jeans in the bedroom!

1254
01:04:59,085 --> 01:05:00,231
Underwear in the kitchen!

1255
01:05:01,915 --> 01:05:03,786
I thought, 'The world should know

1256
01:05:04,385 --> 01:05:06,230
that Emperor Ashok has graced every room!"

1257
01:05:10,556 --> 01:05:11,574
I was like, what to do?
What to do? What to do?

1258
01:05:11,654 --> 01:05:12,860
I couldn't think of anything

1259
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:16,883
I put on the match that Mohammad Kaif
and Yuvraj Singh won us in England,

1260
01:05:17,795 --> 01:05:18,745
the NatWest series one?

1261
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:19,922
I put that on!

1262
01:05:21,194 --> 01:05:24,347
It was 10, then 10:30,
then 11, then 12...

1263
01:05:24,427 --> 01:05:25,629
Not one text from her...

1264
01:05:26,350 --> 01:05:27,716
It was 2 o'clock already!

1265
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,616
Now, if you leave a man alone,
what will he do?

1266
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,563
Look...

1267
01:05:44,081 --> 01:05:45,987
Many of you might think, 'For what?'

1268
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:51,590
So, I'd like to tell that you
go to office and make new friends...

1269
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:54,875
But that doesn't mean you
forget your old school friends!

1270
01:05:58,995 --> 01:06:02,595
And after all, these new friends
weren't really like what we'd expected!

1271
01:06:07,707 --> 01:06:09,218
After that, I slept!

1272
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:17,503
Those who understood, understood!

1273
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:26,739
It's 4 o'clock, she still hasn't texted!

1274
01:06:27,375 --> 01:06:28,221
And I'm getting stressed!

1275
01:06:28,301 --> 01:06:31,634
I was pacing in the house,
like a worried father...

1276
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:35,106
And this is how my heart
was reassuring me...

1277
01:06:35,186 --> 01:06:36,999
'They've met in school,
what could possibly happen?'

1278
01:06:37,305 --> 01:06:39,970
And when you really love someone
you tend to think they're dead.

1279
01:06:42,383 --> 01:06:43,047
Alright?

1280
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:46,537
But she was alive because photos were
constantly being uploaded on Facebook!

1281
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,792
I thought, 'She is alive!
She's just not texting!'

1282
01:06:51,373 --> 01:06:52,889
It was 5 o'clock, then 6!

1283
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:55,845
Photos are still being uploaded. I got
really irritated, this was the limit!

1284
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:58,750
I picked my phone and began
typing all the swear words.

1285
01:06:58,830 --> 01:06:59,877
Everything on my mind!

1286
01:06:59,957 --> 01:07:01,295
Dude, here I was watching
the NatWest series

1287
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:02,900
and now I started
watching Hannah Montana!

1288
01:07:03,554 --> 01:07:05,304
That was half the reason
why I was so pissed!

1289
01:07:06,547 --> 01:07:08,072
I typed out all my bad thoughts.

1290
01:07:08,152 --> 01:07:11,140
I typed, 'I know everything about
the reunion you're having with Rahul!

1291
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,219
Keep talking to him.
Don't think I don't get it.

1292
01:07:13,299 --> 01:07:14,480
Don't ever think I'm stupid.

1293
01:07:15,051 --> 01:07:17,661
I've also had relationships!'

1294
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,534
'S'!

1295
01:07:23,593 --> 01:07:25,817
I wrote an 8-paragraph
text and then...

1296
01:07:25,897 --> 01:07:26,493
deleted it!

1297
01:07:34,912 --> 01:07:37,027
Still angry, I typed another text!

1298
01:07:37,233 --> 01:07:38,015
I wrote...

1299
01:07:38,711 --> 01:07:39,281
'Where are you?'

1300
01:07:43,248 --> 01:07:44,474
And just as I hit the space key,

1301
01:07:44,554 --> 01:07:46,185
it was auto-corrected to
'wherever you are.'

1302
01:07:50,357 --> 01:07:52,976
Now, I don't know how to edit
a single alphabet on an iPhone

1303
01:07:53,259 --> 01:07:54,283
and who's going to delete
the whole sentence

1304
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:56,250
and type it up all over again.
So to 'wherever you are',

1305
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:58,938
I added a comma and wrote...

1306
01:07:59,018 --> 01:08:00,063
'Where ever you are,

1307
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:03,695
you are mine.'

1308
01:08:06,662 --> 01:08:08,328
That's a moment, right? It's a moment?

1309
01:08:10,462 --> 01:08:12,162
And as soon as I sent
the 'where are you' text,

1310
01:08:12,242 --> 01:08:13,785
I felt bad for myself

1311
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:16,441
because it was almost 8...

1312
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:19,993
For the past 12 hours,
I'd just been waiting for her.

1313
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:22,566
I'd just been waiting.

1314
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,612
I hadn't even eaten anything.

1315
01:08:24,831 --> 01:08:27,389
You know, you don't feel as insulted
when lose your dignity before others,

1316
01:08:27,469 --> 01:08:29,845
but when you're alone and you fall
in your own eyes, it hurts more.

1317
01:08:30,957 --> 01:08:33,763
To have your self-esteem lowered
in your own eyes is really sad.

1318
01:08:38,484 --> 01:08:41,963
But! If you ever feel like
your self-esteem is dropping,

1319
01:08:42,357 --> 01:08:43,418
eat something!

1320
01:08:45,007 --> 01:08:47,948
There is some relation between
self-esteem and your stomach being full!

1321
01:08:49,721 --> 01:08:50,945
So first, I went to the kitchen...

1322
01:08:51,025 --> 01:08:52,308
And I made Maggi

1323
01:08:53,609 --> 01:08:54,604
because that's the only thing I know!

1324
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:58,017
Now I don't have this life skill,
what do I do?

1325
01:09:00,282 --> 01:09:02,748
Second, I thought that this
wasn't enough to elevate my self-esteem!

1326
01:09:02,828 --> 01:09:03,991
I had to do something else!

1327
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:05,438
So, on my laptop,

1328
01:09:06,069 --> 01:09:09,235
I began watching Gangs of Wasseypur!

1329
01:09:12,579 --> 01:09:14,808
And then, the stress of my life
just changed!

1330
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:19,340
Earlier I was thinking about
how she hasn't texted and stuff!

1331
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:22,666
And now, I was just frustrated
that Perpendicular has been murdered,

1332
01:09:22,746 --> 01:09:24,201
it was Qureshi who
did it and now Samsad...

1333
01:09:24,281 --> 01:09:26,814
That asshole's been
stealing and selling iron.

1334
01:09:26,894 --> 01:09:29,719
So Faizal rebuked him
and now he's gone to complain.

1335
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:32,130
He filed an FIR and now the
police are here to arrest Faizal!

1336
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,103
Here, Faizal is getting arrested,
Perpendicular is lying dead,

1337
01:09:34,183 --> 01:09:35,748
I'm just in agony!

1338
01:09:35,828 --> 01:09:37,381
I think, 'Ramadhir will die,
when he dies,

1339
01:09:37,461 --> 01:09:40,758
but that fuckface Qureshi and
Samsad should go to jail, motherfuckers!'

1340
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,698
Dude, I'm on another trip today,
just furious!

1341
01:09:50,961 --> 01:09:52,563
Please, I feel some of
you didn't really understand

1342
01:09:52,643 --> 01:09:54,265
the Gangs of Wasseypur reference

1343
01:09:54,703 --> 01:09:56,121
but I'd like to tell those people...

1344
01:09:56,201 --> 01:09:57,319
I don't care.

1345
01:10:00,374 --> 01:10:01,456
Yes!

1346
01:10:02,684 --> 01:10:04,569
Because I too don't
understand 'Game of Thrones'!

1347
01:10:07,523 --> 01:10:11,509
The White-walkers, the Lannisters
and the Dragons!

1348
01:10:11,589 --> 01:10:15,738
Your Faizal will avenge them all!

1349
01:10:22,082 --> 01:10:24,274
In my opinion, there are
two kinds of people in the world.

1350
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:27,800
One, those who like
Gangs of Wasseypur.

1351
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,472
And others who
work for Ramadhir Singh!

1352
01:10:36,772 --> 01:10:38,965
This is my side of the story!

1353
01:10:39,886 --> 01:10:41,552
Now, I'll tell you her side...

1354
01:10:43,554 --> 01:10:45,556
Look, what happened is
she was thinking of me,

1355
01:10:45,994 --> 01:10:46,976
she loves me,

1356
01:10:48,137 --> 01:10:49,956
but what happened is
when you meet people...

1357
01:10:50,036 --> 01:10:52,148
This happens with
guys too... A lot of times!

1358
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:53,100
It's happened with me.

1359
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,223
That's how I know!

1360
01:10:54,531 --> 01:10:55,730
So, you meet people,

1361
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,199
you get together with friends
then the talking, laughing starts!

1362
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:02,410
Then comes this guy, Rahul!

1363
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,403
And she starts talking
about the mistakes of the past.

1364
01:11:08,483 --> 01:11:09,250
Nothing's wrong with it!

1365
01:11:09,287 --> 01:11:12,642
Especially with two people who'd been
together for years, what's the harm...

1366
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,601
But by then it was too late to call me.

1367
01:11:14,681 --> 01:11:16,827
I was playing modern and
understanding...

1368
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:18,723
So I didn't call her!

1369
01:11:18,803 --> 01:11:23,006
And it was too late
for us to call each other as well!

1370
01:11:24,043 --> 01:11:28,019
So by 3 o'clock she had
devised her Plan B,

1371
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:30,430
which was for every,
'Where are you?' question.

1372
01:11:30,991 --> 01:11:32,460
She had prepared all the

1373
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:34,350
permutations and combinations
of a response text.

1374
01:11:35,201 --> 01:11:37,484
She was mentally prepared for it!

1375
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,000
Like, how to reply if I'm angry,

1376
01:11:39,014 --> 01:11:40,400
how to reply if I ask her nicely.

1377
01:11:40,465 --> 01:11:41,651
What to reply if I don't message.

1378
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:42,851
What to reply if
she gets the silent treatment!

1379
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,100
She was fully prepared for it.

1380
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,012
But...

1381
01:11:48,163 --> 01:11:51,321
She wasn't prepared for
'wherever you are, you're mine.'

1382
01:11:56,431 --> 01:11:57,232
Dude...

1383
01:11:59,904 --> 01:12:01,492
Half an hour later, she calls me

1384
01:12:02,826 --> 01:12:04,387
with a full guilty conscience!

1385
01:12:06,819 --> 01:12:08,456
A phone call drenched in tears!

1386
01:12:09,795 --> 01:12:15,914
Now it's almost 9 and I've been
waiting for her, for 12 hours now...

1387
01:12:15,994 --> 01:12:18,412
But life takes such strange turns...

1388
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:21,564
Right now, she was the
most irrelevant person for me.

1389
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:24,473
Because Faizal had loaded
the ambulance with guns...

1390
01:12:25,194 --> 01:12:26,577
The election was happening
at the same time!

1391
01:12:26,657 --> 01:12:29,169
And it's still not clear
whose side Definite is on!

1392
01:12:29,249 --> 01:12:31,153
Whether he's with
Ramadhir or with Faizal.

1393
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:33,117
Is he going to shoot?
What will he do or won't do?

1394
01:12:33,197 --> 01:12:35,970
And then admitted in the hospital,
is Ramadhir of course

1395
01:12:36,050 --> 01:12:38,178
but there's that asshole Samsad as well!

1396
01:12:38,375 --> 01:12:40,546
And Samsad is really smart,
don't you dare underestimate him!

1397
01:12:40,705 --> 01:12:41,775
Definite fucking bombed him.

1398
01:12:41,855 --> 01:12:43,783
His leg was cut off
but the motherfucker survived!

1399
01:12:43,863 --> 01:12:45,214
But he will die today!

1400
01:12:51,248 --> 01:12:54,784
Finally she calls,
the phone's ringing.

1401
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,758
But on TV...'Teri keh ke lunga!'

1402
01:13:01,832 --> 01:13:03,687
I don't think any other guy
would have done

1403
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:05,011
what I did that day!

1404
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:10,894
It's a moment, right, it's a moment?

1405
01:13:12,475 --> 01:13:15,127
I picked up the phone,
she is full of guilt conscience.

1406
01:13:15,624 --> 01:13:16,975
And she's just sobbing,
crying on the call!

1407
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,564
So much so that her teardrops
were splashing on my face!

1408
01:13:22,072 --> 01:13:22,988
I said, "Hello?"

1409
01:13:25,185 --> 01:13:26,119
What had I written?

1410
01:13:26,753 --> 01:13:28,502
(Audience) Wherever you are, you are mine.

1411
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,621
She says, "Till I die!

1412
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,765
Till my very last breath!

1413
01:13:37,382 --> 01:13:38,737
As long as I am alive and breathing,

1414
01:13:38,979 --> 01:13:41,830
I am only and only yours!"

1415
01:13:46,075 --> 01:13:48,021
I said, "Okay, no problem,
come back soon!"

1416
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,253
She said, "What? Really?
You're really not angry?"

1417
01:13:53,333 --> 01:13:55,171
I said, "Yes, I'm not angry,
come home soon!"

1418
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:57,229
She asked, "Are you sure?
Sure you love me?"

1419
01:13:57,309 --> 01:13:58,867
I said, "Yeah I love you,
I love you very much.

1420
01:13:58,947 --> 01:14:00,457
We'll get married soon,
just come home fast now!"

1421
01:14:00,654 --> 01:14:01,935
She says, "Okay I'm coming home!"

1422
01:14:02,015 --> 01:14:02,674
I said, "Okay."

1423
01:14:02,754 --> 01:14:04,760
I said, "Kill! Kill him!

1424
01:14:05,272 --> 01:14:06,819
Kill him some more!

1425
01:14:07,155 --> 01:14:09,775
Go get more guns. Kill him!
Kill him more!"

1426
01:14:17,128 --> 01:14:19,729
Whatever happened...
Good, bad, fair, unfair,

1427
01:14:19,809 --> 01:14:21,497
The wedding is in January, next year!

1428
01:14:29,356 --> 01:14:30,319
Hers!

1429
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:53,723
No... I just wanted to say...

1430
01:14:53,803 --> 01:14:56,290
If you weren't sure,
you shouldn't have met the parents.

1431
01:14:59,292 --> 01:15:00,938
Whatever happened, was it wrong?

1432
01:15:01,298 --> 01:15:02,982
Yes. Whatever happened
with me was wrong!

1433
01:15:04,052 --> 01:15:05,668
But did I make any mistakes?

1434
01:15:06,574 --> 01:15:07,570
Of course!

1435
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:12,030
Of course I made mistakes!

1436
01:15:13,496 --> 01:15:16,587
See, girls look at relationships
like a car.

1437
01:15:17,859 --> 01:15:19,847
Girls view a relationship like a car

1438
01:15:19,927 --> 01:15:22,125
and we view it as a plane.

1439
01:15:24,062 --> 01:15:26,943
They want a driver and
we think of ourselves as pilots!

1440
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:32,788
They don't want over commitment,

1441
01:15:32,953 --> 01:15:35,640
they want you to drive at the speed
of 50 but with attention,

1442
01:15:35,887 --> 01:15:38,656
be cautious about the turns,
keep your eye on the bumps along the way...

1443
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:40,191
And we're like, "Are you crazy?

1444
01:15:41,882 --> 01:15:45,167
Just watch how I take this relationship
from 0 to 800 in 10 seconds!

1445
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:47,323
Look at the unnecessary commitment,

1446
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,010
how I'm going to take it to
5 lakh kilometres above the sea level."

1447
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:53,101
And then I feel, 'Now,
why isn't this flying on auto-mode?'

1448
01:15:54,957 --> 01:15:56,573
Because lack of emotional understanding,

1449
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,898
it causes us to over-commit.

1450
01:15:57,978 --> 01:16:01,109
And then we wonder, 'Why
do they just keep crying, these women?'

1451
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:02,583
Because of you, fuckface!

1452
01:16:12,207 --> 01:16:12,964
When we break up,

1453
01:16:13,044 --> 01:16:14,781
you don't realise that
you've broken up...

1454
01:16:14,931 --> 01:16:17,857
In the beginning,
you're upset, with everything.

1455
01:16:19,389 --> 01:16:21,287
"She will never find anyone!

1456
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:24,107
She'll come running back to me,
you just watch!"

1457
01:16:25,472 --> 01:16:26,840
For 5-6 days when there is no answer,

1458
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:28,304
you take a moral high ground!

1459
01:16:28,915 --> 01:16:33,070
That, one shouldn't keep
these small egos and issues in love.

1460
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:34,920
Crazy talks!

1461
01:16:37,135 --> 01:16:40,841
Now, the signal at home is quite weak
so I'm not being able to call her...

1462
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:41,721
I said, 'No problem...'

1463
01:16:42,943 --> 01:16:44,644
So I texted her on WhatsApp

1464
01:16:45,492 --> 01:16:47,457
but here too she's taken off
her DP and all...

1465
01:16:47,537 --> 01:16:49,020
I'm like, 'What a crazy girl!'

1466
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:51,145
She's doing all these
antics after a small fight!

1467
01:16:51,225 --> 01:16:53,246
And this was not the time of Jio,

1468
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,103
that everyone had internet all the time.

1469
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:56,791
This was when people used
their data packs with caution.

1470
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,671
So, I think, 'She's turned off
her data pack...

1471
01:16:59,863 --> 01:17:01,988
She must be in office,
I'll message her on Facebook.'

1472
01:17:02,599 --> 01:17:05,162
I tried that but it showed
her profile is deactivated!

1473
01:17:05,242 --> 01:17:06,522
I thought, 'Just a minute.

1474
01:17:06,602 --> 01:17:08,604
No matter what goes on in a relationship,
Facebook is like office!

1475
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:11,457
Every HR department
keeps an eye on Facebook...

1476
01:17:11,537 --> 01:17:13,519
This is not the way to behave, right?'

1477
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:16,393
I thought, 'This is wrong,
don't do this...'

1478
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:18,545
I was thinking about it, I thought,

1479
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:21,027
'The profile isn't there...
It's just showing 'Facebook User'.

1480
01:17:21,482 --> 01:17:23,787
I was thinking,
'How crazy is this girl.'

1481
01:17:24,702 --> 01:17:25,946
That's when the guy inside you,

1482
01:17:26,026 --> 01:17:27,876
the one who tells you the truth,
he says, 'Listen...'

1483
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:28,756
I said, 'Yeah?'

1484
01:17:29,493 --> 01:17:30,642
'You've been blocked.'

1485
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:44,201
I realised, 'Oh, oh, oh, oh! Yes!'

1486
01:17:45,518 --> 01:17:46,793
Then, the second step...

1487
01:17:46,873 --> 01:17:47,919
In the different stages of
emotions that you're going through!

1488
01:17:47,999 --> 01:17:50,763
The second step is, you think,
well every guy has this delusion,

1489
01:17:51,038 --> 01:17:53,762
'My life would be an endless
parade of parties and sex...

1490
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:57,723
But, it had stopped
because of this relationship.

1491
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:58,767
It stopped!

1492
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:01,807
So, you step outside
like you own the world!

1493
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:04,996
Like, 'Yeah, come on,
where are all those other girls?'

1494
01:18:06,613 --> 01:18:08,461
Yes, proclaim it in the whole city!

1495
01:18:09,135 --> 01:18:10,998
"Attention! Attention! Attention!"

1496
01:18:14,666 --> 01:18:17,719
Yeah, just make them stand in a queue,
long haired girls ahead...

1497
01:18:18,602 --> 01:18:20,660
Yeah, in a line, make them stand
in descending order...

1498
01:18:21,109 --> 01:18:21,993
Not height, length of hair!

1499
01:18:22,269 --> 01:18:23,401
If she's hot, then even a bob cut is fine.

1500
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:24,522
Just put her to the front, then...

1501
01:18:24,813 --> 01:18:26,534
We are very lenient that way!

1502
01:18:27,927 --> 01:18:31,205
When you actually step out, it's
deathly silent, it's a barren world...

1503
01:18:32,186 --> 01:18:34,094
So, barren that there are
bats flying by!

1504
01:18:35,515 --> 01:18:37,903
For the first time,
the sex-ratio of India hits you!

1505
01:18:38,510 --> 01:18:39,662
And you remember what you said earlier...

1506
01:18:39,742 --> 01:18:41,900
'She won't find anyone', but
that line is actually about you!

1507
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:49,226
Then you feel like, 'Please! Like,
please! I'm not crying over a girl!'

1508
01:18:50,215 --> 01:18:52,183
Now, chauvinism runs in your blood!

1509
01:18:53,598 --> 01:18:54,720
Patriarchy!

1510
01:18:56,831 --> 01:18:58,118
Your brother is here,
he won't go without explaining!

1511
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:01,096
Thinking no end to yourself!

1512
01:19:02,256 --> 01:19:04,464
But the thing is, even though
these things are in your blood...

1513
01:19:05,376 --> 01:19:06,668
Love doesn't know misogyny

1514
01:19:07,029 --> 01:19:08,444
and memories don't know chauvinism!

1515
01:19:09,275 --> 01:19:10,308
You're fucked!

1516
01:19:14,454 --> 01:19:17,133
So, I thought! Of course I'll
go to a restaurant to eat.

1517
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,338
I mean, come on!

1518
01:19:18,727 --> 01:19:21,166
Just because I've broken up,
I won't go to a restaurant? Please!

1519
01:19:23,449 --> 01:19:25,395
I reached and the
waiter came to me, "Sir,

1520
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:29,474
Table for two, sir?"

1521
01:19:30,276 --> 01:19:31,022
I said, "Come here,

1522
01:19:32,659 --> 01:19:33,465
come stand here.

1523
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,889
Look in my direction...

1524
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:41,300
For about 6 kilometres, there isn't
one fucking goat, let alone a girl!

1525
01:19:45,851 --> 01:19:47,819
How in the hell can you
ask if I want a table for two?"

1526
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:50,686
He said, "No, Sir, actually you used to
come with that ma'am... That's why..."

1527
01:19:50,865 --> 01:19:52,070
I said, "Yeah yeah... I didn't today."

1528
01:19:52,257 --> 01:19:53,873
He said, "No no...
She had come yesterday..."

1529
01:19:57,495 --> 01:20:00,361
I said, "Yeah, she must've come
with her friends..."

1530
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:02,465
He says, "No...

1531
01:20:04,275 --> 01:20:05,631
She wasn't here with her friends.

1532
01:20:06,457 --> 01:20:07,254
She was here with a guy!"

1533
01:20:07,334 --> 01:20:08,047
I said, "Aaaah!

1534
01:20:10,397 --> 01:20:11,078
Understood..."

1535
01:20:11,317 --> 01:20:12,365
I said, "Yeah, must be some friend..."

1536
01:20:13,173 --> 01:20:15,336
He said, "He wasn't a friend.
They made out."

1537
01:20:17,903 --> 01:20:19,175
"Okay... okay..."

1538
01:20:19,429 --> 01:20:21,165
I said, "No problem, no problem..."

1539
01:20:21,606 --> 01:20:22,462
"What do you mean, no problem?

1540
01:20:22,542 --> 01:20:26,380
Sir, they were sitting at the corner table!

1541
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:28,738
They were kissing,
sir, they were kissing!"

1542
01:20:28,818 --> 01:20:30,277
I said, "Oh, dude... nothing..."

1543
01:20:30,357 --> 01:20:34,687
I said, "No, nothing...
Nothing... Nothing... Nothing!"

1544
01:20:34,767 --> 01:20:36,895
I said, "I don't want to eat,
I'm leaving!"

1545
01:20:37,037 --> 01:20:40,353
He said, "Sir, where are you going, sir?
Sir, they might get married sir!"

1546
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:45,261
I said, "No... no, no, I heard.
Aah!

1547
01:20:46,668 --> 01:20:47,529
I heard you!"

1548
01:20:52,886 --> 01:20:55,498
For the first time,
I thought, "Okay...

1549
01:20:56,321 --> 01:20:57,429
Something major has happened in life!"

1550
01:20:58,858 --> 01:21:00,191
But, when you're breaking up
or falling in love,

1551
01:21:00,271 --> 01:21:01,425
one fucked up thing happens,

1552
01:21:01,972 --> 01:21:04,195
you start understanding
lyrics of songs..."

1553
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:10,961
And songs that are just mediocre,
that are flops...

1554
01:21:11,111 --> 01:21:12,039
You start making people
listen to them saying,

1555
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:14,350
"Listen to the 5th line in the 4th
stanza is awesome.

1556
01:21:14,538 --> 01:21:15,789
Listen to it, please!"

1557
01:21:16,006 --> 01:21:17,989
And that line would be the most cliched
line but you'd be like, "Right?

1558
01:21:18,069 --> 01:21:20,197
It's the story of my life, right?
The story of my life..."

1559
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:22,794
And people are like, "Shut this
down, what is all this drama?!"

1560
01:21:24,694 --> 01:21:26,782
Dude, three months passed by,
I didn't talk to anyone.

1561
01:21:27,606 --> 01:21:29,799
I'd be taking a bath for two hours!
Just didn't care about time!

1562
01:21:29,879 --> 01:21:32,014
Yeah, I mean, what do you do
for so long alone?

1563
01:21:32,291 --> 01:21:33,496
I wasn't talking to anyone.

1564
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:35,361
On Saturday...

1565
01:21:36,533 --> 01:21:37,783
At about 11:30 pm...

1566
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:39,834
And four pegs of Chivas Regal down...

1567
01:21:41,728 --> 01:21:46,054
I realised, 'Dude, I'm just destroying
my life. I should talk to my friends!'

1568
01:21:47,529 --> 01:21:49,909
So, I called my
childhood friend, Kuntal.

1569
01:21:52,188 --> 01:21:53,759
Kuntal's background...

1570
01:21:54,006 --> 01:21:55,810
Kuntal is also known as Radhesham.

1571
01:21:58,092 --> 01:21:58,915
And uh...

1572
01:22:00,038 --> 01:22:01,737
Radhesham was his father's name.

1573
01:22:05,598 --> 01:22:06,893
It's just juvenile assholery...

1574
01:22:09,423 --> 01:22:13,068
So, you'd either be known by
your surname or by your father's name!

1575
01:22:16,024 --> 01:22:18,366
After eleventh grade,
we never went to Kuntal's place,

1576
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:21,146
because... Once, we didn't know that uncle
wasn't feeling well

1577
01:22:22,663 --> 01:22:23,777
and he was at home.

1578
01:22:24,757 --> 01:22:27,339
We came over, and yelled, "Radhesham!
Come out!"

1579
01:22:33,775 --> 01:22:35,107
Radhesham came out...

1580
01:22:36,776 --> 01:22:37,368
Sorry...

1581
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,785
Radhesham Uncle came out.

1582
01:22:42,202 --> 01:22:43,863
That day, uncle found out two things.

1583
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:46,303
One, that we call Kuntal
by his father's name.

1584
01:22:46,886 --> 01:22:49,618
And two that his asshole
son actually responds to Radhesham!

1585
01:22:57,762 --> 01:22:58,525
What, then?

1586
01:22:59,468 --> 01:23:00,703
I called Kuntal...

1587
01:23:00,897 --> 01:23:03,674
1 ring, 2 rings, 3 rings... Dude,
it's been 10 years since we'd talked.

1588
01:23:03,996 --> 01:23:05,844
I had to talk to someone!

1589
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,441
4th ring, 5th ring, 6th ring,

1590
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:10,350
7th is when the son-of-a-bitch
finally picked up!

1591
01:23:11,166 --> 01:23:14,641
What did he know about my life.
Even I didn't know anything about his!

1592
01:23:14,721 --> 01:23:16,252
He was from the boy's school!

1593
01:23:17,392 --> 01:23:19,720
I said, "Hello?"
He says, (whispers) "Helloo?"

1594
01:23:21,276 --> 01:23:23,911
I said, "Kuntal?"
He says, "I'm in a movie."

1595
01:23:25,789 --> 01:23:27,548
I said, "Okay. Can you talk for 2 minutes?"

1596
01:23:27,705 --> 01:23:29,082
"With a girl!"

1597
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:34,141
I asked, "You're on a date?"

1598
01:23:34,284 --> 01:23:35,945
He says, "No, no! I'm in a group, in a group!"

1599
01:23:37,906 --> 01:23:39,178
I asked, "How many guys?"

1600
01:23:40,144 --> 01:23:40,982
He says, "Six."

1601
01:23:42,404 --> 01:23:44,972
I asked, "How many girls?"
He said, "One."

1602
01:23:51,948 --> 01:23:53,482
I asked, "Can we talk for 2 minutes?"

1603
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:54,612
He says, "Yeah, tell me!"

1604
01:23:55,271 --> 01:23:56,289
So, I told him my whole thing,

1605
01:23:56,369 --> 01:23:58,542
"Man, Kuntal, I can't stand it
any more, I can't understand what to do,

1606
01:23:58,622 --> 01:23:59,365
I can't understand
what is right or wrong,

1607
01:23:59,445 --> 01:24:00,009
I've had a bad breakup ya..."

1608
01:24:00,152 --> 01:24:03,048
I told him everything and
he heard me out nicely, attentively

1609
01:24:03,325 --> 01:24:05,548
and he said exactly
what I needed to hear.

1610
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:07,868
As in, he gave me the right advice.

1611
01:24:08,015 --> 01:24:09,139
He heard me out and said,

1612
01:24:09,814 --> 01:24:11,376
"Why are you crying like a bitch,
dickhead!"

1613
01:24:22,611 --> 01:24:26,510
I said, "Oh! This was quite
an emotionally mature response!"

1614
01:24:29,002 --> 01:24:33,066
But that's the day I realised, that,
I had just become so... Alone!

1615
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:35,797
But you know, there's a chance in life,

1616
01:24:35,877 --> 01:24:38,192
when you realise that no one else
is going to help you, you are alone.

1617
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,240
Just frighteningly alone...

1618
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,164
That's when I began working.

1619
01:24:42,301 --> 01:24:45,242
And there are two ways, either
you drink yourself to becoming Devdas

1620
01:24:45,422 --> 01:24:47,390
or work your ass off to become a legend.

1621
01:24:49,171 --> 01:24:50,324
I said, 'Just a minute...

1622
01:24:51,889 --> 01:24:53,415
I didn't come here to die!'

1623
01:24:54,575 --> 01:24:57,696
And, honestly, I credit the
work I did then for the fame I have now.

1624
01:24:57,776 --> 01:24:59,567
I wrote a poem during that
time, would you like to hear it?

1625
01:24:59,852 --> 01:25:01,259
(Audience) Yes!

1626
01:25:01,339 --> 01:25:04,963
Your treachery burnt me,
my soul, my spine.

1627
01:25:06,146 --> 01:25:09,469
Your treachery burnt me,
my soul, my spine.

1628
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:13,038
I wouldn't have turned into fire,
Had you truly been mine!

1629
01:25:21,224 --> 01:25:22,723
But, you know,

1630
01:25:22,803 --> 01:25:27,525
when they do leave you, you
go through so many different emotions...

1631
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,552
But when you leave someone,
you don't feel that bad...

1632
01:25:30,806 --> 01:25:32,483
You're just, like,
"Just, don't die, okay? Hehe.

1633
01:25:33,868 --> 01:25:36,944
Yeah, don't die.
Don't do this... Get a grip!"

1634
01:25:38,352 --> 01:25:40,275
But when someone leaves you,

1635
01:25:40,355 --> 01:25:43,186
it's like you drown in your deepest,
darkest insecurities,

1636
01:25:43,266 --> 01:25:44,294
which is not right!

1637
01:25:44,878 --> 01:25:48,052
When you ask yourself, 'Why me?
Why did this happen to me?'

1638
01:25:48,132 --> 01:25:50,491
And in the answer,
you tell yourself things

1639
01:25:50,571 --> 01:25:53,358
you'd hate for anyone else
to say to you.

1640
01:25:54,173 --> 01:25:57,047
You tell yourself that,
they left me because I'm dark.

1641
01:25:57,623 --> 01:25:59,801
You tell yourself that,
they left me because I'm fat.

1642
01:25:59,881 --> 01:26:01,844
You tell yourself that,
they left me because I'm short.

1643
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:03,984
You tell yourself that, they
left me because I'm from a poor home.

1644
01:26:04,216 --> 01:26:06,798
You tell yourself that, they
left me because I'm from a lower caste.

1645
01:26:08,048 --> 01:26:10,233
But I say, each relationship has an age.

1646
01:26:10,313 --> 01:26:13,212
And once it reaches that age,
the relation is over!

1647
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:16,909
And there's no right or wrong,
good or bad in this.

1648
01:26:17,082 --> 01:26:18,145
Nobody is a villain!

1649
01:26:18,225 --> 01:26:21,273
But... You. Are. The. Hero!

1650
01:26:27,889 --> 01:26:28,750
But, if these things were true,

1651
01:26:28,830 --> 01:26:30,703
there never would have been
a relationship in the first place!

1652
01:26:31,003 --> 01:26:33,121
Also, the most beautiful
thing about a breakup is that

1653
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:36,055
you become your most vulnerable self.

1654
01:26:36,961 --> 01:26:39,206
You get to see a new you,
you see a new Zakir!

1655
01:26:39,286 --> 01:26:40,381
A completely different human being!

1656
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:43,254
You say, 'Am I the one
doing this now? I'm doing this?!'

1657
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:46,241
Here I was, mentally quite,
it had been 8-9 months now.

1658
01:26:46,321 --> 01:26:48,336
I had mentally moved on quite
a lot by now. Things seemed better.

1659
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:49,833
Life seemed better.

1660
01:26:50,237 --> 01:26:52,378
That's when a friend called me,
his name was Anand.

1661
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:54,386
He said, 'Dude, I saw Shruti.

1662
01:26:55,363 --> 01:26:56,950
She was sitting in so-and-so restaurant."

1663
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:00,655
In my mind, I have moved on.

1664
01:27:00,735 --> 01:27:05,130
As in, I'm single but I'm
comfortable in my own space now!

1665
01:27:05,700 --> 01:27:08,102
But this was the first time,
I saw myself getting ready...

1666
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:11,170
In such a hurry. I've not done up my
buttons properly, I'm wearing my shoes!

1667
01:27:11,814 --> 01:27:12,862
I'm stopping a rickshaw.

1668
01:27:13,326 --> 01:27:14,680
I reach that restaurant.

1669
01:27:16,087 --> 01:27:18,849
I reach, I see her. She's sitting
in the restaurant with some guy.

1670
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:21,252
I don't know what to do.
I'm...

1671
01:27:21,332 --> 01:27:23,130
I'm seeing her for the
first time in 7-8 months!

1672
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:27,079
Everything that I had build
up in myself during that time,

1673
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,717
just crashed, collapsed...

1674
01:27:29,797 --> 01:27:30,511
Once again, I'm just
not understanding anything.

1675
01:27:30,591 --> 01:27:31,949
What do I say?
What do I say? What do I say?

1676
01:27:32,029 --> 01:27:33,572
I'm in the middle
of an emotional outburst.

1677
01:27:33,744 --> 01:27:34,747
And I know it's too late.

1678
01:27:34,827 --> 01:27:36,558
I know I can't say anything
that would make her come back.

1679
01:27:36,638 --> 01:27:38,856
And yet, I'm still thinking, 'What
do I say that'll make her come back to me?'

1680
01:27:38,936 --> 01:27:40,352
I'm thinking,
'Should I fall at her feet?'

1681
01:27:40,651 --> 01:27:42,283
Like, 'If I do fall at her feet,
will she take me back?'

1682
01:27:42,363 --> 01:27:43,922
What do I tell her?
What should I say? What should I say?

1683
01:27:44,078 --> 01:27:44,879
So, I...

1684
01:27:46,114 --> 01:27:50,896
I just said,
"Everything about my future,

1685
01:27:51,308 --> 01:27:53,553
I have always imagined it with you.

1686
01:27:53,777 --> 01:27:58,080
When you're not there,
I cannot imagine my future!"

1687
01:28:02,467 --> 01:28:05,333
And just as I said it, I felt
like, all of this has happened!

1688
01:28:08,042 --> 01:28:12,003
And then I realised, 'No no no
no no no no no no...

1689
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:13,206
I'm not that guy.'

1690
01:28:14,396 --> 01:28:15,750
You know, I began
talking to myself saying,

1691
01:28:15,830 --> 01:28:19,088
'This is a low point of my life but I'm
not going to let it become the lowest!'

1692
01:28:21,003 --> 01:28:22,732
When I loved, I loved with pride.

1693
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:25,658
If I must be single,
I'll be single with pride!

1694
01:28:34,691 --> 01:28:36,300
She said, "Whaa- tell me
what do you want to talk about?"

1695
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,268
I said, "No no no I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

1696
01:28:38,889 --> 01:28:42,129
"I'm sorry that I came here.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

1697
01:28:42,209 --> 01:28:43,992
She said, "No, tell me, tell me, tell
me, what you wanted to say, tell me?"

1698
01:28:44,072 --> 01:28:46,926
I said, "No, it was my mistake
that I came here.

1699
01:28:47,173 --> 01:28:48,827
And you will never
see this face in your life.

1700
01:28:49,523 --> 01:28:50,746
Except maybe on TV, but..."

1701
01:28:52,048 --> 01:28:52,804
Please!

1702
01:28:56,782 --> 01:28:58,908
It's okay to be cocky
in such dire straits!

1703
01:29:00,622 --> 01:29:03,885
And this nut sitting there,
is judging me like a motherfucker!

1704
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:08,799
I told her, "No, no no.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

1705
01:29:10,835 --> 01:29:12,112
I told him, I said, "Listen...

1706
01:29:13,824 --> 01:29:15,236
There will be one cardamom
in your biryani!"

1707
01:29:20,258 --> 01:29:21,763
But I still hadn't gotten closure!

1708
01:29:22,167 --> 01:29:24,217
I thought, 'I need to say
something to her, something...

1709
01:29:24,297 --> 01:29:25,183
I want to say something!'

1710
01:29:25,263 --> 01:29:26,328
And I'm not getting exactly what
to say...

1711
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:27,181
What do I say?

1712
01:29:27,261 --> 01:29:29,076
So, I'm thinking, 'I have
to say something to her, something!'

1713
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:30,880
But still 'What do I say to her?'

1714
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:31,756
So I said,

1715
01:29:32,879 --> 01:29:36,688
"He must've just said yes
to everything you must've said...

1716
01:29:37,743 --> 01:29:40,506
And I just want to tell
you... That...

1717
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,965
Sachin beats everyone!"

1718
01:29:47,441 --> 01:29:49,132
That's it for my set,
Thank you very much!

1719
01:29:50,033 --> 01:29:51,221
You've been a great audience!

1720
01:30:21,366 --> 01:30:23,012
But I know...
To be very honest and frank,

1721
01:30:23,401 --> 01:30:26,193
this is above and beyond my standing.

1722
01:30:26,694 --> 01:30:28,281
But thank you very much guys.

1723
01:30:28,648 --> 01:30:30,107
You have made it special.

1724
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:34,021
Thank you very much.
Goodnight. Take care.
