1
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,323
Hello. I should use a microphone, really.

2
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:24,457
Hi.

3
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:26,058
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:27,561
Thank you.

5
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,799
Thank you.

6
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,703
Thank you.
That was the perfect amount of applause.

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,239
I didn't have to stand here
too awkwardly long.

8
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:41,174
Thank you for coming. I am Jen.

9
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:45,212
If you didn't know, maybe you wandered in,
now you're having a fun time with me.

10
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:46,647
Um...

11
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:50,717
It has been brought to my attention
by doctors,

12
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,087
some codependent yoga teachers,
and everyone who's ever met me

13
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,455
that I am high strung.

14
00:00:56,089 --> 00:01:01,528
And... it's been suggested...
that therapy isn't enough,

15
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,497
that I need to meditate.

16
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,168
And so, now,
I am one of these people who meditates.

17
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,739
And by "I meditate,"
I mean, "I do not ever meditate."

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,808
But...

19
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,347
I have a meditation playlist,
some gongs going, "gong, gong."

20
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,283
I've got apps, I think about meditation.

21
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,585
I have a meditation chair
in my living room.

22
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:28,522
You have one, too.
It's just a fucking chair.

23
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,723
But...

24
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:34,294
I put a candle next to it
and I call it my meditation chair, yeah.

25
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,397
And when you come over,
I point out to you,

26
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:41,768
"Oh, don't mind that, that just, um...
That's my meditation chair, yeah.

27
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:45,505
No, every morning I get up
and I think about doing it and I don't.

28
00:01:45,639 --> 00:01:49,242
I get up and I... sit in it
and take a few deep breaths.

29
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,546
Don't be intimidated, you can sit in it
if you want. Yeah, it's not...

30
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
Not everyone's
on the same spiritual plane,

31
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,617
but we don't have any rules

32
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,286
in this... happy home
with the chair and the...

33
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,822
Don't worry about why the candle
has never been lit, just..."

34
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,162
But this one day, I did meditate
because I had an important thing to do.

35
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,230
I wanted to get a job.

36
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,799
I wanted to write
and I wanted someone to pay me for it.

37
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,335
I wanted to have an interview
and I wanted to get it.

38
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:18,305
So, that being said,
there were a little nerves in the morning.

39
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,841
I thought
maybe I'll try this meditation thing

40
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,476
that everyone is talking about.

41
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,611
And I did about five minutes
of meditation.

42
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:28,181
And if you're not impressed with that,
then you've never meditated.

43
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:34,554
Because after five seconds, you're like,
"Why did the Lord stop time?"

44
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,629
Five minutes is a long time
to clear your mind of things and I did it.

45
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,499
And I woke up and came out of it
and I was like:

46
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,736
"Oh, I get what everyone's talking about.
I feel... so...

47
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,338
Like, I could handle anything.

48
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:56,777
If I didn't have to leave the house today,
I could really handle anything."

49
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,847
But I did have to leave the house.
And so, I got in my car

50
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,950
and I'm driving
in the Los Angeles 9 a.m. traffic.

51
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,753
When I saw the green light,
I was like, "Green's pretty."

52
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,856
And I was trying to figure out
what green meant, like, on a deeper level.

53
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,326
And I'm like,
"Green, what can that tell me?"

54
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,928
And I didn't realize in that moment,

55
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,664
all I needed to know about green
is it means fucking go.

56
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:20,300
And so, I'm, "Green,"
and I start to slow down.

57
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,903
And the people behind me
are starting to lose it

58
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,738
because they are late for work.

59
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,841
And so they're just, "beep!"
and they're honking and their horns,

60
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:31,678
and I'm like, "Oh, now it's yellow.
Oh, red. Oh, that was fun."

61
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:35,682
And I realized... I'm stopped
at the red light, which is normal,

62
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,453
but I really stopped at the green light.
And then I realized, "Oh, my God, I...

63
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,289
I screwed these people."
That could've made the difference

64
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,459
between them being early and being late.
Guy behind is pissed like:

65
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,863
I see him in my rear-view mirror.
And I just... I feel so calm, though,

66
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,832
because I meditated. Yeah, so...

67
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:57,604
I just turned and give him a wave
that just says like, "I'm so sorry.

68
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm sorry you think
you're late for work, but...

69
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,445
you don't know what I know.

70
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,783
There is no time, so, yeah."

71
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,686
I'm even embarrassed to say
that I heard his horn.

72
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,488
That's not very meditation of me.

73
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,823
What is a sound, right? That's...

74
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:20,560
That's just the meaning
I placed on it, right?

75
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,764
I could've heard anything.
I could've heard butterflies eating candy.

76
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,434
So... I'm driving,
feeling really good about myself,

77
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:30,704
and just, like... Just so much better
than everyone else that's so mad.

78
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,974
And that's what meditation's for,
is to feel superior to others.

79
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,642
So...

80
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,646
I turned the corner
and we go to the next stoplight...

81
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:43,517
and I pull up to it and so does the guy
behind me that was all pissed.

82
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,053
And I've got the sunroof open,
the windows down.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,588
I'm just happy as can be.

84
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,991
Again, did I mention
I had meditated that morning?

85
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:52,793
And the guy next to me,

86
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,595
typical what you think of Los Angeles
if you've never been.

87
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:58,932
Producer-looking guy,
kind of chomping on his cigar,

88
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:03,537
bald, kind of chubby, in his red BMW,
probably 50, two divorces.

89
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,339
And he's sitting there
and he is pissed at me.

90
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,042
And he's in his car...
and he just looks over and goes,

91
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,479
"Hey, dumbass,
what were you doing at that light?"

92
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,682
And I'm just sitting in my car like:

93
00:05:21,388 --> 00:05:22,556
"I meditated today.

94
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,024
Can't get angry.

95
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,730
What would it be like to kill him?
Don't think about that."

96
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,836
So, he yells again, "Hey, dumbass,
what were you doing at that light?

97
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,038
Texting your boyfriend?"

98
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,539
That one got me.

99
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,844
Because I didn't have a boyfriend
and I was not happy about it.

100
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,082
Then I got pissed. I'm like,
"He thinks I'm texting my boyfriend?

101
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,018
That's what he thinks
when a woman makes a mistake in traffic?

102
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:54,821
It's always about a man.
Anytime you see a five-car pile up,

103
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,091
it's like, 'Are you coming home for dinner
or not?'" You know?

104
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,563
So, I was like,
"This guy is not gonna bully me.

105
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,566
Fuck this. I don't care about meditation.
Everybody gets angry.

106
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:07,767
I'm not a goddamn saint."

107
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,903
Not that they meditate,
but whatever they do.

108
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,073
And so, I put the car in park
and I stood up in my seat

109
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,776
and I put my head out of the sunroof
and then I went into the passenger seat.

110
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,815
And I leaned over and I went,
"What the fuck did you just say to me?"

111
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,959
For those at home watching,
this isn't being taped in New York City.

112
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,798
He said, "I said, what were you doing
at that light, dumbass?"

113
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,533
Now, I didn't wanna tell him,

114
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:43,603
"I meditated today
and I got loopy at the green light."

115
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,107
I didn't want to tell him that because he
was mean to me and I wanted to win.

116
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,611
I wanted to say something
that would make him feel so bad

117
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,848
about what he did that he'd be like,
"Oh, my God, I have to think

118
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,617
before I speak
and put myself in other people's shoes.

119
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,453
You never know
what someone's going through." Right?

120
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:04,824
So, I said to him something that's true,
meaning, I actually said it.

121
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,459
The content is not true.

122
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:11,698
I said, "What was I doing? I was thinking.

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:14,768
I just found out that my mother died
this morning."

124
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:18,705
I didn't say I was a good person,
I just said I meditated.

125
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,176
He goes, "You're still a dumbass."
And I was like:

126
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:28,081
"What kind of person says that to someone
whose mother just died?"

127
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,583
She didn't, he doesn't know.
He is a bad person.

128
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,953
I am the winner in this story still.

129
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:36,523
And then I just lost it.

130
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,759
And I went, "Oh, go fuck your car."

131
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,497
I don't know what that means either,
but I just...

132
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,901
I had to keep going,
like I knew what I was talking about.

133
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,470
Like, "Yeah, stick your dick
in the tailpipe, buddy.

134
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,040
I know who you are.
What are you, a producer?

135
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,644
Divorced? You had two wives
and left both of them for your assistant.

136
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,947
And what, you...? You tell young girls
you're gonna put them in movies?

137
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:03,817
You don't have any movies to put them in.
You're a loser."

138
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,619
And the light turned green and he...

139
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,688
The light turned green and he drove off.

140
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:11,491
That's what you do at green lights,
you drive away.

141
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,530
So, as he drives off, he screams,
"You're crazy." And I was like:

142
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:23,636
And I screamed out of the...
Out of the passenger seat sunroof:

143
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:28,808
"I'm not crazy.
I meditated today, motherfucker."

144
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:32,711
Thank you.

145
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,815
Which is an ancient chant from the Buddha.

146
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:39,652
So... But then I thought...
My adrenaline's going, I'm shaking.

147
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,956
And I went, "Holy shit, all this happened
and I meditated today.

148
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,858
What if I hadn't, you know?"

149
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,631
And just a little lesson for you guys,
do not call a woman crazy

150
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,869
unless you wanna see a woman
go fucking crazy, okay? Just don't.

151
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,272
Save yourselves. If you wanna see...
If you wanna tell a woman she's crazy,

152
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,240
just call her calm.

153
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,543
It'll just throw us off
and the whole thing's dissipated. Just go,

154
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,578
"Hey, you're being really calm right now."

155
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:09,315
"Oh, thank you. A psychic told me
I was calm once. Thanks.

156
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,986
What were we fighting about?
I didn't even know."

157
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,322
So... I'm driving and I'm like:

158
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,792
"Okay, just calm down.
Adrenaline's coming down."

159
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,228
I get to the next stoplight.
This stoplight never changes.

160
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,965
The guy is there again and I'm like,
"Okay, don't start anything, Jen.

161
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:30,170
Stay in your lane
and, literally, do not be or seem crazy."

162
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:34,207
So, I put on some music
and I'm bopping around happy as can be.

163
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:36,042
"Look at me, I'm not crazy at all.

164
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,578
I wasn't just screaming,
'I meditated, motherfucker.'

165
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:39,846
I am fun and happy."

166
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,583
And he's kind of looking at me
and he yells into my car,

167
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,152
"Hey... sorry about your mom."

168
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,122
And I'm like,
"Oh, fuck, I forgot my mom died."

169
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,189
And so, you know...

170
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,332
I suddenly get real upset, I go:

171
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:04,904
"Oh, I know, it's been a tough morning.
So much paperwork."

172
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,639
What? I don't know... What is...?

173
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,243
Why would there be paperwork so soon,
an hour?

174
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,947
If it's real,
she lives in Boston, I live in L.A.,

175
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:17,016
she died an hour ago, there's paperwork,
do I have a fax machine

176
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,252
that's like, "Someone died, come on,"
you know?

177
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,889
And so, he looks at me and goes,

178
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,226
"Well, love, we got kind of heated,
but I hope you have a good day

179
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,895
whatever you're doing."
And I'm like, "You, too, man."

180
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,998
And he drives off and I start sobbing.
I'm like, "Oh, my God.

181
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,002
So full of emotion, you know. I don't know
if it's just my mom or just... I...

182
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,308
It just kind of... You know, I've talked
to two people this morning already

183
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,978
and I would never do that,
but that's the meditation,

184
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,379
it brings us together.

185
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,648
It's so powerful."

186
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,016
So, then I parked the car.

187
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,252
I'm no longer crying, or passionate,
or crazy,

188
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,187
or condescending because I'm meditating.

189
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,724
And I walk in into this meeting,
introduce myself, we have a chitchat,

190
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,894
they're gonna pay me,
I'm gonna do the job, I nailed it.

191
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,996
I'm like,
"I shouldn't be allowed to do that.

192
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:06,733
I should not be allowed to act normal
'cause I was acting like a maniac."

193
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:09,702
How come they don't have to know
what I was doing.

194
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,272
You're allowed into a building
and be whatever you want

195
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,742
even though you were screaming.
I can't believe we do that, but we do.

196
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,678
I'm like, "But registered sex offenders
don't get to do that."

197
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:21,147
I feel like, I should...
When I get crazy like that,

198
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,683
I should be treated
like a registered sex offender.

199
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,186
Like, they have to go door-to-door.
"I'm your neighbor.

200
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:30,156
I have things in my past."
Like, I should have to go to a meeting,

201
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:33,860
like, "Hello, I'm a nice person,
but I just screamed, 'I meditated today, '

202
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,963
in the middle of the road and..."
But I got away with it.

203
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,766
It's like...
If you've ever been going to a party

204
00:11:39,832 --> 00:11:43,436
and you're in the car with your partner
and just... You hate them and you're like:

205
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,171
"That outfit doesn't match.

206
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,808
What's so funny is you talk
about how much you love your mom

207
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,477
and she used to put you in these outfits.
She fucking sucked

208
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:53,112
at teaching you how to dress.

209
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,883
Oh, yeah, I am gonna start in on your mom.
Oh, yeah, I am. Oh, yes, I am.

210
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,718
Oh, no. No, don't even... No, no, no.

211
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,120
Know what?
I wanna go to this party for five minutes

212
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:04,123
and I don't wanna look at you.
They're my friends, not yours."

213
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,060
Then you walk in, "Hey,
I brought muffins," and you're like...

214
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,332
You wanna stay all night.
"Aren't we having fun?"

215
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,467
He's in the corner
and your friends are like:

216
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,203
"Isn't she great?"
And he's like, "She's fucking great."

217
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:22,342
And you get back in the car
and you forget about the fight from before

218
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,311
and you're like,
"Weren't those muffins great? I'm great."

219
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:29,315
And he's just looking at you like,
"Shut up. I know who you really are."

220
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:38,257
I know you can probably sense
I'm a bit of a badass. Um...

221
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:43,096
Not... I don't mean because of that story,
but you can tell I have a tattoo.

222
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,162
I know you can.

223
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,365
Um...

224
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,367
I have... Not everyone gets one, you know.

225
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,436
There's badasses
and the rest of you and, um...

226
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:54,073
But I have a tattoo
and I'm only gonna have one.

227
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,509
I think the whole tattoo thing
is a lot like kids.

228
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,511
Like, first of all, some people want one,

229
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,914
some people want none,
some people want a bunch, like...

230
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,051
And it's all over their arms
and it looks like a lot of work. But...

231
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,422
But you go to a place, you lay down,
there's a lot of pain and you're like:

232
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,524
"God, I hope I love it. It is permanent."

233
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,791
So...

234
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:19,032
So, I'm having a tattoo
instead of a child.

235
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,168
And... So, for me,
I'm one of the one-and-doner types.

236
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:26,039
So, you know that my tattoo
has to be very meaningful, right? If...

237
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,809
If you've ever thought about getting
a tattoo, you think about it for a while.

238
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:33,479
"I don't wanna get something dumb. I have
to have something that means something."

239
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:37,216
And I've been waiting my whole life
to find something succinct

240
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,053
that means something
that I can put on my body permanently.

241
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,922
I thought of something
a couple of years ago and I was like:

242
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,524
"Don't do it, give it another year

243
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,593
and if you're still thinking about it,
do it." That's what I did.

244
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,562
And I was inspired by my friend

245
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:53,299
who got a tattoo of her grandfather's name
on her wrist and his birthday

246
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,201
because he has an amazing story, so...

247
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:58,571
My... My friend's grandfather
survived the Holocaust

248
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,839
because he was a Nazi.

249
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:01,273
But...

250
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,475
No, that's... Okay.

251
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,444
Sorry.

252
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:06,912
That...

253
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,253
That's just a fun joke. That is not...

254
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:20,860
I didn't set you guys up,
there really is a story about my friend.

255
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:23,596
I just had to throw in because he was...

256
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,998
My friend's grandfather
survived the Holocaust.

257
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:29,302
And my friend, just like her father
and her father's father,

258
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:33,005
and like many of us in this country,
suffers from depression and anxiety.

259
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:37,310
And the story he would tell
was the survival story of his mind.

260
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:42,281
When he was in the camps,
he would say a prayer of gratitude to God

261
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:45,184
and say, "I don't...
If this has to end this way, fine,

262
00:14:45,585 --> 00:14:49,155
but thank you for making me me
and not one of the evil people.

263
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,959
Thank you for putting love in my heart."
And that is mind-blowing.

264
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:55,495
Of course you put that guy's name
on your wrist.

265
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,296
The most beautiful story I've heard.

266
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,532
And I don't have anyone in my family
like that.

267
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,566
I...

268
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,107
I come from a family of Catholic people
from Boston

269
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:10,610
and we don't talk to God like that.

270
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:15,615
We don't like God. We are mad at God
and we assume he's mad at us.

271
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:19,652
"Jennifer, why would you have gratitude
for a bad thing that happened?

272
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,155
That means God's mad... Mad at you.

273
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,221
He's punishing you.

274
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,960
Jennifer, why would you have gratitude
for God being so mean to you?

275
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:31,697
Maybe he'll think you like it there
and he'll keep you in there.

276
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,535
We're not bothering God
with all this gratitude

277
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,170
unless something good happens.

278
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,173
Nothing bad's ever happened in our family,
but it could

279
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,342
and we're gonna complain in advance
and we're gonna stay vigilant.

280
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,146
So, no tattoos
of anything our family said, please."

281
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,083
So, I had to go elsewhere.

282
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:54,720
So, I'll show you my... My tattoo...
and then I'll explain.

283
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,489
Thank you.

284
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,492
It's on my ankle. It's on my ankle.

285
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:08,067
It says, "JKL,"
which stands for JK living,

286
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,102
which stands for just keep living,

287
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,638
which is Matthew McConaughey's
catchphrase.

288
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,175
Thank you.

289
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,715
This tattoo
could not be less ironic at all.

290
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,718
I mean it with all my heart.

291
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,022
Just keep living... inspires me.

292
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,291
And I'm not suicidal.

293
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:38,164
But I am a soul trapped in a body.
I didn't ask to be born

294
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,300
and I'm afraid to die.
And that's the shit I live in every day.

295
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:43,503
And so...

296
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,338
Yeah.

297
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,410
I love what you get excited about.
"Yeah, that's right. We're trapped!"

298
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,518
Before you judge, or if you think I'm just
some shallow Hollywood person. No, no, no.

299
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,586
There's a story behind "just keep living."

300
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,624
Just like my friend had a story
behind her tattoo of her grandfather.

301
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,794
So, I'm at the nail salon
and I'm having a bad day...

302
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:13,266
but I don't know why I'm having a bad day.
I just don't feel good.

303
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,301
Physically, I feel fine.

304
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:17,036
Mentally, not into it.

305
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,473
So, I'm scrolling through
<i>People</i> magazine

306
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,242
and I see an article
about Matthew McConaughey.

307
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,579
Well, he had a tough day once, too.

308
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,386
I'm not sure why you're laughing.
This is very serious.

309
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,191
He was filming <i>Dazed and Confused</i>
and he knew he was going to be a big star,

310
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,427
but his father is dying, so, he was like:

311
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:45,298
"Something good and something bad
is happening at the same time.

312
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,368
Well, I guess I better just keep living."

313
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,605
And then that became his catchphrase.

314
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:55,575
And I see
you're not as moved to silence by it

315
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:57,543
as you were the Holocaust story.

316
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,212
And that's fine.
Different things for different people.

317
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,585
The thing about this tattoo
is it's in an inconvenient place.

318
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:08,554
If my friend is having a bad day,
she can remind herself,

319
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:11,457
"Not as bad as my grandfather had it,"
by going like this.

320
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,725
I have to be like:

321
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:18,197
"I will board this plane in a minute,
I'm having a bad day,

322
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,434
and I need a reminder...
Go... Go ahead. Go. Go ahead."

323
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,675
People say things about tattoos like,
"You're gonna regret it. It looks dumb."

324
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:32,812
I'm like, "It looks dumb now,
I'm all set. Thank you."

325
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,221
I got the, uh... I actually got the tattoo
on my birthday last year.

326
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:46,125
Didn't do anything fun for my birthday
this year. Got a gift from mom.

327
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,528
It wasn't my only gift,
but she handed me this piece of paper.

328
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:50,630
Um...

329
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,566
She does that now
that she's getting older.

330
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,702
I don't know if she's made a will,
but she seems to send me things

331
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,373
and hand me things whenever I see her
and it's always a dramatic speech.

332
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,409
"Jennifer, I had to give this to you

333
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,612
because if I die
how would you know I had it?"

334
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,218
I go, "I'm gonna ransack the house.
Yeah, I'll get everything, don't worry."

335
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,623
But she give me this thing
and it is as old as I am.

336
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,858
It is 42 years old.

337
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:22,428
It is the piece of paper they gave her
when she left the hospital with me

338
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,629
when I was a little baby.

339
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:27,366
I know, so cute. I was 7 and a half pounds
when I was born. So thin.

340
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,439
Now I am 42 years old
and I've been over this before,

341
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:37,410
you know, when we talk about
complimenting women and men, too,

342
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,879
of telling people they look young.
It's a scary thing.

343
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:43,282
Do not do this to people, okay?
Stop complimenting people by saying,

344
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,351
"You don't look your age." Don't do that.

345
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:47,486
I don't like
when women in their 20s are like:

346
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,290
"Oh, my God, I thought you were my age."
Not a compliment. I've been in my 20s.

347
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,326
I don't wanna look like
I have four roommates and shitty towels.

348
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,429
I don't wanna look like that. So...

349
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,730
Thank you.

350
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,969
I'm the only one I know that loves
being called "ma'am." I love it. I...

351
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:06,238
Whenever someone goes,
"Your change, ma'am,"

352
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,240
I'm like, "You noticed. Thank you. Yeah.

353
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,545
I have had a really rich and storied life.
Yeah. I, um...

354
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,847
No, I've got time to tell you.

355
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,818
I had a pager, sure, yeah. I...

356
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,855
I was a cashier before scan technology,
made change in my head.

357
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,959
And I was around when Bruce Willis
thought he should record an R&B album.

358
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,226
So, yeah.

359
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,930
Survivor, seen a lot. Thanks."

360
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,299
Anyways, my mom gives me this.

361
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,336
This is all they gave you in the '70s
when you had a child,

362
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,473
a living thing that you had
to take care of. Not even 8-by-10.

363
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:41,574
"Here you go. Bye."

364
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,310
This I found very strange.

365
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:49,515
It says, "Friends and relatives,
these people are interested in your baby."

366
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:51,783
Oh, thank you.

367
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,821
"And they want to hold and hug him."

368
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,290
Oh, they didn't have girls in the '70s.

369
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,363
"We must caution you
to keep visitors away from your baby.

370
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:08,033
The newborn baby is best kept
as much to himself as possible."

371
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,904
Which is different than now.
I go to my friends' houses, they're like:

372
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:15,608
"Look at the baby, swaddle the baby,
you can breastfeed the baby. It's fine."

373
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,713
But in the '70s, it's just like,
"Joyce, didn't you have a baby?"

374
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,914
"Yeah, three months ago."

375
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,316
"Where is he?" "He's in the other room.

376
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:26,018
We haven't taken him out yet.

377
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,920
You know, they say, the doctor says

378
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,689
too much looking, and touching,
and fussing, it...

379
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,527
It can lead to a sense of well-being,
so we don't want that, we're just gonna...

380
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,661
Don't look at him."

381
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:36,728
But...

382
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,534
This is my favorite part, we might have to
go over it twice if there's any confusion.

383
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,903
It explains crying. Why does a baby cry?

384
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,872
Well, he's too hot, he's too hungry,
he's too thirsty. We got it.

385
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:48,706
Here's one.

386
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,044
"If it is less than three hours
from the feeding,

387
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,715
check to make sure
there are no pins sticking in him.

388
00:21:58,918 --> 00:21:59,918
And change him."

389
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,723
So, I'll explain for anyone very young.

390
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:11,564
Velcro, although invented in the '40s,
was something they didn't put on diapers.

391
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,732
I don't know
if they didn't put it on diapers.

392
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,435
We didn't have Velcro diapers
in the '70s in my house.

393
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,905
Whenever we didn't have something,
we were told it wasn't invented yet.

394
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:23,709
I'd be like, "Can we get a microwave?"
My parents were like, "Not invented yet."

395
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:27,046
I'm like, "Oh, my God, I must be
so genius. How did I know there was...?"

396
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,518
But we... We did not have Velcro diapers.

397
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:36,689
Back then, you'd wear a cloth diaper and
then they'd put safety pins to keep it on.

398
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,592
So, that's fine.
Make sure no pins are sticking in him.

399
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:42,027
But why must you wait three hours?

400
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,495
Can't you...?

401
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,732
Can't you feed the baby,

402
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,402
put him down in the other room
where no friends or family can see him...

403
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,840
If five minutes goes by, can you check
and see if there's no pins in him?

404
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,387
If there aren't, then go,
"I guess he's gonna cry for a while."

405
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,478
But, no, this says three hours.

406
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,749
You could see a movie in three hours.
But you don't have a VCR back then.

407
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:07,019
So, you have to go to a movie
and you can come all the way back,

408
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:09,755
and have 15 minutes left
before you check on your kid.

409
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:13,726
"Should we check on him?" "It says three
hours. We don't wanna be smothering."

410
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:17,563
"You're right, we got 15. Make me a drink,
then we'll go in, I'm gonna..." So...

411
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,601
I basically know
that I was just thrown in another room

412
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,470
with pins sticking in me growing up.

413
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:29,008
Which is why I'm so comfortable
being alone and I do acupuncture.

414
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,508
But, um...

415
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,814
I travel alone,
I went to Italy by myself this year.

416
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:39,551
And it invoked a lot of reactions
from people.

417
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:43,022
You would have thought I said,
"I started a race riot this year."

418
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,824
People were like, "What? You did what?"

419
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:50,195
People are very freaked out
with being alone.

420
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,832
Like, I love being alone.
I think it's great.

421
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:55,634
People are like, "How do you do it?"

422
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:59,605
How do I decide that I don't like other
people and make sure I'm not around them?

423
00:23:59,672 --> 00:24:01,940
Pretty easy. People are like:

424
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,727
"I don't even wanna go
to the movies alone."

425
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,911
Why would you wanna go
with another person?

426
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:08,614
What can you do at the movies
with another person

427
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,516
besides jerk them off or something?

428
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,785
There's nothing to do at the movies.

429
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,219
And I'm a grown woman.

430
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:18,123
I don't care if people think
I'm a loser for being alone.

431
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,727
I was excited for this trip before people
started putting a damper on it.

432
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,896
My dad was saying,
"Aren't you afraid of ISIS?

433
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,864
ISIS is everywhere. Be afraid of ISIS."

434
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,902
I was like, "Who... I'm a woman.
I don't have time to be afraid of ISIS.

435
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:33,038
I'm just busy being afraid of
plain old men. Are you kidding me?"

436
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,077
You ever walked by a bar at 1 a.m. when
dudes in baseball hats are getting out?

437
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,179
Fuck ISIS. ISIS are adorable.

438
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,682
ISIS have costumes and beards,
look like bartenders.

439
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,051
ISIS, they're not...
I'm not afraid of them at all.

440
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,218
So...

441
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,824
I'm packing for my trip and I'm thinking
like, "Where should I go?"

442
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,928
Like, you know, I'm making list of, like,
where I'm gonna see and what I'm gonna do.

443
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,498
Then I Googled just at the last minute,
'cause I booked a trip to Venice.

444
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:00,565
I just Googled,

445
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,669
"What are the safest places in Italy
where woman don't get raped?"

446
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:06,205
- Oh!
- "Oh! Oh! She said rape."

447
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,273
Let me fucking tell you something.

448
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,340
Rape exists, I'm gonna talk about it.
That's not a joke, that's a fact.

449
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,779
I looked that up
because I didn't wanna get raped.

450
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,081
I'll stop talking about rape
when men stop raping.

451
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,817
So, don't give me your little outrage,
"Ooh, oh, oh!"

452
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,119
So...

453
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:25,824
But it's true, there are websites
for this stuff. Well, it's just Yelp.

454
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:30,028
There should be... There should be "Relp"
for like, "Where will I get raped? Help."

455
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,597
And so you go on that website.

456
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:34,233
So... I felt very safe in Venice,

457
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:37,770
and if anyone cares I came out of it
unscathed, it was a very safe time.

458
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,104
But people were saying to me:

459
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:42,007
"Wouldn't you rather wait
and go with a man?"

460
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,545
Not for safety, just it's not fun to go,
I guess, without a man.

461
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:50,149
And I'm in a relationship
and that's what shocked people more.

462
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,850
"Why isn't he going?"

463
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,587
'Cause I'm a comedian, I happen
to be in Europe for some work anyway.

464
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,257
I thought I'd just jaunt over
to Italy for a couple days,

465
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:01,760
and he has a job
and so he can't just do that.

466
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,730
And they're like, "He's abusive."
I'm like, "No, no, he just...

467
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:09,101
He just has a different job,
and I have free time, and...

468
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,838
It'd be a waste to not go to Italy,
it's just two hours away."

469
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:15,741
And they're like,
"He should be by your side for this."

470
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,110
I'm like, "It's not chemo.
I'm just going on a trip.

471
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,678
I'm just going on a trip.

472
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:22,114
It's all good, they have food there,
they have wine,

473
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:25,350
they have people that talk,
it's just like here, it's just like here."

474
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,587
But I don't understand.

475
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:31,256
Obviously, you wanna sometimes
spend time with your partner.

476
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:36,261
But traveling... Why risk the relationship?
Why travel with a partner, right?

477
00:26:36,995 --> 00:26:40,732
I went to Paris once with my husband.
Guess what, now he's my ex-husband. It...

478
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,036
You don't have to travel
with your partner.

479
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:47,673
It's the time that you see them
24 hours a day

480
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:49,308
and everything they do, you're like:

481
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:53,612
"Why are you walking on the plane
using your legs? God!"

482
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,718
When you travel alone, you can eat
with your hands. I don't mean pizza.

483
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,321
I was eating a salad.
I would rub it on. It was great.

484
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,326
The only thing that sucked about my trip,

485
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,262
and I hate to complain
about such a privileged thing

486
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,964
as to go to Italy by myself,

487
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,334
is that I booked a walking tour
'cause I love that stuff.

488
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:20,839
And I booked the ghost tours of Venice,
which I thought was gonna be so fun.

489
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:23,408
I was reading the website,
people were leaving comments.

490
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:26,378
"It was so fun,
then a theater troupe jumped out at us

491
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,080
and they tried to scare us

492
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:32,684
and we saw sites where people
got slaughtered back in the 1700s,

493
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:34,253
we heard these crazy ghost stories

494
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,422
and we saw secret canals
and secret this and secret that."

495
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:40,092
And I was like,
"I want that. I want all the secrets."

496
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,293
So, I signed up for it.

497
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,329
And it was my last night in Venice.

498
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:48,901
And so at the last minute, I checked
my e-mail confirmation from the company.

499
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,270
And I had accidentally booked
a private tour.

500
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:55,440
And I was like, "No. No."
Thank you for understanding.

501
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,143
"I don't wanna walk alone with someone
for 90 minutes.

502
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,745
That's my worst nightmare."

503
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:03,815
And they make me meet him on the bridge,
like some romance story.

504
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:07,352
And he sees me and he goes,
"Is it just you?"

505
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,353
And I go, "Yeah."

506
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,223
And he goes,
"Oh, this breaks my heart."

507
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,058
And he was doing this big thing.

508
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:16,361
"I don't wanna give you
the ghost story tour.

509
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,231
Oh, it's too sad. You're alone in Venice.

510
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:23,769
Oh, no, no, no.
We do the love story tour."

511
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:26,171
I go, "I wanna see where people
got murdered.

512
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:29,241
Tell me about dead babies.
I wanna hear all kinds of crazy shit."

513
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,912
And he asked, "Where is the man?"

514
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:37,382
I don't know if he meant my boyfriend
or "the man" that's coming down on us.

515
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:41,086
I'm like, "If I knew where 'the man' was,
we'd all be free," right? And so...

516
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,491
I didn't know what he was talking about.
He was very concerned, I had to explain,

517
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:51,296
"I'm in a..." You know, like all walking
tours start this way, you explain.

518
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,232
You're in a relationship, very happy.

519
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:55,867
You're just taking sometime alone.
Don't worry.

520
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,337
And then I got down on my knees
and screamed:

521
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,038
"Why, God, I miss him!

522
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,308
I haven't seen a penis in a week!
Oh, God!"

523
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,311
But then we started the tour.

524
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:11,250
But when... The other problem...
Not just being a woman with a man.

525
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,519
When you're anybody with anybody,
when you're alone on a walking tour,

526
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:17,522
they can start taking advantage of you.
So, he was like, "Miss,

527
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,293
if you don't mind, I don't feel so much
like walking tonight."

528
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,128
I'm like, "You picked the wrong job."

529
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:26,064
He's like, "I'm a little tired.

530
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:30,102
It's been a hard day.
I am sad and it's hot.

531
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,204
Could we stand here?"

532
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:33,205
And so I said yes.

533
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,240
I stood under a bridge with a man

534
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,043
while he told me stories
that were not ghost stories

535
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:41,046
for 90 minutes, okay?

536
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,416
And I knew
the inevitable was gonna happen.

537
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,917
I knew it was gonna happen.

538
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:48,987
He asked me... why I was in Italy.

539
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,990
And I said, "For vacation."
He said, "But why alone?"

540
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:56,194
I said, "All right, I was in London
doing some work and I came here."

541
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,829
"What work do you do?"

542
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,965
And I...
I don't wanna tell him I'm a comedian.

543
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,068
You guys, you're nice to comedians
when we're on stage,

544
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,804
but in real life,
people say awful things to us.

545
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,174
They find we're comedians
they're like, "You don't seem funny."

546
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,510
"I'm getting my fucking colon removed,
that's why."

547
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,010
So...

548
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,949
I always have a lie whenever I check-in
to a hotel, get into an Uber.

549
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,985
"What brings you to town?" Shuts them up.

550
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:22,554
"My friend's having an abortion.
I had to come right in.

551
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:30,195
And it's a guy
so it's a weird procedure,

552
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,397
so just please leave me alone.
I don't wanna..."

553
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,234
So, I just tell him I'm a comedian
and then he goes:

554
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,072
"Madam, this is not a provocation...

555
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,209
but your life
does not seem interesting enough

556
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,511
that you have to go around the world
and tell it."

557
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,147
And he's right, isn't he?

558
00:30:53,285 --> 00:30:56,521
And that was how the tour ended
is he said "not a provocation"

559
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,924
and then gave me a big old provocation.

560
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:01,860
And then he did one nice thing.

561
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,329
I was trying to look at the positive,
I'm a meditator.

562
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,400
Is he took me to an Italian restaurant.
Obviously, I was in Italy.

563
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,104
He took me to a restaurant,
I don't have to say Italian restaurant.

564
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,206
"Is this here an Italian restaurant
or what?"

565
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,440
So, he took me...

566
00:31:18,143 --> 00:31:20,379
He took me to a restaurant.
He didn't sit with me,

567
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:21,580
he just brought me there.

568
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,916
And I was actually very grateful
because it was on the Grand Canal

569
00:31:24,983 --> 00:31:27,018
and if you've ever been to anywhere,

570
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:30,389
you sometimes don't know
what's the authentic restaurant

571
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,357
and what is the cheesy tourist place.

572
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,026
And so, I said,
"I never would've picked this place.

573
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,996
I had no idea by looking
at the restaurants on the Grand Canal

574
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,333
what was authentic and what wasn't,
so, thank you for bringing me here."

575
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,269
Now he's standing over my table,
waiter is bringing the wine,

576
00:31:44,336 --> 00:31:48,440
things are starting to happen and he says,
"May I tell you one more story, then?"

577
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:50,275
I go, "Okay."

578
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:53,178
He hadn't told me a ghost story yet,
so I was like, "Maybe this is it."

579
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:58,984
He goes, "You remind me,
there's a story about perception.

580
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:03,255
You bring up you don't know
what restaurant is good based on looks.

581
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:04,623
Isn't that life?

582
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:09,194
You don't know a man or a person,
just based on looking at them,

583
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,262
what's in their soul.

584
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:15,200
Maybe there's a man and he's fun
and he walks and he tells the stories.

585
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,938
But then maybe he goes home
and he kills himself."

586
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:29,281
"Is that it?" He goes, "Yes."

587
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,184
I go, "Okay, well, have a good night.
Thanks for the tour."

588
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,053
What...?

589
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:37,556
"Just keep living."

590
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,628
I was annoyed
because he never told the horror story.

591
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:47,065
He only told me the love story.
I was like, "Oh, that's so... I don't...

592
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,302
Not everyone's meant for this world.
Whatever he wants, I don't care."

593
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,372
But I thought, maybe I should complain.
Like, I don't wanna get him fired,

594
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,441
but I wanna complain
and get my money back

595
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:59,344
and then just have the manager
just tell everyone,

596
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:02,247
"Hey, you know, we can't mess around
with the tours.

597
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:06,117
Give people what they want." So, maybe,
what if I call the manager right now?

598
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,986
What if she was like, "Sergio?

599
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,088
He did not meet you on the bridge at 7."

600
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,223
I'd be like, "He did."

601
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,459
She'd be like, "Oh, no, ma'am,
at 6:30 he killed himself."

602
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:18,196
I'd be like, "Oh, my God,
that was the greatest ghost tour ever!"

603
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:25,337
Yes. Now you like a suicide joke
when it has a little punch to it, right?

604
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:31,576
So, you know, I'm a hypochondriac,
but not...

605
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,645
I don't invent things.

606
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:37,015
It's just that when something happens,
I think it's worse than it is, right?

607
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,718
I had an incident with my doctor
six months ago...

608
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:44,189
where she told me I couldn't come back
for a year even if I really was dying.

609
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,260
Because I had
such a hypochondriacal episode...

610
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,694
and made an ass of myself.

611
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,331
Now, I wanna tell you the story,
but it's gonna be filmed...

612
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:57,035
and now a cliché is gonna be stuck on me.

613
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,771
Because the story also involves my period.

614
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:04,042
And people have a problem
when women talk about their periods.

615
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,677
"People." Men.

616
00:34:05,744 --> 00:34:06,778
So...

617
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:12,384
the common wisdom that people say
is women aren't funny.

618
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,220
Okay, great.
I can't do anything about that.

619
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:18,390
If you don't think I'm funny,
check out other women, right?

620
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:20,592
"Women" is not a type of comedy.

621
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,394
"Women" is a type of person.

622
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,664
I think women are people, I'm not sure.
Anyway, but...

623
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,734
Let's take apart why it's so difficult
to talk about a period.

624
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,305
I think sometimes people just don't know
what a period is.

625
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,207
And so, a man doesn't wanna hear about it
because he's like:

626
00:34:36,274 --> 00:34:38,209
"I feel stupid. I don't know what it is."

627
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,645
And no problem.
They didn't explain it to us either.

628
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,183
I turned 11, mother said,
"You're gonna get your period."

629
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,185
"What's that?"
"A thing you're gonna get."

630
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:50,322
"When?" "Anytime between now
and the next seven years." "Oh, God."

631
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:53,592
And then you're just walking to school
like, "Gonna get my period.

632
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:56,728
What's my period? Comes out of here.
Do I have it? Can anyone see?"

633
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,597
And so, it's... It's...

634
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:02,767
Here's what a period is.
Let's start with education

635
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,237
and get to the fun story
about hypochondria and my period, right?

636
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:08,840
Here we go. In case anyone
doesn't know what a period is,

637
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:13,545
every month a woman sheds the interior
of her uterine lining

638
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,681
because she's not pregnant,
because she's a dirty, dirty whore...

639
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:21,186
who didn't do the one thing
God put her on earth to do,

640
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,754
which is make a baby.

641
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,123
And that's her three-
to-five-day punishment.

642
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,692
So... that's what a period is.

643
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:28,759
Now...

644
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,298
I think men can handle that fact, right?

645
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,669
And I'm not making fun of men. I mean, I...

646
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:42,641
The thing... Men aren't ever mean to us
about our periods when we talk about them.

647
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:45,377
They're never mean to us.
They just don't wanna hear it.

648
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,847
And I understand that
because the world caters to you

649
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:52,217
and you don't have to hear about anything
that you don't know about.

650
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:55,920
And that must be really scary
when you have to, so, we must...

651
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,223
We must be kind to men.

652
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,462
I don't like the old hacky thing of,
"If men had their periods,

653
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:07,932
they'd be like, 'Yeah, blood everywhere.
Gonna name a bar after it. Yeah... '"

654
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,199
You know.

655
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,239
Maybe that'd be true, maybe it wouldn't.
But I don't know if it'd be true

656
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,608
because if men
were the ones getting their periods,

657
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,811
then women would be the ones
not getting their periods.

658
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:22,847
And so, it would be unequal.
And I know what I'm like

659
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,184
when I don't understand things
in a man's body. Know what I mean?

660
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:29,287
Like, "Why do you have balls?"
"'Cause I have them." "Get rid of it."

661
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,890
Like, I'm not necessarily nice.

662
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,761
And so, I wonder what I would be like
if I had a boyfriend who got his period

663
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:39,297
because men get the periods
and I've never had one.

664
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,934
If I'm at dinner... and my boyfriend
comes out of the bathroom and he's like:

665
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,470
"Uh, Jen... we gotta go."

666
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:49,307
"Jonathan, we didn't order
an appetizer yet."

667
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:53,712
"Jen, I just got my period a day early
and I'm wearing white pants.

668
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:54,946
We gotta go. We gotta go."

669
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,916
"Uh, what do you mean
you got your period a day early?

670
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,586
Doesn't it come on the same day
every month? "" No, it's a hormonal thing,

671
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:03,388
it's irregular. I can't control it."

672
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,256
"Oh, I can't control my body.

673
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,958
Oh, it's hormones made me do it.

674
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,493
Come on, you can control it."

675
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,731
"Jen, I can't."
"They have tampons in the bathroom?"

676
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,799
"No, they're out and I... So, we gotta go."

677
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,902
"You have a tampon in your purse,
Jonathan?"

678
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:22,440
"No, I forgot."

679
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,310
"Jonathan, how many times have I told you
be a fucking man

680
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:29,414
and keep a tampon in your purse
in case... you get your period early.

681
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,816
And why wear white pants
anywhere near the week

682
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:33,418
of your expected period?

683
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:36,588
God, what...? How long
have you been getting this, 20 years now?

684
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:41,760
Why can't you do this, Jonathan?
You can leave. I'm eating here.

685
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,696
We've had this reservation for two weeks.
Leave, I'm staying.

686
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:49,801
Go. Tie your jacket around your waist,
Jonathan. Everyone can see your period."

687
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,674
Then I call my friend,
"I'm at a restaurant alone.

688
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,643
Yeah. But Jonathan got his period.

689
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:00,512
No, of course he didn't.

690
00:38:00,979 --> 00:38:03,381
He didn't know it was coming, no.
He never knows.

691
00:38:04,349 --> 00:38:06,451
Oh, like Jonathan had a tampon.
Are you crazy?

692
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:09,888
We're talking about Jonathan. He's the...
I don't know if I can be with him

693
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:14,325
'cause if he can't plan for himself, then,
like, how can he plan for me, you know?"

694
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,897
So, that might be what women are like
if men got their periods.

695
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,365
Here's what happened to me.

696
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,636
Now, my period comes
on the same day every month.

697
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,705
Never been early, never been late.
I don't get cramps. Thank you.

698
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:28,906
So...

699
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:34,913
One morning...
when I was 41 and a half years old

700
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,982
and really feeling it...
just thinking about it,

701
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:40,451
God... almost 50.

702
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,355
I mean, not really,
but... closer than I was when I was 13.

703
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:45,923
Right?

704
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,494
I woke up in the morning
and I went to the ladies' room.

705
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:51,830
There's not a ladies' room in my house.

706
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:56,734
It's not like ladies, men, wheelchair,
you know, it's... I went... I was going pee.

707
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:01,506
And I looked at my underwear
and there were some fresh drops of blood.

708
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,877
Now, again... it was two weeks
from when I was supposed to get my period.

709
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,546
And this
was not uterine lining-looking blood.

710
00:39:09,814 --> 00:39:13,551
This was prick-your-finger fresh blood.
It actually looked like the blood...

711
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,021
that my roommate's cat had
years and years ago.

712
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,693
When I was just a young thing
with a roommate in Brooklyn

713
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:22,861
and she had a dying cat.

714
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:26,130
And the cat dragged its body
across the floor

715
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,968
as little drops of blood came out
because the cat's kidneys were failing.

716
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,805
That's right. And my roommate
had to put the cat in a cage

717
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,607
and the cat got put down that day,

718
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,743
the same day that the blood drops
appeared in the morning.

719
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:43,882
And I looked at myself and I went,
"Today is the day I will be put down.

720
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,020
I don't have a human-sized cage
and I live alone.

721
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,790
I knew if I didn't start a family
this would happen,

722
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,593
but I'll have to put myself down.

723
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,029
I will call the vet
and I will make an appointment."

724
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:01,032
Because I knew that's internal bleeding.

725
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,701
My kidneys are failing.
I have internal bleeding.

726
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:06,638
But before I freaked out,
I checked my vagina for glass.

727
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,506
And so I just wanted to make sure...

728
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:13,778
Because I take sleeping pills sometimes,
you can sleepwalk on those.

729
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:16,447
I wanted to make sure
that in the middle of the night

730
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,917
I didn't start sleepwalking,
then get into a bar fight,

731
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,053
break a bottle, and then put it in me
and you go, "Come at me!"

732
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
So...

733
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:27,125
I called friends, I'm like,
"Did I get in a bar fight with my vagina?"

734
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,794
They're like, "I don't think so."
I was like, "Thanks.

735
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,132
The bad news is then
I must be put down today.

736
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:37,702
It's internal bleeding.
I'm gonna call my doctor."

737
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:41,039
So, I called. I said, "I have to come in.
I have internal bleeding."

738
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:44,208
I get there, she puts me in the stirrups,
which is stupid.

739
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:48,046
I'm like, "This isn't a period thing.
Do an x-ray. I have internal bleeding.

740
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,682
My kidneys are failing. Rapidly. Come on."

741
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,518
She looks up and goes,
"Jen, this is your period."

742
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:56,054
I go, "No, it isn't."
And she goes, "Yes, it is."

743
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,657
"It's not supposed to be here for
two weeks." She goes, "Two weeks early."

744
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:02,760
I go, "Well, I want a second opinion."

745
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:05,129
She goes,
"What do you want a second opinion about?"

746
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,799
I said,
"I still think this is internal bleeding."

747
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,535
And she said, "It's not."
And I said, "How do you know?"

748
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:13,871
And she said, "Because you're seeing
the blood externally."

749
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,509
"Oh, that's such a fucking amazing point.

750
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,078
I never thought about that.

751
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,014
That's why people die
from internal bleeding,

752
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,983
because they don't see the blood.

753
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:26,818
Okay, I got it.

754
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:28,653
Good. All right. I am stupid."

755
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,231
She looked at me and went, "Are you okay?"

756
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:33,891
And I went,
"I don't think so. No, I don't..."

757
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,863
And like a child being handed a toothbrush
by a dentist, she just handed me a tampon

758
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,832
and was like, "Get out of here."
And, um...

759
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,238
Now, the worst part is, I have
a subscription for tampons on Amazon.

760
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:53,077
And I keep forgetting to cancel it,
and so every month, I get so many tampons.

761
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,614
And I have a closet filled with them.
They will outlive me.

762
00:41:57,048 --> 00:42:00,918
I will not... I will be in menopause
before them. I'll be dead.

763
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:03,955
I will one day be in a chair,
no blood left in my body, like:

764
00:42:04,022 --> 00:42:06,991
"I haven't even seen blood on a tooth,
let alone this."

765
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,794
I have no kids,
I have no one to give them to.

766
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,297
I'm the weird lady at Halloween every year
where it's like, "Trick or treat."

767
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:16,134
And I'm like, "You'll be a woman someday.
Yes, take this."

768
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:20,638
Even you, little boy, you never know.
Take it, take it. Take it, everybody."

769
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:26,110
It's amazing what we don't know about
our bodies, we don't think about things.

770
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:29,280
Like, I was taught nothing
about my body growing up.

771
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,184
I didn't lose my virginity until I was
basically almost 22 years old,

772
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:37,221
which I have a lot of shame about.
I think it's kind of old, kind of dorky.

773
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:41,225
And even the person I lost my virginity to
does not know that he took it,

774
00:42:41,292 --> 00:42:46,030
'cause I had to lie that I lost it
at age 16 under a creeping willow tree.

775
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:48,699
You get real detailed
when you lied about stuff, right?

776
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:54,705
I lost my virginity at age 21, but, like,
almost 22, like, 21 and 11 months.

777
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:58,709
And it wasn't 'cause I was a prude.
I wanted to lose my virginity.

778
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,913
It had always been my life's goal
ever since I was a little girl.

779
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,849
Just grow up someday
and lose my virginity.

780
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,086
And the thing that stopped me...
It was a Catholic thing.

781
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:11,889
Well, first of all, I didn't really
understand even what sex was, right?

782
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,925
I mean, I had sex education,
as we all did.

783
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:17,628
They didn't, like, teach you how to fuck,
it was just like...

784
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:22,633
They never said anything about, like,
making love and sensuality, and...

785
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,268
There's never gay people involved.

786
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,071
It was just a man lays next to a woman,
they get pregnant.

787
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,340
I was like, "Why would anyone do that?"
And so...

788
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:32,176
Single bed for life, right? And so...

789
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:37,281
All we had in sex education for the girls,
we had a big poster of fallopian tubes.

790
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,350
And I was like, "Those are inside of me?"

791
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:43,621
They looked giant, like, "Why aren't they
coming out my mouth?" It was just like...

792
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:49,794
And there was just a vagina right there
with an egg right here.

793
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,729
Looked like a ball in a catcher's mitt.

794
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,699
It looked like the egg is always there,
like, "Let's play ball.

795
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:57,034
Impregnate me.
Come on, we'll go around the bases."

796
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:02,406
And then for the boys,
they just had a poster of sperm.

797
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,308
And they taught us

798
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:09,247
in one little drop of semen
there's billions and billions of sperm.

799
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:12,783
I was like, "Okay."
That's all I remembered.

800
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,986
As I got to be a teenager,
my mother was like:

801
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,421
"Never have sex,
you'll get pregnant every time."

802
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:21,859
And I was like, but I think she's right
'cause I thought back to those two signs,

803
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:26,297
the egg waiting and ready
and then billions and billions of sperm.

804
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:30,134
What are the odds? A billion to one.
You're going to have a baby, right?

805
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:33,237
I was like, "How come women just have one?
How come they're aren't like:"

806
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,308
Like, why aren't babies
just, like, spilling out of everybody?

807
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,912
Like, there's billions and billions
of sperm and one egg.

808
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,883
So, I didn't wanna... I didn't wanna,
you know, lose my virginity so fast.

809
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:49,020
It was the Catholic Church's fault.
Like, now, I'm cool with Jesus.

810
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:52,990
I knew Jesus didn't mind if I had sex
'cause Jesus loved whores, right?

811
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:54,292
It's in the Bible.

812
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,161
He hung out with prostitutes,
they were his favorite people.

813
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,231
When he was fed up with the apostles,
"Where are my prostitutes?"

814
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,198
"We're here."

815
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:04,201
He'd be like, "We're not gonna write
about you in the Bible."

816
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,937
And then he was friends with them.

817
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,440
So, I knew that once I had sex,
I would just confess to Jesus,

818
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,044
"I had sex." He'd be like, "I love that."
I'd be like, "Just telling you."

819
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:15,046
And so that would be fine.

820
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,982
What I was afraid of
was getting pregnant.

821
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:21,452
Obviously, I didn't want
to be a teenage mother or a mother period.

822
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,288
I knew if I got pregnant,
I would have to have an abortion

823
00:45:24,355 --> 00:45:27,858
and I was very afraid of abortion
because of church.

824
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,461
Not 'cause of Jesus,
but because of the priest at church.

825
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:34,231
Every single sermon the priest
at my church did were about abortion.

826
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:36,901
Even though it was not in the Bible
that day, you know.

827
00:45:36,968 --> 00:45:39,136
They would be like,
"Merry Christmas, everybody.

828
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,505
And we are here 'cause Mary had a baby.

829
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,875
She kept it even though she didn't know
who the fuck gave it to her.

830
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,244
And we will celebrate Mary.

831
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,512
She didn't have an abortion

832
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,482
like you girls who go to the clubs
and use it as birth control.

833
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,851
Then if you had an abortion,
you go to hell.

834
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:56,854
If you know someone
that's had an abortion, you go to hell.

835
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,991
Guys, don't worry. We'll high-five you.
You got a woman pregnant.

836
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,926
But the women are going to hell."

837
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,161
And I was like,
"I don't wanna go to hell."

838
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,130
I decided I'm never gonna get pregnant

839
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:08,499
and the easiest way to do that
is to never have sex.

840
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,302
And I really didn't understand
what an abortion was.

841
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,205
I didn't know
it was a safe medical procedure

842
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,308
that prevents a pregnancy
from becoming a pregnancy.

843
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:19,510
I thought you carried a baby to full term

844
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,780
and then in a doctor's office,
they, like, shot it in the head.

845
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:24,915
You know, I was like,
"I'm not doing that."

846
00:46:27,885 --> 00:46:29,553
I'm not judging, but I'm not doing that.

847
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,559
So, instead of sex...

848
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,964
Instead of sex,
I was the girl who loved being fingered.

849
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,133
I loved fingering. Loved?

850
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,235
I still love it. I love fingering.

851
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:48,172
I am bringing back fingering.
It's amazing. Do it to everybody.

852
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,809
It's not just for... It's not just
for kids. It's like sugar cereal.

853
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,878
Adults can enjoy it, too. It's wonderful.

854
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,148
You're going right to the source.
Greatest feeling on Earth.

855
00:46:57,214 --> 00:47:01,185
And so... I had a lovely boyfriend
who used to finger me.

856
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,587
And the first time I ever got fingered...
Oh, my God.

857
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,824
I mean, I touched myself before,

858
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:09,894
but when you get to go hands free,
it's like, "Whee!" It's so exciting.

859
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:14,131
And the feeling was so powerful
that after I got fingered,

860
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:17,068
every moment after that
that I wasn't getting fingered,

861
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,271
I was in a deep, dark depression.

862
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,841
That's why when you see
Goth girls walking around,

863
00:47:23,908 --> 00:47:26,377
they're not trying to get attention,
they're upset.

864
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:29,947
They got fingered once
and haven't been fingered since.

865
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:33,451
They're like, "It's so dark. Everything
is horrible. I don't feel anything."

866
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,852
So, anyway...

867
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:39,090
My boyfriend usually went first on me
'cause he was a good guy.

868
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:41,292
But this one time
I wanted to return the favor.

869
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,260
And so I took my two dry hands,

870
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:48,065
and I rubbed his penis up and down
like you do, and it almost caught on fire.

871
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,267
And...

872
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:55,005
So, like a skilled firefighter,
he grabbed it like a hose

873
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,142
and was like, "I got this," you know.

874
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,045
And he came on his hand
like a young man of 17 does,

875
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,013
wiped it on his T-shirt in the basement

876
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,050
and then he kindly went in
to return the favor.

877
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:07,284
All I saw on that finger...

878
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,420
I couldn't see it,
but I knew it was there.

879
00:48:09,587 --> 00:48:11,589
Billions and billions of sperm.

880
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:13,624
I didn't wanna be like:

881
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,103
"Can you wash your hands?
I'm not ready to become a mother."

882
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:17,661
'Cause that's dorky, right?

883
00:48:17,928 --> 00:48:20,397
Then I was like,
"You can't get pregnant from fingering.

884
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:23,300
They would've told us.
They would've told us that in school.

885
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:27,371
Unless they don't know what this is,
and we just invented it."

886
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:31,585
I was like, "I need that good feeling,"
so I let it happen.

887
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:33,177
No consequences. I didn't care.

888
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:36,947
I woke up in the middle of the night
and put my hand on my stomach

889
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:39,550
and I felt a heartbeat and I was like:

890
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:42,286
"Oh, my God. I'm a mother."

891
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:46,023
I was so dumb.

892
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:50,227
I didn't know that you could feel a pulse
anywhere else but your wrist.

893
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,931
That was the first time I had noticed
a pulse anywhere else in my body.

894
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:56,066
And I thought I'd grown a baby
in four hours.

895
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,635
I was like, "Whoo! That happens fast.

896
00:48:58,235 --> 00:49:00,271
No wonder this abortion
is such a hot topic.

897
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,108
There is a living, breathing person
in there."

898
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,677
Well, I couldn't tell my mom.
She'd kill me.

899
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,579
I didn't have the Internet back then,

900
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,982
not just 'cause my mom wouldn't let me,
it wasn't invented yet, okay?

901
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:15,085
So, all I had was a typewriter,
and you can't ask your typewriter:

902
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:18,088
"Can I get fingered,
and then get pregnant from that?"

903
00:49:19,089 --> 00:49:22,459
'Cause your typewriter just has a piece
of paper looking back at you, like:

904
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,362
"I don't know if you can get pregnant.
I'm a typewriter."

905
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:28,165
So, you're just stuck.
It's a standstill, right?

906
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:31,035
So, I had to go... to the library.

907
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,373
And I couldn't ask the librarian
because she was a friend of my mom.

908
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,244
I couldn't be like, "I got finger-blasted.
What do you think, baby or no?"

909
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,583
So, I had to take a walk
to the card catalog.

910
00:49:47,251 --> 00:49:49,253
Which if you're younger
and you don't know,

911
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,989
it's what we had before the Internet
at the library.

912
00:49:52,056 --> 00:49:54,024
It's a catalog filled with cards.

913
00:49:55,092 --> 00:49:58,529
And in it are cards that have the name
of every book in the library.

914
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:01,232
Now, as years go by
and more information is out there,

915
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:03,767
they keep jamming more cards
in the catalog.

916
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:07,171
They don't get extra catalogs, no, no.
Just shove it in the one.

917
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:09,073
You put your finger in and take a risk.

918
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,075
You might not get your finger back.
Like, "Aah!"

919
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:14,445
And so I had to look
for books about pregnancy.

920
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:18,349
Now, again, the card catalog
is not in alphabetical order. No, no, no.

921
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,018
It is in something
called the Dewey Decimal System,

922
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,187
which is a complicated series of numbers

923
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:25,589
that librarians have to go to college
to learn.

924
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,293
But they throw it in the lobby at us,
like, "You'll figure it out."

925
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:33,330
And so... I find books on pregnancy

926
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,700
and, you know, of course, it doesn't
just say pregnancy and then aisle P.

927
00:50:36,767 --> 00:50:39,069
No, I have to memorize, like, 12 numbers.

928
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:42,239
And so, back then we used to be smart.
We could memorize 12 numbers.

929
00:50:42,306 --> 00:50:44,108
We didn't have to take a picture
or anything.

930
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,609
And so...

931
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:49,813
Then I walked all the way back...
to the shelves.

932
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,150
I didn't give an example of the 12-number
thing 'cause I'm too stupid now.

933
00:50:53,217 --> 00:50:57,321
There was no book <i>What to Expect If You're</i>
<i>Expecting 'Cause You've Been Fingered,</i>

934
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,522
so I was like, "Argh!"

935
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,593
So, I just didn't do anything.
If I had been pregnant,

936
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,829
it would've been like those TV shows
where I just have it in a toilet.

937
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:10,801
But nine months later, when no baby came,
I was like, "I must have miscarried.

938
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,370
So tragic, but so right for me, you know."

939
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,842
So, then I found out.
I found out all the facts.

940
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:21,321
The egg's not sitting there,
it only comes once in a while.

941
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:23,647
And if you use condoms
it's 99.9 percent effective.

942
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:25,749
I was like,
"I gotta lose my virginity then."

943
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:29,286
But my boyfriend and I had broken up
and I was about to go to college,

944
00:51:29,353 --> 00:51:31,622
I was like, "How am I gonna
lose my virginity now?

945
00:51:31,722 --> 00:51:35,626
I don't know anyone at college yet. What,
am I gonna walk in and go to a guy and go,

946
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:39,163
"Wanna have sex?" They have to be in love
before they do that.

947
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:42,700
I didn't know anything.

948
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:48,272
And then I thought,
"Wait, how am I gonna get a guy

949
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:50,841
to be interested in me
unless he thinks I'm experienced?

950
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,588
No guy wants to sleep with a virgin."

951
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,679
I didn't know that either.

952
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,483
So, I spread a rumor about myself.

953
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:07,324
I told everyone that at age 18,
entering college in 1992,

954
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:09,226
that I had already fucked ten guys.

955
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:11,829
That's a lot, ten guys.
I mean, not now, but then.

956
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,231
That was a lot. Ten guys at 18 was a lot.

957
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,800
Some people don't have ten people
in their town. Ten guys.

958
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:20,371
And 1992 was an innocent, innocent time.

959
00:52:20,671 --> 00:52:22,673
<i>Beverly Hills, 90210,</i> Brenda and Dylan,

960
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,442
they waited a year
to lose their virginity to each other.

961
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,445
Dylan was an alcoholic
who lived by himself. He was a virgin.

962
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,147
It was an innocent time.

963
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,754
So, no guys wanted to have sex with me
because they thought I had an STD

964
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,222
because I'd fucked ten guys.

965
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,925
And so, I went year after year after year
not getting laid

966
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:45,396
until I met someone who transferred
into my college my senior year

967
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,798
and he hadn't heard the rumors
and I didn't tell him.

968
00:52:47,865 --> 00:52:50,934
We had sex, it was fun, it was fine.
I don't remember every detail

969
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,371
'cause it was long ago, but it was lovely.
And I walked home that day,

970
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:57,541
just, you know, listening to my Discman,
listening to Madonna,

971
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:01,378
you know, <i>Bedtime Stories</i> album. I'm like,
"I get it. I'm sexual, too, Madge."

972
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:03,347
And, um...

973
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:05,649
But something stopped me dead
as I was walking

974
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:08,519
and I was like,
"Wait a minute, my hymen didn't break."

975
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:12,890
That's another thing they teach us girls.
We have a hymen. It's a piece of skin

976
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,492
that's somewhere in our vagina
and a penis pokes it

977
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,829
and we bleed and get sheets dirty
and we suck, fuck you, you're dumped.

978
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:20,898
So, now...

979
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,468
my hymen didn't break
and I was like, "Uh-oh.

980
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:27,671
I hope my hymen didn't get pushed up
into my body

981
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:30,374
and now it's strangling,
you know, my internal organs."

982
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:35,446
I don't even know what a hymen is.
How strong is it? How does it work?

983
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,215
And I was like, "I gotta go to a doctor."

984
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,585
And so, I went to the school nurse,
but I didn't wanna act

985
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:44,521
like I just lost my virginity,
so, I tried to play it all "cas."

986
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,391
I walked in, I was like,
"Hey, quick question.

987
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,760
Um...

988
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,799
When I lost my virginity,
whenever that was...

989
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:57,000
uh...

990
00:53:57,634 --> 00:53:59,703
my hymen didn't break.
What's up with that?"

991
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:03,807
She was like,
"That's an old wive's tale.

992
00:54:03,874 --> 00:54:05,542
It's fine. If you've used a tampon

993
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,545
or ridden a horse or took a dance class
it can stretch, it can break."

994
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:09,612
I go:

995
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:14,351
"Okay, it can't get shoved up
and start strangling your organs?"

996
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,653
"No, it's a tissue."
"Can it get wadded up and...?"

997
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,356
"No, not a tissue. Like, it's a..."

998
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:20,657
I go, "Oh, okay, okay."

999
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,629
She looks at my chart like,
"About to turn 22." She goes:

1000
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:29,800
"So, you didn't just lose your virginity,
did you?" "No, I fucked like ten guys."

1001
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,603
And that's when I got my first STD test.

1002
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,738
So...

1003
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,274
So, I'm in a relationship,

1004
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:40,043
and I don't have jokes about it
because it's a nice story.

1005
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,514
I'm with someone that I love a lot,
we've known each other for a long time...

1006
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,180
And look at you get quiet.
No one likes nice things, I understand.

1007
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,822
But there was a time in my life
when I was what I call "single" single,

1008
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:54,625
when I was like,
"God, like, no one seems to like me."

1009
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:57,327
I wasn't getting picked
and I didn't like how it felt.

1010
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:00,697
And I read a self-help book that was like,
take yourself on a self date.

1011
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:03,333
And so, I did that.
And I would sit at bars

1012
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,603
and... guys would come up and go,
"Can I sit here?" I go, "No.

1013
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:11,308
I'm also sitting there, please stop.

1014
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:16,480
I'm on a... I'm on a date with myself,
so, would you please?"

1015
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:19,917
I started saying bullshit things,

1016
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:23,854
you know, after reading these books, like,
"You know what? Gonna take some time.

1017
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:27,057
Can't love someone till you love yourself,
you know?" What bullshit.

1018
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,326
You can love someone
when you don't love yourself.

1019
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:31,862
What a fun distraction, right? So...

1020
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,667
But my friend did this.
She decided to have a party.

1021
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:40,037
She called it Facebook in Real Life.
And she invited a bunch of people...

1022
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:46,109
Really good idea. She invited people
that sort of know each other.

1023
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:48,946
You could vouch for someone
if you don't know them well.

1024
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,349
So, you could be like, "Oh, hey,
John's fun. He's a murderer, though.

1025
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:54,651
Don't go home with him,
but fun at parties. Okay."

1026
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:57,487
They're like, "Oh, cool."
I met this guy, really nice guy.

1027
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:58,589
He was age appropriate,

1028
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,724
we got each other's numbers,
started texting.

1029
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:03,393
We liked the same things,
talked about the same stuff.

1030
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,896
He didn't send a dick pic,
nothing inappropriate.

1031
00:56:05,963 --> 00:56:08,865
I felt respected and then, you know,
after a couple of weeks,

1032
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:12,402
he asked me to go have wine with him.
I was like, "We're going on date."

1033
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,005
We're sitting there
and drinking and talking.

1034
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:17,507
I'm not getting a vibe
he wants to sleep with me,

1035
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,576
but I'm like,
"I'll loosen him up a little."

1036
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:21,778
Waitress comes and she's like,
"Want a third?"

1037
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:26,016
We do that dance you do when you,
"I don't normally drink more than two.

1038
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:29,753
Do you? I don't. I could if you...
I... You will? I'll have one, yeah.

1039
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,622
We're gonna fuck.
Yeah, we're gonna fuck.

1040
00:56:31,688 --> 00:56:33,657
Bring a third."

1041
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,426
So, she brings the third.

1042
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,105
As I'm taking a sip, he's like,
"Anyway, my girlfriend..."

1043
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:40,931
I'm like, "Pfft! Your fucking what?

1044
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:42,966
What kind of shit is this?"

1045
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,067
I don't say that, but...

1046
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:47,904
No, I act interested.
I'm like, "Tell me about your girlfriend?"

1047
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:49,773
And...

1048
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,110
Nothing wrong hanging out with a woman
if you have girlfriend.

1049
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,479
Absolutely nothing.
I have tons of male friends.

1050
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,582
But that's it, the door is shut.
Thank you, I have male friends.

1051
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:00,651
I don't need any more.
I don't need any more.

1052
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,687
I have plenty, right?
I didn't understand what his angle was.

1053
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,923
I said, "Does your girlfriend get upset
that you go out with women?"

1054
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:10,093
He goes, "Oh, no, she knows I love women.
I'm a male feminist."

1055
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,863
I go, "'I'm a male feminist.'

1056
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:16,633
Thanks so much for being on our side,
male fucking..."

1057
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,970
If I wanna fucking drink wine
with a feminist, I'll stay home by myself

1058
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:21,738
and I might even get laid. I...

1059
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,176
And my fingers do not have billions
and billions of sperm.

1060
00:57:27,978 --> 00:57:30,948
I started to figure it out, like,
"I see how life is different.

1061
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:34,518
I see how it's different." Back in the
day, men would marry the woman

1062
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,453
that cooks and cleans and has the babies

1063
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,655
and he starts to look at her
more like a mother.

1064
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:41,191
So, he needs to get sex on the side.
Now, men are smart.

1065
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,061
They live with the sex
and they want the brains on the side.

1066
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,798
Well, me and all the other women
are not gonna be your mind whores, dude,

1067
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:48,732
all right?

1068
00:57:48,865 --> 00:57:51,768
You're not gonna finger her
then come out, have a drink with me

1069
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:54,871
and talk about documentaries
until midnight, you pig!

1070
00:57:56,907 --> 00:57:58,175
Thank you.

1071
00:57:58,241 --> 00:58:02,679
So... we're not friends anymore,
but I really...

1072
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:07,184
I know it sounds like I hate men.
I really don't. I love men

1073
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:09,586
and I look at them
the way I look at children,

1074
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:13,023
which is like, "Oh, my God, for people
who don't know what you're doing,

1075
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:15,125
you have so much energy about it,
you know."

1076
00:58:15,192 --> 00:58:19,129
But... the... The one...

1077
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,968
The one area that is really cool,
I like that people say they're feminist,

1078
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:28,905
and it's like, you know, white people can
say they identify for Black Lives Matter,

1079
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,607
and men can say they're feminist.

1080
00:58:30,674 --> 00:58:34,711
It's really cool. There's one area, though
that I don't know why we can't nip this,

1081
00:58:34,778 --> 00:58:37,814
it would be so quick and easy to do,
is street harassment.

1082
00:58:37,881 --> 00:58:41,118
It is still a thing
that we are shouting at some men

1083
00:58:41,218 --> 00:58:45,022
to understand, you know,
that it is a really serious scary thing.

1084
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:49,559
And I feel like if you're going to yell
out of your car at a woman, commit to it.

1085
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,829
Get an old-timey car with a horn
that's like, "Aooga!"

1086
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,532
It's so stupid.

1087
00:58:56,733 --> 00:59:01,271
So, you know, mo... All of my guy friends
are not idiots, they do not act this way,

1088
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,141
but I found out one of my friends
who I respect does this.

1089
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:07,778
I'm like, "You street harass?"
"It's not harassment, it's a compliment."

1090
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:11,014
And I go, "What kind of things do you do?"
"I've yelled, 'Nice tits.'"

1091
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,116
"You yell 'Nice tits' at a woman?"

1092
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:14,584
He goes, "Her tits were nice."

1093
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,320
"I understand the inspiration behind that,
I'm just...

1094
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,792
You can't do that to us.
It's... It's... It's scary."

1095
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,628
He goes, "What's scary about 'Nice tits'?"
I go, "Well..."

1096
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:28,832
He goes, "It's a compliment."
I go, "I get it. Let me take this apart.

1097
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:35,238
I get on its face that 'nice tits, '
dictionary, technically a compliment, yes.

1098
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:39,810
But we don't know, if we don't respond
the way that you want us to respond,

1099
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,746
or if we don't respond at all,
'nice tits' can be followed up

1100
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:45,949
with, 'Fuck you, bitch, '
and then we get scared."

1101
00:59:46,016 --> 00:59:47,684
And my friend goes, "Oh, I got it.

1102
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:51,588
What if I just yell 'nice tits'
but don't yell 'fuck you, bitch' after?"

1103
00:59:51,655 --> 00:59:53,790
I'm like, "No, but we don't...

1104
00:59:53,857 --> 00:59:56,293
We don't know. We don't know.
'Nice tits... '"

1105
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,097
Compliments and murder
both start with compliments.

1106
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:02,866
So, we don't know. We don't know.
We don't know

1107
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:04,093
when someone says "nice tits"

1108
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:07,037
if it's just, beep, beep,
"Nice tits, bye," and they drive off,

1109
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,738
or if it's gonna be
like, "Nice tits"

1110
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,173
stop the car and like,

1111
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,076
'"Nice tits. So nice. Gonna chop them up,
put them in a blender.

1112
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:14,945
Then I'm gonna put them in a freezer

1113
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:18,014
and make tits pops. Tits, tits, tits.'"
We don't know.

1114
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,688
So, my friend goes, "What should I say?"
I go, "Just say nothing. Say no words.

1115
01:00:24,754 --> 01:00:25,789
Say no words."

1116
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:29,259
He goes, "That's my free speech.
That's free speech. You can't do that."

1117
01:00:29,326 --> 01:00:31,361
I go, "It's not...
Whatever free speech means.

1118
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,896
But, okay, fine, free speech.

1119
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:37,200
I didn't say you couldn't say 'nice tits, '
I said, please don't yell it to us.

1120
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:40,170
So, maybe if you're driving by a woman
who has nice tits,

1121
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:43,206
you roll up your window
and smash your face against the glass

1122
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:45,275
and just go, 'Nice tits.'
You could do that.

1123
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,879
Or see a woman with nice tits
and call a friend and go,

1124
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:51,848
'Nice tits, nice tits, I see nice tits.
Okay. Nice tits.'

1125
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:56,419
Or if you have the time,
veer off the road, go into a field,

1126
01:00:56,686 --> 01:01:01,224
get on your knees and let God know.
'Nice tits!'"

1127
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,937
My friend and I could not come
to any agreement on this.

1128
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,206
And so, I was like, "Maybe he's right."

1129
01:01:16,273 --> 01:01:20,210
If we just yell, "No, no, no,"
guys just hear their mothers:

1130
01:01:21,278 --> 01:01:25,048
So, we can't just say, "Don't say this,
don't..." Maybe there's a middle ground.

1131
01:01:25,115 --> 01:01:27,784
Maybe there's something you can say.
I don't know what it is.

1132
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,787
But I had an experience recently
that gave me kind of an idea.

1133
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:33,957
So, I was in North Carolina
and I was walking by myself.

1134
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:37,794
And I was on the side of the road
and it was dusk.

1135
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,063
And a white guy in a truck... drove by.

1136
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:43,767
And then he stopped...
and he pulled back...

1137
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,303
and he just stared at me out the window.

1138
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:48,805
And I was like, "Oh, fuck."

1139
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,275
Because if you're a woman
or not white or gay

1140
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:55,946
and you're walking alone in the South
and a white guy in a truck pulls up,

1141
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:59,115
you know in 20 minutes
there's gonna be candles and flowers

1142
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:01,484
right where you were standing, right?
That's... Yeah.

1143
01:02:02,819 --> 01:02:05,222
Guy rolls down his window and goes,
"Excuse me, ma'am.

1144
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,457
You mind if I say something real creepy
to you?"

1145
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,164
And like an idiot,
I walk up to the truck. "Okay."

1146
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:19,769
And then I get mad and I think of...
I take a minute and think of all the women

1147
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:22,872
from real... Real severe street harassment,
acid in the face

1148
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:25,842
to just little infractions
like "nice tits," and I'm like, "No.

1149
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:30,113
No, you cannot say something creepy."
I go, "No, you cannot and fuck you."

1150
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,283
I start walking away proud of myself
and realize, "I look crazy."

1151
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:36,219
That's what happens,
is if you're talking to a girl in a bar

1152
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:37,187
and it's going well

1153
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:39,956
and after a minute she's just like,
"Fuck you!"

1154
01:02:40,023 --> 01:02:41,291
"What did I do?" "Nothing."

1155
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,094
But we're taught to be polite
and so, we're holding it in.

1156
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,429
All we have to say is,
"I don't feel like talking."

1157
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:50,166
But we talk and we're like, "Eat shit!"
And you're very confused. And so...

1158
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,369
We have to get better at that.
And so, anyway...

1159
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:56,172
he goes, "Ma'am, I didn't mean
to scare you. I'm sorry. I..."

1160
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,777
I just wanted to say I love your boots.
That's it, I love your boots.

1161
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:03,046
I was wearing big, black platform boots,
he goes:

1162
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,348
"I'm a married man.
I'm not trying to pick you up.

1163
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:08,918
I've never noticed fashion in my life.
Well, I have one more question."

1164
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:11,121
"Here comes a creepy question."
I go, "What?"

1165
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:14,891
He goes, "Are they comfortable?" "Yeah."
"That's a win-win for you, ain't it?"

1166
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:15,958
I'm like:

1167
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:23,233
And he said, "Thank you. Thank you
for letting me give you that compliment.

1168
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,140
I couldn't have lived with myself
if I hadn't."

1169
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:29,873
And then he drove off. I was like,
"He couldn't have lived with himself

1170
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:33,343
if he didn't give me that compliment."
That is so dramatic.

1171
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,112
And again,
it is hard for men in the world.

1172
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:37,547
We must be kind to them.

1173
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:40,950
And so...
But part of me is evil and I was like:

1174
01:03:41,017 --> 01:03:44,254
"God, it would've been great
if I didn't let him compliment me."

1175
01:03:44,454 --> 01:03:48,358
Somehow I got to see the rest of his life
played out, that deep regret, you know.

1176
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:51,194
It's just like some kind of play
set in the South

1177
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:53,396
and he's just at home every night
and he's like:

1178
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,836
"I'm not hungry tonight, Martha."
She's like, "Henry, I made your favorite.

1179
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:02,405
Two nights and you haven't eaten it.
You're all bones.

1180
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:08,478
"Are you cheating on me, Henry?"
"No, Martha, it's not about sex.

1181
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:12,015
Sometimes things are about... fashion.

1182
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:20,190
Son, if you ever get the chance
to compliment a woman and don't take it,

1183
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,325
you might not be able to live
with yourself.

1184
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:24,227
Listen to your daddy."

1185
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:29,466
He's on his death bed, his father is like,
"Son, any more wisdom before you go?"

1186
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,402
And he's just like, "Black boots,"
and then he dies.

1187
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,172
No one knows what he means.
His wife never understood.

1188
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,409
"Black boots? I know what that means.
His daddy was in the war.

1189
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:43,279
His daddy wore black boots. He wants
to wear his daddy's boots in his coffin."

1190
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:46,516
And he doesn't. She's shoving
the daddy's boots on his corpse feet.

1191
01:04:46,583 --> 01:04:49,919
And he's up in heaven, like,
"That's not the black boots I meant.

1192
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:53,123
I like women's shoes.
That's right, Jesus, I like women's shoes.

1193
01:04:53,189 --> 01:04:54,524
I can be myself up here."

1194
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,493
So...

1195
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:57,927
that's when I started to think.

1196
01:04:58,161 --> 01:05:03,233
The compliment, if you must yell at us,
yell about our outfit, not our bodies.

1197
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:06,469
We don't wanna think about the fact
we have a body every five minutes,

1198
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,572
and you make us think about it
all the time, and we don't want to.

1199
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,509
You know that feeling
when you just have keys and your phone

1200
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:15,478
and you feel so free?
We'd love to feel that way at the bank,

1201
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:18,448
but can't take our tits and vagina
and leave them on the table.

1202
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:22,018
So, we've got to take these things
even at 8:30 in the morning.

1203
01:05:22,085 --> 01:05:26,055
We're like, "Oh, God, everyone's looking."
And, you know... And if someone is like:

1204
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:29,292
"Nice ass," but we don't feel good,
we're like, "Is that sarcastic?"

1205
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,027
It's a whole mind fuck, right?

1206
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,664
But if you just compliment clothes,
we can all get along, right?

1207
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,133
If you wanna street harass us
and you drive by

1208
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,070
and you're like, "Sweetheart.
Hey, honey... that little bow

1209
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:44,474
matches that detail in your shoes.
That is not lost on me, baby.

1210
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:49,612
I love a good accessory.
I hope you're going to dinner tonight.

1211
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,149
Doesn't have to be with a man,
could be by yourself. You seem unafraid.

1212
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:56,419
I like that. You're walking
with your job and your freedom.

1213
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:59,989
And I'm not threatened by that at all.
I don't have to man-splain to you.

1214
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,725
I'm just letting you know
that a plaid and a polka dot

1215
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,432
can sometimes match. You go, toots."

1216
01:06:05,528 --> 01:06:08,031
Thank you guys so much.
You've been amazing.

1217
01:06:09,232 --> 01:06:10,266
Thanks again.

1218
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:13,969
JKL.

1219
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:34,523
Jennifer.

1220
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:36,059
- Oh!
- Sweetheart.

1221
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:39,095
- Hi.
- Lovely to see you.

1222
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:41,464
- You looked so gorgeous up there.
- Mom. Oh, thank you.

1223
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:44,434
- Jennifer, what's all this food?
- Oh, that's part of my rider.

1224
01:06:44,534 --> 01:06:46,369
- What's a rider?
- It's like, you know,

1225
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:48,571
food they bring backstage.
Part of your budget.

1226
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:51,207
- You like the show?
- They take this out of your pay?

1227
01:06:51,274 --> 01:06:53,710
This is wasteful.
Jennifer, you're not good with money.

1228
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,513
It's not my money.
Didn't like the show or anything or...?

1229
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,582
Oh, my God. No. Mom, Dad, get out,
we're filming. We're filming. Cut.

1230
01:06:59,649 --> 01:07:01,784
- Jennifer, who is this?
- Filming what?

1231
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:04,587
- This is my real family.
- Still speeding.

1232
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:07,257
- We can still roll on this?
- Why would you do this?

1233
01:07:07,323 --> 01:07:10,026
Why would you hire people to play us?
We're here.

1234
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:12,362
Well, that's you. It's already done.

1235
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:16,666
She doesn't look like me.
I have blond hair. She has gray hair.

1236
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:18,301
And I'm not Oriental, Jen.

1237
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,237
Oh, my God, Dad, don't...
That's racist. You're...

1238
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:22,304
I'm Japanese.

1239
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,308
Oh, Jennifer's best friend at school
was Japanese

1240
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,578
and she taught Jennifer
how to say the word "hello."

1241
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,148
- "<i>Konichiwa."</i>
<i>- Konichiwa.</i>

1242
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:34,684
But it doesn't matter.
<i>Konichiwa</i> to you.

1243
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:38,655
Listen, these are actors hired
to represent the character

1244
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:40,690
of Jen Kirkman, right?
That make it better?

1245
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,693
What? There's no character
based on your sister, Gail?

1246
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,528
Okay, Gail, I would've put you in it,

1247
01:07:45,595 --> 01:07:48,064
but you told me
when I used to have that joke

1248
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:50,466
about how you got caught smoking pot,
you said:

1249
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:54,604
"Don't put me in your act anymore." So,
I do not say anything about you anymore

1250
01:07:54,671 --> 01:07:55,671
out of respect.

1251
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,842
Jen, you just told that story again...
on camera.

1252
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,613
That's what she does,
she talks about everybody.

1253
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,248
She called Dad a racist.

1254
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:08,851
- He said, "Oriental."
- Maybe we can take a break.

1255
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:11,621
Yeah. Where's the pizza?
Did you get any pizza?

1256
01:08:11,688 --> 01:08:13,856
No, I didn't get any pizza.
I just did a show.

1257
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,792
And I'm sorry, there's no part for you,

1258
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:18,728
and the reason is not because
I didn't think you'd be good,

1259
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:21,698
but you'd make a scene.
It's happening. You're making a scene.

1260
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,434
I'm not all comfortable.
I'm really not comfortable.

1261
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:28,338
- You're not comfortable? How do we feel?
- Jen, why do you ruin everything?

1262
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:30,707
- Yeah. Jeez, you know.
- I know a great place, guys.

1263
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,408
- You do?
- We should just leave.

1264
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,244
- Just forget about her.
- Were you in the audience,

1265
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:37,347
- because I didn't see you out there.
- Yeah.

1266
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:42,885
Can we use any of that?
Can we use any of that

1267
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:45,455
because my parents
just ruined my Netflix special

1268
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:47,223
and it was kind of fucking awesome.
