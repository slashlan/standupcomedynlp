1
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:22,188
You're... You're... You're... fun,
you're talented, you're great.

2
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,399
Look at this face. Look, right?

3
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,318
All the positivity,
you take it out there...

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:30,155
By the way, this is a small room,
75 people,

5
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,365
but play like it's 80.

6
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,579
And act happy, you hear me?
We always have to look happy.

7
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,165
Oh, cos that's how you're happy?

8
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,625
-Fuck.

9
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>comedy's national treasure, Todd Glass!</i>

10
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,227
What I...

11
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,692
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

12
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,861
I did not expect this.

13
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,697
Get a close up of this fucker
right over here.

14
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,075
You watch this...

15
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,994
That's right, everybody.

16
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,497
I know what I'm doing.

17
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,465
Some guys wouldn't do this much,
but I go for it.

18
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,801
If it costs extra, I don't give a shit.

19
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,643
Woah!

20
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,731
How you enjoying my standup so far?
Shut up!

21
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,739
Sure I play it big.

22
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,742
Sure I play it big. Enough already, right?

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,661
What?

24
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,956
Watch this.

25
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,791
Wow, let's get started, right?

26
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:52,589
I wanna let you know I'm not going to do
insult crowd work.

27
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,799
As a matter of fact, I won an award

28
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,468
for doing the most positive crowd work.

29
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,138
-I won an award--
-Oh, I won an award!

30
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,391
Well, I don't know
if it's that big of a deal--

31
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:06,269
I'm so fancy.
I'm Todd Glass, I win awards!

32
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,645
Well, I don't--

33
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,064
I wonder if it was a trophy
or a medal?

34
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,650
It must be one of them,
because it's an award.

35
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,694
-I'm gonna put it in my fridge!
-Wow!

36
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,198
Was it voted on
by his peers or by a board?

37
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,201
I won an award
as I do positive crowd work.

38
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,245
A lot of comedians come out,
"Where..." Leave people alone.

39
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,497
People are insecure.
They go out to feel better.

40
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,210
I do positive crowd work,
proving you can do it but still be nice.

41
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,421
For instance,
I really like your tattoos, they're...

42
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,466
See, that's funny.
You people don't know it.

43
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,551
Yeah. I love your bow tie...

44
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,388
Because I don't want to be one
of those comedians

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,766
who makes fun of the wrong groups.

46
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,268
You ever see comedy,
see a comedian like, "Oh...

47
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:51,356
"I'm pretty sure
he's throwing a verbal blow

48
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,775
"to a group of people
that might need a hug."

49
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:57,654
That looks shitty years later
when you watch your comedy

50
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,989
like, "I should've been
hugging those people,

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,742
not taking comedic blows at them."

52
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,579
"They're already getting the shit beat out
of them, I should defend them."

53
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,914
That is why,

54
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,709
may I get some reverb so people know
I'm really talking about something?

55
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,380
That is why, ladies and gentlemen,
that I had a joke...

56
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,175
about above-the-ground pools.

57
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,679
And I took it out of my act.
I'm not lying, folks.

58
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,014
I had a joke, every night
I'd come out here,

59
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,434
"Oh, above the ground pools..."

60
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,980
What if there's somebody
in this audience who has one?

61
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,858
The odds are, if you had to bet,
you'd say, "There's one."

62
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,487
They'd have to watch my show like,
"What's this joke about pools?

63
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,573
"Is our pool like a joke, or something?"

64
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:47,078
First of all, I won't do the joke
as I said I didn't do it.

65
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,958
I think you're like, "Can you tell us
what it was?" Sure.

66
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:57,005
But I won't sell it, "Hey, these pools..."
I used to really sell it. "Hey..."

67
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:02,260
But all I'm saying is
if you have an above-the-ground pool,

68
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,513
at least dig a hole and hide it,
that's all.

69
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,060
That would be great music
to have in real life.

70
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,565
Like if your credit card got declined.
"Sorry it's been declined."

71
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,192
You're like, "Oh, that's not..."

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,322
Is K

73
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:28,286
What don't they get? I'm being serious.
I hope it's funny, but you go, "Yeah..."

74
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:33,416
Everyone mocks it for being a shithole,
nobody goes, "What's the problem?"

75
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:38,504
You know, don't they see that Target...
Here's the business plan for Target...

76
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,883
"We'll sell what K-Mart sells,
but wipe shit off."

77
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,553
"Oh, yeah!
I think there might be something there."

78
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,016
Ever noticed inside Target
there's Starbucks?

79
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,604
It's a pretty good idea, two companies
that believe in customer satisfaction

80
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,899
can share a building,
most people don't think of it.

81
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,067
But I did one day...

82
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,861
"They're two different companies
sharing a building."

83
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,865
You have to agree on cleanliness,
on customer satisfaction.

84
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,241
I had a good idea.

85
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,286
Why don't they take...

86
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,083
K-Marts, right,
it's a good idea, seriously,

87
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,210
get past the laughter of it and go...

88
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,338
"Oh, yeah, this is actually a good idea!"

89
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,467
Take K-Marts and put 7-Elevens inside.
What do you think?

90
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,428
They can have
a big "who gives a shit?" festival.

91
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:30,807
Two companies that could give a fuck
about the consumer.

92
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,809
God bless 'em, you know?

93
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:38,147
They go,  "We're not like other companies,
'wipe things, customers are coming.'"

94
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,317
7-Eleven, this could be their motto:
"7-Eleven...

95
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,821
"We're open!" Maybe? I don't know.
Put a button on that.

96
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,413
Now I want to talk about Subway.
Sure, I go big.

97
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,459
Subway, it's not their food
I have a problem with,

98
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,753
it's their... look, it's too bright.

99
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,130
It's too bright.

100
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,841
It's so bright.
Put a lower bulb in there.

101
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,970
Whenever I say this, people go,

102
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,265
"All right, Todd, I agree
with your atmosphere shit but..."

103
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,559
I go, "Ha ha ha!"

104
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,978
That's funny, cos you know,
if ten years ago I'd said,

105
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,063
"Airlines should lower their lights,
use blue lights.

106
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,982
People would go, "OK, Todd..."

107
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,693
But Virgin America did it.
They fucking got it!

108
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,779
Oh! How much more money is it

109
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:29,449
to have people get on a plane
that's not too fucking bright?

110
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,368
Oh, it's free?
Everyone else is just a dumb fuck?

111
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:38,833
Fly Virgin American just cos someone said,
"We don't have to look ugly we fly!"

112
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:46,090
I don't want to make anyone feel bad.
My goal is to make people change.

113
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,302
Even...
Is everything a joke to you, lady?

114
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,055
It probably is, you come out,
"Ha ha ha."

115
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,728
But I really do want people
to realize... I'll give you an example,
I'm being serious.

116
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,942
Most of your lights
at home  are too bright, OK?

117
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,361
I know you're like, "Shu... Huh?"

118
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:10,990
When you have people over your house,
it's too bright.

119
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,744
I imagine everyone's thinking about when
they have people over,

120
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,496
going, "I don't think mine are."

121
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:20,124
No one goes, "Mine are too bright,
I don't give a fuck." No, no.

122
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,877
People think lights go way up,
so they turn them up.

123
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,923
That's where the mistake starts,
because "the light goes up to there."

124
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:30,384
Do you turn everything way up?
How about the volume on your stereo?

125
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,179
I turn everything all the way up.
The oven if cooking.

126
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,139
It's up, it goes all the way up.

127
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,936
If you're sitting there now...
some people may think I'm right, others may say they know how
to set their houses up,

128
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:46,442
"I'm not perfect but not the worst."
You might be.

129
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,821
Go home and look at your hallway,
bathroom lighting.

130
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,533
When people come over,
the bathroom you provide for them.

131
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,327
If you go look at it
without boxing gloves on,

132
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,748
if you look at it and go, "Fuck.
He's right! I'm not in the gray area."

133
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,669
Let yourself off the hook.
But if you don't go, "What the fuck?"

134
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,046
That's the room you provide people.

135
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,175
Even if you're not purposefully doing it,
you're going, "When people come over,

136
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,179
"I have a room
that leaves them feeling shitty.

137
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:19,600
"They'll look fat, look sweaty,
they'll look bloated. I give them that."

138
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,603
Restaurant are the same,
their bathrooms are too bright.

139
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,939
I go, "I hope you don't sell desserts
and go out of business."

140
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,692
You know what else?

141
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,320
Can Whole Foods help me out
with the bins of candy everywhere?

142
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,699
It's seriously hard not to eat it. I smoke pot, that's not an excuse,

143
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,412
cos what's not yours is not yours,

144
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,373
but you go in,
there are bins of candy just there.

145
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,711
Can't they put Velcro for some resistance?

146
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,462
You know, I have a good idea.

147
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,549
Can't they weigh you when you
come in and when you leave?

148
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:55,011
I'd be OK with that,  so I could graze.
Lighten the ropes.

149
00:09:56,304 --> 00:10:00,308
Sometimes when I have visitors,
I stage my refrigerator.

150
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,685
I head to Whole Foods to do it.

151
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,397
Like that wink? Don't put it in.
It was cheesy. Who am I?

152
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,774
Next I'll be kissing people
and doing this...

153
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:14,030
Waving at fake people
in the audience - an old trick.

154
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,325
People at home,
"I guess he knows a lot of people."

155
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,536
What am I, Wayne Newton?

156
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,499
So I stage my refrigerator,

157
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,794
a lot of you may do it
and not know what it means.

158
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,173
It means you have company coming,
you put better items in. You always act like, "What?"
Put like six glass waters.

159
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,596
"That's just how I live.
Is it different than most people?"

160
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:43,893
"I thought everyone had six glasses
of water lined up to the right."

161
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,937
"They don't do that? Shut up! No..."

162
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,191
"The lemonade with the corkscrew,
is that different?"

163
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,318
"Are there other types or something?"

164
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,614
I didn't contemplate that at Whole Foods
for three hours cos it was 40 cents more.

165
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,368
I go so far out of my way
to stage my refrigerator.

166
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,620
People come, mention it, I act...

167
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,791
It's embarrassing to talk about.
I really do it. I'm not stopping.

168
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,710
People go,
"Oh, milk in a glass container!"

169
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:14,298
I go, "I was in a hurry, grabbing stuff,
putting it in. I didn't notice."

170
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:18,010
Meanwhile, I've been refilling it
with cheaper milk for years.

171
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,432
I just ad lib this stuff,
I'm not worried about it.

172
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:28,813
No, that has nothing to do with that.
That's band cues. I don't give a shit.

173
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,817
Are you mad I don't give a shit?
Can you tell? Seriously.

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,071
If I gave a shit, would I sit...
Would I be here like this?

175
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,244
If you were walking down the street
and saw a guy leaning against the wall,

176
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:49,375
be honest, if he was like this...
You'd think he didn't give a shit.

177
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,004
I wanna be like them, not give a shit.

178
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:59,885
I'll sniff. Catch shit. "Throw me stuff."
I'll catch it and talk about other stuff.

179
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,096
"Throw me those keys.
We going to the mall?"

180
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,349
"Oh my God! He caught that,
he's already talking here".

181
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,976
It'd be about catching it, you know?

182
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,439
How about guys who get into
a take it easy fight? That's sad.

183
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,441
Ever see two guys get in one?

184
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,026
"Take it easy."
"I am. You take it easy!"

185
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:21,365
You know what this is, don't you?
They aren't in touch with their emotions.

186
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,368
Neither wants the other to know
he's got the best of him.

187
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,497
They act like they're taking it easy,
anyone watching from two feet away,

188
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,167
"I don't think either one's
taking it easy!"

189
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,545
"Take it easy." "I'm taking it easy!
You fucking take it easy!"

190
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,380
"You take it easy!"

191
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,551
One guy probably gets his wife.
"Tell him I'm taking it easy."

192
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:45,598
"He is. He doesn't want to argue.
You should see him upset."

193
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,727
Why would I lie?

194
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,645
People say that too. "Why would I lie?"

195
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,733
To get out of something!
What, did you hope I was an idiot?

196
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,071
That's like when a detective,
you see real interrogation footage,

197
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,617
they go, "Why would I murder my family?
It's my family!"

198
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,620
Are they hoping
to get the world's dumbest detective?

199
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:12,333
"Yeah, why would you? Get out of here!
I didn't think of that."

200
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,504
Later, he's talking
to the other detectives.

201
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,214
They're like, "What happened to that guy?"

202
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,674
"He made a good point.
Why would you murder your family?"

203
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,803
"People do!"
"Shit, I didn't think of that. Get him."

204
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:28,390
"He's probably by the kerb area."
Do something.

205
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,352
Nah, it's too late.

206
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,939
I hit a food truck recently. True story.

207
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,899
I hit a food truck and uh...

208
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,612
I don't think there should be food trucks.

209
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,948
I hit the food truck
and broke the guy's bumper.

210
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:47,785
I understand having to pay for it,
my insurance company says...

211
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,954
I gotta get him a deep fryer, too?

212
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,414
That doesn't make sense!
What are you gonna do?

213
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,417
Sure, I understand
it's my fault I hit the truck.

214
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,046
If I gotta get him a tail light, I will.
But a pizza oven?

215
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:02,842
Sure, I understand it's my fault
if I hit him.

216
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,053
But I gotta get him tacos?
That doesn't make sense!

217
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:10,349
Sure, I hit the guy's car,
I want to take responsibility for it,

218
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,351
but I gotta get a five speed blender?

219
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,938
Yes, it's my fault,  but I gotta
get him a pasta maker...

220
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,483
Put a button on it, goddammit!

221
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,987
Is that public domain?

222
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,280
Thank you.

223
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,950
You never know with these guys.
 They think I'm rich.

224
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:37,001
Talking to me before the show...
"Make sure your songs are public domain!"

225
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:42,381
Great. I'll sing, "This old man

Hello, everybody. I'm Johnny Cash.

244
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,272
QVC, it's better than you think!

245
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,944
You have to genuinely
start watching QVC.

246
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,863
Not just passing it by,
saying, "I get it. They make..."

247
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,199
It's sad! It is truly sad.

248
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,577
There's no way
the people who call in are real.

249
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:57,331
They're like, "I love your show."
What show

250
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,627
Why am I mad they think it's a show?
Cos I don't think they're real.

251
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,714
I think they're producers.
Nobody is calling in, "I love your show."

252
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,634
I'd like to meet one of those people.

253
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,803
"What's your favorite episode?"

254
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,431
"I love the one where they talk
about the vacuum for an hour." Oh...

255
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:18,477
"Oh, you have problems.
What's your other favorite shows?"

256
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,814
"I like the mall."
"Oh, you think stores are shows? OK!

257
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,316
"I understand."
It's more sad than anything.

258
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:29,321
They go, "Oh, you can get these pants
on FlexPay."

259
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,073
I promise you this is true.

260
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,411
It sounds too sad, pants on FlexPay.
I understand a vacuum. But sweatpants?

261
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,664
They go, "8.88 a month."

262
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,959
They act like it's you only have to pay
that one bill.

263
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:45,754
Cos you got your pants on FlexPay,
every month you get your bill,

264
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,673
"OK... Got my 8.88!"

265
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,509
The rest of my paycheck
I'll go have fun with.

266
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,303
If you're putting pants on FlexPay,

267
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,098
you've already been at the end
of your financial rope.

268
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,809
You've already put shit on a credit card.

269
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,938
No one starts with pants
and works up to a house and boats.

270
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,526
<i>House Hunters</i> is hard for me
to complain about,

271
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,111
but let me explain something.

272
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,487
<i>House Hunters...</i>

273
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,951
Technically... It's hard to complain
about something you don't have to do.

274
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:20,456
So why don't you just not watch it
and not do this bit? All right.

275
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,333
I think I have a loophole.

276
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,297
I think they suck you in
at the 27-minute mark

277
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,466
where they show you the house.

278
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,051
They go in, then go:

279
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:35,596
"We've been here two weeks, or a month",
then show what they did.

280
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,016
I'm already looking around them
when they're talking

281
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,018
I'm like, "Oh, what did they fuck up?"

282
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,313
Trying to see if they fucked the kitchen.
You know.

283
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,858
They got cheap appliances, great.
That's all I waited for.

284
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,237
Then once in a while, they go,
"You did a good job, what I would do."

285
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:54,239
Mostly, they mess it up.

286
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,910
"Oh, we've been here a month.
We added popcorn ceilings."

287
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:02,331
I'm like, "Oh... I thought you wanted
to get rid of that."

288
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,627
There's always a guy walking around
looking where to put his TV.

289
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,923
I don't know why it bothers me.
I'm gonna guess, and I have,

290
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:14,802
it's like, "Can I put my TV there,
or should I put it there?"

291
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,303
The guy's a fucking idiot.

292
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,681
Then I thought,
"You shouldn't call people idiots."

293
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,309
What do you call a guy
buying the biggest purchase

294
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,646
based on where to put his TV?
Idiot, right?

295
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,566
It's more about this relationship,

296
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,986
he's worried where he's going
to put his TV, and then..

297
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,115
he wants to know where
he can have his man cave.

298
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,034
Why does man cave rub me the wrong way?

299
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,662
I have friends that are happily married.

300
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,165
Some of them need to get away
from their wives, or vice-versa. Significant others getting away
from significant others.

301
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,838
I'm not talking about that...

302
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,132
But none of my friends
are happily married.

303
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:58,178
None will go, "If only I had a room
she couldn't come in! Hehehehe!"

304
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,639
Are you sure you're OK

305
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:04,143
"I need a man cave!
To get away from that!"

306
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,397
To get away from that
You're married!

307
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,648
"I need a man cave!"

308
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,609
I'm thinking of giving this bit
to Brian Regan.

309
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:17,781
I need a man cave! Need to get away
from the thing I married!

310
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,368
I wanna get a man cave
to cave sit in the woods.

311
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:24,955
I need to get away,
I need a cave and a room to hide in

312
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,624
from my significant other
that I chose to be with!

313
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,252
Build me a room,
I'll never let her in, ever!

314
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,845
Wow! That's fun to do. Um...

315
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,390
The other person,
they're sexist on the show,

316
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:47,436
they show the guy with the man cave,
the woman wants a walk-in closet.

317
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,690
On that show, it's always,
"Does it have a walk"

318
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,942
I'm not exaggerating.
It's sad, sometimes.

319
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,071
It's like,
"I have... I have so many things!"

320
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,908
They'll show them a house
with a small walk-in,

321
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,328
they feel it's necessary,
knowing there's a camera crew,

322
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:07,497
to go, "That's not even enough
for my things!

323
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,335
"I got a lot of things,
I don't think you understand!"

324
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,882
"All I need is a walk-in closet.
I could put my favorite chair in it."

325
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,385
You need a walk-in closet,
you need a man cave,

326
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,971
why not get couple's counseling
and enjoy your living room?

327
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,390
But that's more of a TED Talk...

328
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,729
They want their granite countertops
so bad!

329
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,982
Oh, do they.
"Does it have granite countertops?"

330
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,902
"Our friends from Irvine have them,
we need them!"

331
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,488
I... Just relax, it's not that important.

332
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,367
"Does it have stainless steel?"
You know? Stop it, already.

333
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
You know, Timothy...

334
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,745
I have an idea...

335
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,125
Hopefully, you can do something illegal
and get put in prison,

336
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,254
have all the stainless steel you want.
These are just ideas.

337
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,422
Then, when you're in prison,

338
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,633
maybe you'll get killed,

339
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,970
then you'll get granite countertops
with your name on!

340
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,055
No. Let's not...

341
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:09,726
There are certain things,
nah, that's OK... Didn't I tell ya?

342
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,186
A dear friend, Rory Scovel...

343
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,063
Fuck Rory Scovel!

344
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,399
Fuck Rory Scovel!

345
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,901
Fuck Rory Scovel!

346
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,362
Fuck Rory Scovel!

347
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,031
Fuck Rory Scovel!

348
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,409
-Fuck...
-Rory Scovel is my friend!

349
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,327
Fuck Rory Scovel!

350
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,705
-Fuck Rory Scovel!

351
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,790
Fuck Rory Scovel!

352
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,167
-Rory Scovel is my friend!
-Fuck Rory Scovel!

353
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,628
-Fuck Rory Scovel!
-All right.

354
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,714
Fuck Rory Scovel! -Fuck Rory Scovel!
-Yeah.

355
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,843
Fuck Rory Scovel...

356
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,845
Does it work on you guys, too?

357
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:50,642
Ever have something bother you
and you don't know why?

358
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,730
Sometimes things bother you
and you know why. Sometimes you wonder.

359
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,983
It doesn't bother anyone else,
but I'll say it.

360
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,612
If there's one person here, I can tell,
who it bothers, I'll be happy.

361
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,658
I don't like when people walk backwards
on the treadmill. I just...

362
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,537
All right, you're great.
Oh, what muscle are you working? Please.

363
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,207
It's like when people overstretch.
Not all people overstretch.

364
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,626
Sometimes at the gym
I see somebody stretching.

365
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,087
It's healthy to stretch,
that person gets it.

366
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,257
Other times, I go,
"Shut the fuck up with your stretching!"

367
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:27,304
Shut the fuck up with what you're doing,
that's all.

368
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,348
Other than that, who cares?

369
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,184
This bothers me,
if it doesn't bother you, I understand,

370
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,896
if your partner comes out
of the bathroom flossing,

371
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,107
walking around the bedroom
and neither of you mind, that's OK,

372
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,819
but if someone corrects you,
asks you not to,

373
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,780
don't make them the crazy person.

374
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,239
You're walking out...

375
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,868
I had my sister-in-law and my brother
staying in my guest room...

376
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:55,332
-Oh! I have a guest room! Wow!
-That's not even a brag.

377
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,167
I'm so wealthy!

378
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,419
-I'm not saying I'm wealthy.
-I have a room

379
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,756
I don't even use, I just have guests, wow!

380
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,260
Oh, I already have enough rooms,
but I guess I could use a couple more.

381
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,346
I am so Todd Glass! This is my...

382
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,016
She comes out of the bedroom flossing,
she's like, "How are you?"

383
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:19,731
Food particles are flying all over,
I said, "Please, don't do that."

384
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,900
She goes,  "They're just teeny pieces."

385
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:26,071
Most expect me to say,
"No, they're gigantic."

386
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,033
No, they're smaller than teeny,
probably closer to microscopic,

387
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:34,246
but if someone came over your house,
this is to everyone flossing,

388
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:40,252
you can floss all you want,
but you can't wiggle out of what I say.

389
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,839
You have to go, "Fuck, that's true",
and just soak it in.

390
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:44,881
Here's the deal,

391
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:49,094
if you floss walking around your house
and this happened, you'd have no defense.

392
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,639
Say someone came with a bucket
of the things they'd saved for ten years,

393
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:56,560
every time they floss
they put it in a bucket,

394
00:23:56,643 --> 00:24:00,689
they come to your house,
take a handful with a plastic glove,

395
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,777
you're "ewwing" at the thought,
I wanted to wear a glove to calm you,

396
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,196
and they take that plastic glove

397
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,282
and start throwing stuff
all over your bedroom.

398
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:15,162
Your only defence is, if you floss,
going, "No, we do that slowly."

399
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,664
That's all you got. I hope you're happy.

400
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,417
Thank you.

401
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,587
I swear to God, to the truth,

402
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,048
I told her, "If ever a joke doesn't hit
give me a triangle."

403
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,217
I thought that did all right!

404
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:34,139
Apparently she goes, "I think
this is a time he needs my help."

405
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,518
Pigeons can get on my nerves.

406
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,687
I like to get mad about pigeons.

407
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:46,234
Here's the deal with pigeons. Sometimes
I think they're passive aggressive.

408
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,987
I think they could be a bit.
You ever... OK.

409
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,325
You know when the light turns green,
there's pigeons, I see it in the city,

410
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:57,704
and the pigeons run out of the way
at the last second,

411
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:02,125
they're like this
then they literally start hustling.

412
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,504
And they're eating stuff out of the road,
I'm not making fun of pigeons.

413
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,923
Last night, this is true,
why would I make it up?

414
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:11,885
Right where you're sitting,
were two pigeons.

415
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,971
Two pigeons sitting right there,
I started my pigeon material

416
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,725
and go, "I don't care
about making fun of pigeons,

417
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,895
but are they pigeon jokes
pigeons could laugh at?"

418
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:26,274
That's OK. You can make fun of people,
but not group make fun.

419
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,611
If you leave this room tonight
and tell your friends,

420
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:32,614
"He said he had pigeons in the first row,
there weren't pigeons."

421
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,451
They'll go, "How does that benefit him?"
You're gonna look stupid.

422
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:41,122
You'll go, "I guess he could benefit.
Why would he make it up?"

423
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,875
I started my pigeon jokes, I looked down,

424
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,046
they were like, "It's so true!"
Nothing makes me happier than that.

425
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,758
But sometimes...

426
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:56,471
they eat stuff on the road, why
do they have to wait til the last minute?

427
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,976
There's not London broil in there,
they're eating sand! You know?

428
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:04,354
They run out of the way,
I think they're passive aggressive,

429
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:07,816
acting like they're trying their hardest,
"If only I could fly..."

430
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,653
Wait, you can fly!
Jump and stay jumped, all right?

431
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,447
They're like, "Haha, suck my pigeon dick!"
Whoa!

432
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:18,285
"Suck my pigeon dick,"
a good name for my special.

433
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,873
There are things
that literally I've thought about for...

434
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,252
I'm likely sanding years off,
ten years ago

435
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:30,880
I saw a woman eat a KitKat so slow
I haven't stopped talking about it.

436
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,300
I wanna figure it out, I wanna go,

437
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:37,387
"Was I getting upset with nothing
or was she doing something?"

438
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,973
Cos I'm very open to go,

439
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,351
"That has nothing to do with her
and everything to do with you."

440
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,147
She was eating it like,  "Oh, I'm so...
just eating... No. What?"

441
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,610
You know! You eat it  like that
when nobody's around

442
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,863
It's eleven o'clock at night,
you crave a KitKat, nobody's looking,

443
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,823
you eat it and put it down?

444
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,035
Then she was reading her book
going back and forth,

445
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:05,540
I'm like, "You're full of shit!
Is that book as good as a KitKat?"

446
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,334
No, I'm not aggressive.

447
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,587
I just want to know if that book
is as good as that KitKat.

448
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,217
Is it chocolaty and crunchy?  I'm not
trying to be rude. That's all I'm asking.

449
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,304
Then she puts her KitKat
on the tray table, honestly,

450
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,848
reads the book for six minutes,
I'm like, "No!

451
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:26,686
You don't stop fucking
to have soup." That's a good analogy.

452
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,439
It is, cos it makes you get past it.

453
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:33,526
"Oh, no, you haven't had my soup.
Let's fuck, have some soup."

454
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,111
I'm sure the fucking's better!

455
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,490
I have a confession to make.

456
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:42,702
Sometimes when I'm on stage,
I'll talk about how cute dogs are.

457
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,665
When I see the audience doesn't match
my intensity, I started pulling back.

458
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,377
I'm like, "They're so cute.
You want to mush their little faces."

459
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,003
People are with me.

460
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,173
I wanna bite them. I wanna bite them.

461
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:58,218
Like not to, you know,
but you get a little, right?

462
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:01,346
I mean bite. Like, I'll turn
their little lip up and suck it.

463
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,557
They're so good, and once
they're next to you like...

464
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,477
You're like,
"Oh, you're letting me do this.

465
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,439
Let me really get this. What's
under your lips? It's all goodness.

466
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:15,193
Let me see your ear,
let me suck on that ear.

467
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,696
Everything about you's fucking...

468
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,366
You're non-judgemental, kind, decent,
I wanna suck it out of you.

469
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,077
I want some of that in me." You know?

470
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,080
Everyone has a voice for their dog.
You just do it naturally.

471
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,916
I watched a dog named Ursula,
she was a bulldog.

472
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:34,170
When I was eating,
she had a voice, she'd casually do it,

473
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:39,175
she'd go, "Oh, my God," if she could talk,
don't think I'm losing my mind,

474
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,220
"Oh, my God, I love chicken!
I'm not even just saying it."

475
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:47,058
You know, like, other dogs are like,
"Whatever you have, I really like it."

476
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,438
I'd go, "Ursula, it's pizza."
"I love pizza. Is it from that place?"

477
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:56,067
So cute. I used to come home
when I first watched her,

478
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,945
I did it for seven months,
my friends were out of town.

479
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:04,284
At first, when I came home, she didn't
look like she cared about me. She'd be...

480
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:07,537
I'd walk by, I'd be like, "Hey, Ursula."

481
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,498
My mom told me,
"Treat her like a Golden Retriever.

482
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,585
Her grumpy face
doesn't match her heart."

483
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,295
I thought about that.

484
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,965
I walk in one day, I swear this is true,
I go, "Ursula!"

485
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:21,760
She's like, "Oh, my God!"
She started flipping out.

486
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:23,094
I said, "I love you."

487
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:26,181
She started running around like crazy.

488
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,477
I'm like, "She thought I didn't like her.
I thought she didn't like me."

489
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,481
Then I figured out
she laughs at aggression.

490
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,483
I can yell at her and she loves it.

491
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,151
But I yell at her nice things.

492
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,446
I'll be like, "No, Urusla..."
I'll do this with nobody around. "No, it's not my fault you're so cute.
I have to bite you!"

493
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,117
She's like...

494
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:49,245
"Are you wearing new perfume?
It's driving me fucking nuts!"

495
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,247
That doesn't scare her.

496
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,126
When people say, "Dogs don't
understand verbiage, only tone."

497
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,378
Tell them to get the fuck away.

498
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,840
You know those people,
they don't think we understand

499
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:04,427
that there are boundaries
in human and dog relationships.

500
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,348
They're so worried about it
that they think, they think...

501
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:13,061
They have to go, "The only reason
your dog licks you is for the salt."

502
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,979
I have to do their voice like that,

503
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:18,107
I don't know how else
someone would come to that conclusion.

504
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,568
It seems like you're nervous
for shit to talk about.

505
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,696
You've told a lot of people, not just me.

506
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,867
I wanna know
why you're telling everyone that.

507
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:31,329
"The only reason your dog licks you
is the salt."

508
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:35,041
Great. I'll go home and hit my dog,
"What am I, a salt lick? You fuck!

509
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:37,418
"I thought you wanted to fuck me!"

510
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,256
Everyone has a voice for their dog,
I take her to the park,

511
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,883
a guy comes over, being nice,

512
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:49,180
"I know what you're thinking,
'What's everybody patting me for?'"

513
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:53,226
I go, "Sir, that's not my dog's voice.
I have one, it's not..."

514
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,027
He's here tonight.

515
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,699
Some people say "I hate cats."
First of all relax.

516
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,618
"I hate cats." Really?

517
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,620
Really

518
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,707
Isn't the truth you saw a cat you loved,

519
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,501
a big fat tabby cat come out
of someone's bedroom

520
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,629
you went, "Pst", it walked away,
"Fuck I hate cats."

521
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,257
No, cats hate you. Come on!

522
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,593
No, come on. I got you good.

523
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,430
Well...

524
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,891

OK, I think I'm good.

551
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,844
You gotta chug it out.
Let's talk about Sea World...

552
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,307
They're deciding to do away
with torturing animals.

553
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,310
I can't believe
they got away with it this long.

554
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,731
They always interrupt the news,
"A killer whale has killed a trainer."

555
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:07,819
It's sad when a human loses their life,
but unpredictable?

556
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,989
They interrupt the news
like this is unpredictable.

557
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,826
We tend to give unpredictable events
the most empathy.

558
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:16,828
They couldn't have prevented it.

559
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,707
Ever had a friend who complains
and you think, "He brings it on himself."

560
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,002
Imagine that friend doing this
in your house,

561
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,086
picture it!

562
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,257
Your friend goes,
"You'll never believe what happened,

563
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,300
and it's not like when I did drugs.

564
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:35,346
Something happened.
Nobody could've seen this coming.

565
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,515
Just listen, OK?

566
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:41,019
I... This is gonna take a turn,
it's gonna freak you out.

567
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:45,314
I got a killer whale out of the ocean
with a crane. Just listen...

568
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,108
It takes a freaky turn.

569
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,361
Whatever you're guessing,
get it out of your head.

570
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,905
So we put it in a baby pool
in my backyard.

571
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,951
"It's scared shitless
cos it doesn't have its sonar.

572
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,496
"A friend of mine sits on it
and tries to teach it tricks.

573
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,582
You won't believe what happened."

574
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,962
"Did it kill him out of fear?"
"Shut up! How did you guess?"

575
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,381
The guys that stupid, he can't believe.

576
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,885
"There's no way I could've predicted that!
That's crazy!"

577
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,762
Can I tell you something else?

578
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,638
I want you to go home,

579
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,685
take your fish tanks
and empty them into the street!

580
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:28,024
That's right, ladies and gentlemen,
when I came to LA in the early 90s,

581
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:30,276
there were fish running all
over the place!

582
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,487
Come on, it's not a joke.

583
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,780
And another thing...

584
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,824
the big fanfare gets a bit much,
people criticize.

585
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,536
But I will tell you,
give me a little more,

586
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,914
let's talk about declawing cats...

587
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,880
People in the audience have cats,
I'm gonna talk about declawing cats.

588
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:53,633
There might be people
who have declawed cats

589
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,052
like, "Will I enjoy this bit?"

590
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,762
If you have a declawed cat,

591
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,849
it's OK, you already declawed it,
how can you realize I made a point

592
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:07,021
if I don't let you out of the guilt
of having done it. People are, "It's me."

593
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:11,192
If your cat's declawed, your pool
above ground, I doubt you like my show..

594
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,947
If your cat is,
go home if you want to relieve yourself,

595
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,868
but go home and tape knives to its feet,
let it scrape up some of the furniture.

596
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,914
But if declawing your cats makes sense,

597
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,750
the role play coming up
shouldn't seem silly.

598
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,754
Imagine someone, "You talk
about loving cats but don't have one."

599
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,841
"They scrape up furniture,
I couldn't get one."

600
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,719
They go, "No... You don't just not get it,

601
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,638
you adapt it to you.

602
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:43,724
Bring it to the vet,
they pull it out with pliers.

603
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,020
A well thought-out person doesn't
think 'I won't get one.'

604
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,691
My daughter wanted a giraffe,
I had to have its feet cut off!

605
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:55,278
My son wanted a lion,
I had its teeth sanded down."

606
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:56,946
Bring it home, guys!

607
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,202
Now, let's talk organized religion.

608
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,080
There is no Better Business Bureau,
can we agree?

609
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,208
If there was,
wouldn't they have stopped that?

610
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,127
Even if they did almost nothing.

611
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,255
"They'd stop organized religion,
it's an atrocity."

612
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:19,093
No, seriously, I'm not talking
about your belief in God, relax.

613
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,720
So many are going, "Whoa."

614
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,514
If you believe in God,
you go directly to God,

615
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,392
"Organized religion's done a lot
of damage," I do.

616
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,562
I'm talking about organized religion,
if...

617
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:33,524
If Nike said, "If you don't
buy our product, you'll rot in Hell,"

618
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,945
the Better Business Bureau would say
"You can't say that."

619
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,448
"But we believe it."
"You can't say it."

620
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,910
Some people worry
about their eternal life.

621
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,914
I think it might be how kind you are
while here. That might be it.

622
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,959
That's why you wanna make sure you aren't
giving a group of people a hard time

623
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,004
you should be making breathe easier.

624
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,840
There's natural disasters,
we all know that,

625
00:36:57,924 --> 00:37:00,509
there's earthquakes, there's floods,

626
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:03,221
that's what's supposed
to destruct against our will,

627
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,640
people are only here to be nice.

628
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,809
If you use your energy
to make a group feel less,

629
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,562
you're another natural disaster.

630
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,565
Who cares? I don't want to be preachy.
Let's have fun.

631
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,444
Are you having a good time, everybody?
I don't wanna...

632
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,949
That's not what I'm here to talk about!

633
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,201
I enjoy smoking, it works for me.

634
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:29,413
I don't smoke during the day,
I'm not a daytime pot smoker,

635
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,540
cos I'm not productive.

636
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,835
Once I did, or twice in my whole life,
I smoked during the day.

637
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:39,048
All I did was call all my friends and go,
"Oh, my God, I'm so high!"

638
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,218
I wanted them to say how high they were.

639
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,179
I don't want to hang with people like,

640
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,974
"I drive good high,"
you don't get high good!

641
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:52,395
It makes no sense. "I get high,
follow the rules of the road. It's fun.

642
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,107
There's nothing like getting high
and merging."

643
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,694
Sure, maybe I'll do some heroin
and do my taxes!

644
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,154
I know how to enjoy life, I really do!

645
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:06,367
But, uh, you know, I was on a plane,
a woman offered me a Reese's cup.

646
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,037
I said, I'd smoked pot
a few times on a plane, won't again.

647
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,332
It wasn't the worst thing ever,
but I just said stuff.

648
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,668
She goes, "Want a Reese's cup?"

649
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,295
I said, "I'd like both."

650
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,796
Then I go,

651
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:22,842
because... And I understand
what I meant,

652
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,095
I don't enjoy one Reese's cup,
just one and nothing.

653
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,806
If I have a bowl of them,
I enjoy every one,

654
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,851
cos there's seven more, ten more,
preferably more.

655
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,145
When I get to the last one, I'm like,

656
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,897
"May as well throw it out,
I won't enjoy it."

657
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:38,441
So, that's all I wanted.

658
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,736
I'll say things my friends will figure out
right away.

659
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,655
I'll say one thing,
all heads will turn in the car.

660
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,783
Once I was driving
through a shitty neighborhood,

661
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:52,121
I saw a bird and said, "Why would a bird
live in a shitty neighborhood?"

662
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,000
He's like, "Are you high?"
I'm like, "How did you know?"

663
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,378
I thought it was so perceptive
that a good friend was able to...

664
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,839
I go, "Seriously, how did you know?"

665
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,634
"You asked why a bird would live
in a shitty neighborhood..." "Oh, yeah!"

666
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:11,349
"How come there's extra large
and extra small, but no extra medium?"

667
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,892
"That's a good thought!"

668
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,063
Hey, ladies and gentlemen,

669
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:21,275
is there any bit I haven't done
and now's a good time? Yell it out.

670
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,277
Do the bit about when you were little.

671
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,946
All right, there we go. Um...

672
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,741
-Richard.

673
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,493
OK, cool. There you go.

674
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,871
When I was little,
my head was the same size

675
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,249
and every picture of me,
my parents are making an album,

676
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:41,003
they send me pictures,
every one is me like this...

677
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,465
Now, I'm 11 or 12, even eight,
every picture's like this.

678
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,596
Because I was always asking questions,

679
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:53,933
like, "Why don't we have
a circle driveway?"

680
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:59,355
No kid should want a circle driveway,
we'll talk about that, I did want one.

681
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,192
I asked my parents, "Mom,
why don't we have a circle driveway?"

682
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,486
I was in Fifth Grade!

683
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,532
The Nalibotskis had a nice circle drive,
I'd stare at it like this.

684
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,367
I wanted it so bad.

685
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,413
Those people years later,
this is true, I promise, came to my show,

686
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,873
they came over,
"You probably don't remember,"

687
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:22,378
Which I didn't,  when they said
I remembered I loved circle driveways.

688
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:26,424
They go, "We had a circle driveway,
an important part of the story."

689
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,844
I go, "I don't know what I did,
but I badly wanted one."

690
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,098
"We don't know how old you were,
you walked to school staring at it."

691
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,558
I was!

692
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,727
They tell me I was staring at their drive
like this.

693
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:43,232
They came out and said something
like "Can we help you"

694
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,817
I go, "How much is that?"

695
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,238
I wanted to go home and tell my parents.
"Look,  this is like 100 bucks."

696
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,992
I swear I remember asking my parents
why we didn't have one,

697
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,494
she goes, " We didn't want one." Shut up!

698
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:59,540
The builder asks if you want a free one,
"Nah, we don't like it.

699
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,418
"We like a regular driveway,
what do we give a shit"

700
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,546
When I was little, I'd look
at adults and go,

701
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,593
"I want to be them. I could do that."
I had no idea what I'd do for a living.

702
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:14,180
My parents were so worried
I wouldn't find anything to do,

703
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,599
I wasn't retaining anything in school.

704
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,895
Because of that, whatever I did
they'd go, "You could be a dog walker."

705
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,355
I'm like, "I'm gonna be all right" Um...

706
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,900
I'd go to the car wash,

707
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,653
I saw the owner walking around
and go, "I could do that, look at him.

708
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:34,033
Walking around telling people what to do.
Looks fun! 'Customers waiting!'

709
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,203
I think I'd really get into that."

710
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,205
Once, my dad's car came through,

711
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:43,584
and he goes, "Kevin, run that guy's car
through again, it's filthy."

712
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,419
My dad goes, "That's OK."

713
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,129
He goes, "No, no, no."

714
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:52,218
Then me and my brothers did a bit all day
as the guy not taking no for an answer.

715
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:55,721
Even at that age we did bits.
The bit was, "No, it's OK."

716
00:41:55,804 --> 00:42:00,518
He'd go, "No! You got a shitty Impala,
this is probably your only good day.

717
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,312
Let me fucking wash it.
My name's out there!

718
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:07,566
Sure you don't care, look at you!
Your wife's probably not attractive.

719
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,153
Let me run it through again."
My dad would be, "OK, whatever."

720
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:16,200
There was a restaurant owner,
I thought for sure I could be him.

721
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,995
He'd walk around, he knew everybody.
I was impressed with that.

722
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,458
Ever been to a place where they do that?
"How you doing? Good to see you."

723
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,669
"I could do that." "Hey, you good?"

724
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:29,838
He didn't know much about everybody,
he'd walk fast.

725
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,758
"Good to see you.
Mom's OK Haha!"

726
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,886
They're like, "I don't know."
He goes, "Gotta run!"

727
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,848
"I don't... Maybe I mentioned a car
to this guy...

728
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,268
Maybe he has a better memory than me."

729
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:44,603
He'd always say hello to people.

730
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:49,275
One time, I was maybe 13,
but I remember this, so does my brother,

731
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,195
the owner of the restaurant got
the guy's name completely wrong.

732
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:57,032
He's like, "Hey, Bill."
The guy goes, "Actually, my name is..."

733
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,245
And he got out of it. Watch.
This guy did it. This is real, he did it.

734
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,164
When I do it,
you'll be like, "That works."

735
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,749
What's your name, sir?

736
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,836
Kale, that's a great name.
You should change yours to Kale.

737
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:14,466
I'll say, "How you doing, Bob?"
You'll say, "Actually, it's Kale." OK?

738
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,970
I'll walk through, "How ya doing, Bobby?"
"It's Kale."

739
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:21,265
Give me chance to say my line first,
then "It's Kale."

740
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,058
People fuck it up a lot.

741
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,396
-My name's Kale.

742
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:31,150
That's all right. Have fun.
Good to see ya. You good?

743
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,319
You good?

744
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:38,282
The guy was like, "Aw, I will have fun!"

745
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,286
How the hell did he just do that?
"Have fun." Put it on him.

746
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,746
"Don't worry about it."

747
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,793
Sometimes when you do stand up
you exaggerate the truth,

748
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,962
but I'm being genuine with you.

749
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,673
About five years ago,
I had a heart attack.

750
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,885
-Oh, I had a heart attack!
-That's not even bragging.

751
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,346
-Wow! Look at me.
-That's not bragging.

752
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,682
-My arteries got clogged.

753
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,476
I got thrown in an ambulance!

754
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,562
I honestly had a heart attack
about five years ago.

755
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,439
I'm fine now, don't be upset.

756
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:14,151
It was after a show,
Sarah Silverman &amp; Friends had a show,

757
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,944
After...

758
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,448
You'd do the show,
Sarah'd like to smoke pot.

759
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,743
She'd put a friend on as a headliner,
me, of course...

760
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,997
After the show, I didn't feel well,
I didn't know what it was.

761
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,876
I thought I'd run
around the audience too much doing bits.

762
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:34,296
I got off stage feeling ill,
thought it would pass.

763
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,716
I thought I'd smoked too much.
I'm a one-pot hit.

764
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,719
Doug Benson was there,
lot of other comedians.

765
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:44,890
They had three joints going,
it hit me five times, I was like, "Eh."

766
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:47,976
Finally, I said,
"I think I'm too high to go on."

767
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,062
Doug goes, "What was that like?"

768
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,857
You're like it all the time.
It's too high for me, not you.

769
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,486
He didn't understand,
he thought he'd never been too high.

770
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:00,280
I can't handle it. I need to pace myself.

771
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:04,576
I can't be high where I float in the air.
I wish I could let myself go.

772
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,205
No matter how much pot I've ever smoked,
how much mushrooms I've done,

773
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:12,334
I've only tried those drugs,
I still can't stop cleaning.

774
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:15,629
I don't know what it would take.
I'm gonna try heroin. No, if I did heroin,
I'd still dry the sink out.

775
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,301
I'd be, you know... Have a...

776
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,930
I'd be fainting on the floor
like "Must dry sink" on heroin.

777
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,894
Finally, an ambulance comes,
and I don't want to get in the ambulance.

778
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:33,397
The paramedic's pretty smart, he goes,

779
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,567
"Why don't we just put you in
and save you a trip to the ER."

780
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,402
It worked. Got in.

781
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,112
Two minutes later, he goes,

782
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,407
"I don't want to alarm you,
but you're having a heart attack."

783
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,785
Firstly, that's alarming,
what else will they say or do?

784
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,706
"No, that's cool."
I'd blow a bubble or something,

785
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,249
Um...

786
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,501
As they go to shut the doors,

787
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,963
I have one of those moments,
I don't have them often,

788
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:01,216
but you get a moment where you look
at yourself like,

789
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,345
"Really, is this how I want
to continue this lie?"

790
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:10,350
Cos as they're shutting the doors,
I yell to Sarah, "Call my girlfriend!"

791
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,144
Uh-eh... Uh-eh...

792
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:14,313
Very, you know... Uh-eh...

793
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:17,024
Call my girlfriend. Like...

794
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,777
Later I asked if she knew what I meant
she said yeah.

795
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:23,197
I think from how you said it,
"Girlfriend", everyone knew.

796
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,909
You were like, "Girlfriend, right, Sarah?

797
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,036
My girlfriend!"

798
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,414
What was I afraid of? People going,

799
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,417
"He's having a heart attack.
I think he like dudes."

800
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,340
So, I will tell you this,
I don't talk about it that much

801
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,718
cos some of the verbiage is hard for me
to maneuver,

802
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,763
I'm not crazy about the phrase,
"Coming out of the closet",

803
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,474
it seems a bit flamboyant for me.

804
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,602
Maybe,"Busting out of the shed"
would work a little better.

805
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,688
I'd feel cooler. Like...

806
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,775
But the um...

807
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,736
uh...  thing where
my friends figured it out

808
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,906
was, first of all, I talked
about a guy I was with,

809
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,826
I'd always said girl,
never messed up on stage.

810
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,496
Nobody thought it was weird,
it shows relationships are relationships.

811
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:16,959
It's not up for debate. That seems cocky.
It's all the same. Proof of it.

812
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,127
I did a 15-year experiment

813
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,839
talking  out a guy on stage
saying it was a girl.

814
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,966
Nobody went, "It doesn't sound like..."

815
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:28,929
All the couples, all sexes, were like,
"It's just like us! Haha!"

816
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,806
Well, I got news, fuckface!

817
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,895
For 15 years, seriously, "That's like us!
That is just like us!"

818
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,523
And that's my point. It's the same, right?

819
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,484
Sorry, I didn't meant to yell. Anyway...

820
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:47,155
Granted, I would've got caught out
if I told some stories, but I never did.

821
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,659
If I was like,
"So, I was talking to my girlfriend,

822
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,036
she was peeing next to me
in the bathroom...

823
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,541
She wanted to go eat..." People are like,
"How does she pee..."

824
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,836
And I think that, um...

825
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,839
Most friends said they figured out later,

826
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:07,718
some knew, some didn't care,
some said it was by my relationship

827
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:10,679
because you could tell...
I always hid behind...

828
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,140
Guys that are buddies
with their friends argue,

829
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,934
sometimes it's a joke,
"You seem like you're dating",

830
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:19,605
and they're just friends,
so I hid behind that.

831
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,523
But people could tell.

832
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,694
I'd go, "No, you said if we did something
you wanted to do last week,

833
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:29,364
we could do something I wanted
this week, you promised!"

834
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:32,659
People are like,
"I think they're more than friends."

835
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,455
"I have a friend,
but we don't care that much."

836
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,833
Well, that, I think, cheapens it, but...

837
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,127
So.. Anyway...

838
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,635
They put me in the ambulance,
bring me to hospital.

839
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:53,555
we're in the E.R., a nurse comes,
"We have really good news,

840
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:57,434
one of our best surgeons just pulled in."
That's not good news.

841
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:02,022
And first of all... Secondly, sorry.
Can you have two first of alls?

842
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:07,903
What are they gonna do? Go.
"A guy just pulled in, bit of a drinker,

843
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:12,199
he's coming, he's fun, keeps it light,
said he operates blacked out."

844
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:17,871
They bring me up to the emergency ward
and out of nowhere pull my pants off.

845
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm like, "What?" I know,
you're on so much medicine,

846
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,753
you'd think I'd go,
"You don't even realize.

847
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,298
You're out of it, you lay naked." No.
I remember going, "Oh, my God,

848
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:32,844
I'm having a heart attack,
they're looking at my dick. It's there.

849
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:37,683
"It's laying there. I can't go like this.
OK, there's my dick.

850
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,977
"There's my dick. There's my dick!'"

851
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,730
I thought to myself,
"These are professional nurses,

852
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,649
they're desensitized to this."

853
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,652
You know what? My paranoia,
it could be a first day nurse,

854
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:52,739
like, "Wow, don't look,
I know it seems like they know."

855
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:57,285
Or guys can look at people's penises,
I'm very open-minded.

856
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:01,039
I shouldn't make the nurse the woman.
It was a guy and a girl.

857
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,749
Both staring at my cock.

858
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,168
My material is politically correct.

859
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:09,339
Can I say one thing about PC?
I'll be quick. Get ready to stop me.

860
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,385
Stop with everyone so PC.
It's just called kind, that's what it is.

861
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,137
Just get over it. Seriously.

862
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,890
Just think if you walk around
like, "Everyone's PC,"

863
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:19,808
It's not PC!

864
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,436
It's just fucking kind.
Put a button on it.

865
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,982
So I want to talk
about my heart attack a bit more.

866
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,694
All I want to do is start hitting my penis
just to make it...

867
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,030
I don't know
if the doctor's unprofessional.

868
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,533
Maybe he's, "He has a small penis.
This guy may have a better life."

869
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,036
Not consciously, maybe unconsciously,

870
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,622
"This guy has a bigger dick,
we'll operate on him, then..."

871
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,332
So I hit it a little bit.

872
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:47,502
Let me tell you,

873
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:51,339
swimmer shrinkage is one thing,
heart attack dick is way worse.

874
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,176
Heart attack dick's like,

875
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:57,137
"Who's the nice young lady
we're operating on?"

876
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:02,768
These are some jokes I didn't get to,
I think we wrote something for it.

877
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:03,852
Here we go, guys.

878
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,022
♪ <i>These are the jokes he didn't get to</i> ♪

879
00:51:07,105 --> 00:51:10,317
♪ <i>These are the jokes he didn't do</i> ♪

880
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,570
♪ <i>These are the jokes he didn't get to</i> ♪

881
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,281
♪ <i>These are the jokes he didn't do</i> ♪

882
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,117
Now, I really wish I had time
to get to these jokes,

883
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,995
but I don't, I'm on a time restraint.

884
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:27,876
This is funny, I'm going to jot it down
and work it into a bit, don't think your laughter means nothing.
I'll do it, just not in this special.

885
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:37,177
I was on a bus, and the driver goes,
"Any doctors on board? A lady's ill."

886
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,973
I said to my friend, "If you're a doctor
on a bus, is that the doctor you want?"

887
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,934
More of a... Know what I mean?

888
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,812
Is there a financial planner
in the Super Show?

889
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:49,397
My wife has a few questions.

890
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,192
This is an idea, what I thought,
so you know,

891
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:55,195
there's something there,
I gotta do something with it, anybody could do something like this.

892
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,367
You know when the TSA pat you down?

893
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:01,868
Just go, "Oh, I came."

894
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,078
I don't know...

895
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,706
I was thinking
about opening up a massage parlor.

896
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,334
This is definitely something
I'll work on.

897
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,420
I was gonna open a massage parlor
with happy beginnings.

898
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,798
Maybe there's something.

899
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,677
If Cookie Monster loves cookies,
why do the cookies fall out?

900
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:22,472
The person eating the cookies
should be the Cookie Monster.

901
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:26,476
Maybe he's a cookie liker. Anyway...
That's probably dated.

902
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,602
And then, uh...

903
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:32,732
This is something I wish I'd talked to,
I like doing this bit,

904
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,944
what if Rodney Dangerfield
did Mitch Hedberg jokes?

905
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,239
"A guy asked me
if I wanted a frozen banana,

906
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,242
I said 'No, I want a regular one later!'"

907
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:47,497
"I used to do drugs, I still do,
but I used to, too. You know?"

908
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,501
"I saw a sign, it said,
 'Escalator broke.'"

909
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:55,255
"Shouldn't it say,
'Escalator temporarily stairs?'"

910
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:59,134
Anyway, I wish I had time for that bit,
but I don't, so...

911
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,927
Todd, we love that bit!

912
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,639
-Well, I don't have time for it.
-It's our favorite bit!

913
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,225
-It's our favorite bit, Todd!
-Come on!

914
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:09,186
It's the only reason we showed up.

915
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,898
I got one thing to say.
the acting isn't so great. Anyway...

916
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:20,488
I do want to know if there is a bit
I didn't do, yell it out, I'll do it.

917
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,620
OK, mumbling Rodney.
Now, mumbling Rodney is just...

918
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,748
Do you know
Roger Dangerfield was the first...

919
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:33,084
Roger Dangerfield was a comedian,
many don't know,

920
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:37,255
because Roger complained,
but didn't make it funny, he'd go,

921
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:41,176
"My son's not too smart,
he's doing bad in school." OK. but...

922
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:44,638
"My wife, I'm in a horrible relationship,
it's hard."

923
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,432
The audience was like,
"We feel bad for you."

924
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:50,310
"My wife's not a good cook,
we don't enjoy it."

925
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,687
He gets it, there's something there.

926
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:57,567
"My daughter's not too bright, it shows
when she talks with bad verbiage."

927
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,362
People'd be like,
"There's something there."

928
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,073
But Rodney figured how to make it funny,

929
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:06,409
"The other day there was this thing
with a penguin...

930
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,870
The other day I was walking around...

931
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:12,749
I tell you my daughter did this thing
with a muffler. You know?

932
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:16,336
I'll tell ya, my son sits
around the house with a shed...

933
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,005
My wife's not too great either with a...

934
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,048
Bada ho...

935
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,091
Huda ha!

936
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,550
Whoa. Hey!

937
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:27,055
Ha! Ho, hey, ho. ha!"
This is a professional show.

938
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,765
Well...

939
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:34,104
Wow, you people are nice!
Seriously nice, not just me saying.

940
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,356
What was that

941
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,191
Who was that?

942
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,827
That's not cos your phone went off.

943
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:54,666
No, no, no. Don't make me a bad guy.
Please don't make me a bad guy.

944
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:59,170
I know it hurts, next time
you'll remember to order prop bottles.

945
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,887
You gotta teach 'em.

946
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:13,184
I saw <i>Whiplash</i>, hit them on the head
with a bottle or they don't learn.

947
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,274
Here's the thing, ever have something
where you think...

948
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:24,654
You've figured out the world's problems?
"That's what it all leads back to."

949
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:26,489
It's all about empathy.

950
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:29,242
I've figured it out.
We could move faster...

951
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,455
I'm being very serious, I'm passionate
about this, talk about it 24/7.

952
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:38,084
People come to my house, I talk about it.
I go, "Why talk about it?" They go,

953
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,671
"No matter what we talk about,
you start talking about it."

954
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,383
"That's like people saying
we should go back to how we were."

955
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:49,471
People go, "It isn't. I guess
he's segueing into his thought." Um...

956
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,972
It's always kids today.

957
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:54,517
I know there are people that
if I don't be specific with might go,

958
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:57,103
"I don't do that."
A 25-year old here going, "No."

959
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,773
It starts stopping at 25.

960
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:03,651
Let me take the tone out of my,
really try to stop it.

961
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:07,197
Many say, "Kids today..."
I know everyone wants to go...

962
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,908
They're brilliant, I'm not talking
about every kid.

963
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:12,077
The masses, you gotta admit, aren't...

964
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,205
It's not how it works.
It's not up for debate.

965
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,374
Blenders get better,
kids get smarter,

966
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,875
that's the way it is.

967
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,502
People go, "Kids today..."

968
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,504
If kids today had a Yelp review,

969
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:25,590
young adults, I should say,
it would be impeccable.

970
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:29,094
While they're doing things,
whatever they're fighting for,

971
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:33,181
people think it's up for debate,
40 years later we look back and go,

972
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,767
"They're right almost every fucking time."

973
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,854
Next time there's young people
doing something you don't understand,

974
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,399
you don't have to do it, but listen.

975
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:47,112
Go, "They have an amazing Yelp review,
of being on the right side of history."

976
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:48,905
You know when people go, "Ah".

977
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:52,617
The reason you may not think it,
you see them on their phones

978
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,702
and go, "They're on their phones."

979
00:56:54,786 --> 00:57:00,166
You don't hang out with young people,
so have a version of what they're like.

980
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:03,378
Here's an example.
Excuse me, I've had a few drinks.

981
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:05,964
You'd... Nobody...

982
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,466
The way you become prejudiced
to a group,

983
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,219
is there's none of those people
in your life.

984
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:14,889
Nobody goes,
"I'll have a hundred Jewish friends

985
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,766
and I hate Jewish people." No.

986
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,270
Except maybe Jewish people,
that's another thing.

987
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,815
The reason you don't
have any kids in your life,

988
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:27,277
say you work in an office,
a 19-year old's having a party.

989
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,699
He'll invite a 75-year old working there,
go, "They're so cool, gotta invite them!"

990
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,161
But they won't invite you
if they always hear you going,

991
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,330
"It was better.
There are no good bands these days.

992
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:43,585
Everything was better back then."
Who the fuck wants you at a party?

993
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,919
Even if you're right,

994
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:48,548
I need some dumb 40-year old
saying there are no good bands?

995
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,092
This is the 40-year old
who doesn't go see bands

996
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,596
doesn't go to hip places
where cool new bands play,

997
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,891
he watches bands on TV
and goes, "I was born in a better time."

998
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,686
Well, guess what?
Shama Lama Ding Dong's on your dime!

999
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:14,949
Hold on. Then... I got one more thing.
People go, "Oh, the kids, you know what?

1000
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,869
Kids today won't be able
to read maps in five years."

1001
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,914
Two things. Firstly, who gives a shit?

1002
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,751
Secondly, they're not going to be able
to churn butter, either!

1003
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:28,505
They can't make smoke signals.
Know why they can't read a map?

1004
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,090
And they can, I'm going with your premise,

1005
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,967
cos I gotta beat it outta ya.

1006
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,929
The reason they can't read a map,

1007
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:40,642
is cos they invented one on their phone
that reads to them, ya dumb fuck!

1008
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:58,993
And these are the same people
that are like,

1009
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:03,498
"Oh, you can't say anything anymore.
You can't say anything anymore."

1010
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:06,209
You know who says that?

1011
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:10,713
Most of the time,
people with nothing fucking to say!

1012
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,215
Know when they say that?

1013
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,677
Not when wanting to write poetry
or music everyone disagrees with,

1014
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,014
when corrected for using gay,
retarded, fag as adjectives.

1015
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,849
Further back, "Jew me down",

1016
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:25,019
that's when they,
"You can't say anything anymore!"

1017
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,022
What the fuck are you saying
that it inhibits you?

1018
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,691
What are your censors like?

1019
00:59:29,774 --> 00:59:33,111
"I can't say retarded or fag
or Jew me down...

1020
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,488
"what am I gonna talk about?"

1021
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:46,916
These are the same people
that go, "What's next?"

1022
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,710
We're onto you.

1023
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,880
Let's make it clear
what these "what's next?" people are.

1024
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,300
They act like they're OK with something,

1025
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:58,094
"I'm OK with gay marriage,
but what's next?"

1026
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,721
What do you give a shit?

1027
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:03,057
You sound like you're saying,
"I'm tired of evolving".

1028
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,935
I'm not asking you to stop it,

1029
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,396
I'm going "Know what it sounds like..."

1030
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:12,567
When you get tired of growing,
and go, "I already became OK with that,

1031
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:15,486
now I have to get to know this group
of people?"

1032
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,615
You sound like,
"Should I keep growing 'til I die?

1033
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,494
Next time there's a group of people
and I don't understand their lifestyle,

1034
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:27,665
I'll take a little time, learn about them
and end up loving them!"

1035
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,483
These same people go,
"There wasn't depression."

1036
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:57,654
They have some deluded thing,
"There wasn't depression back then."

1037
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:01,616
Yeah, people drank themselves to death!
There was shit going on.

1038
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:04,035
"We didn't have peanut allergies then.

1039
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:07,538
When I was growing up,
we didn't have peanut allergies."

1040
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,792
They were called "unexplained deaths",
you dumb fuck!

1041
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,586
That's how to close a show.
Goodnight everybody!

1042
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,715
One of you pooped. I know it.

1043
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,383
It was not me. Honest.

1044
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,509
You pooped.

1045
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,928
- Seriously...
-You pooped.

1046
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:06,973
It's very unprofessional
to ask who pooped.

1047
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:10,184
-It's unprofessional, you know.
-You pooped.

1048
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,354
It doesn't matter, you'll never find out,
I know.

1049
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,774
-You pooped. You pooped.
-I did not.

1050
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:19,569
-It's unprofessional.
-You pooped.
