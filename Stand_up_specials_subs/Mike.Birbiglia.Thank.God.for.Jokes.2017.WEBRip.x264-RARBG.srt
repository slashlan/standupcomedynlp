1
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,240
<i>Hi, I'm Jimmy Kimmel.</i>
<i>Can I get everyone to be quiet, please?</i>

2
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,655
<i>Can everyone be quiet? Please?</i>

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,411
<i>Everyone?</i>

4
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,915
<i>John. Where is John Krasinski?</i>

5
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,174
<i>John, please tell everyone to be quiet</i>
<i>and pay attention.</i>

6
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,473
<i>Could you do it</i>
<i>a little bit louder, please?</i>

7
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,853
<i>Thank you, John.</i>

8
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,180
<i>Good evening and welcome</i>
<i>to the 22nd Annual Gotham Awards.</i>

9
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:02,597
<i>You are there tonight to celebrate</i>
<i>the best independent films of 2012</i>

10
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:06,978
<i>and Matt Damon, whom we know</i>
<i>from such influential independent films</i>

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,647
<i>as </i>Ocean's Eleven,
Ocean's Twelve, Ocean's Thirteen,

12
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,157
The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy,
The Bourne Hypocrisy,

13
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,741
<i>and </i>The Legend of Bagger Vance.

14
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:21,287
<i>No one embodies the spirit of indie</i>
<i>like Matt Damon.</i>

15
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,503
<i>Anyway, I know you're eating</i>
<i>and telling your friends</i>

16
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,714
<i>about how much other people's money</i>
<i>you lost this year.</i>

17
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,464
<i>But we're about to get started,</i>
<i>and I would like you to pay attention</i>

18
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,547
<i>because I think</i>
<i>you will be happy you did.</i>

19
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,762
<i>The man you're about</i>
<i>to enjoy is very funny.</i>

20
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,683
<i>He, too, is an independent filmmaker.</i>

21
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,641
<i>He made an excellent movie this year</i>
<i>called </i>Sleepwalk with Me,

22
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,563
<i>and he is here tonight to entertain you</i>

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,521
<i>more than Matt Damon could ever</i>
<i>dream of doing, quite frankly.</i>

24
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,612
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please put</i>
<i>your drinks down for five seconds</i>

25
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,569
<i>and give a very warm welcome</i>
<i>to Mike Birbiglia.</i>

26
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,669
So...

27
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,050
Okay. Thank you.

28
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,635
Thank you, guys.

29
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,064
Well...

30
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,681
That was four years ago.

31
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,649
And the reason I show you that
is 'cause that video played

32
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,821
before what ended up being one
of the strangest nights of my life.

33
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,571
Because when Jimmy Kimmel
said John Krasinski's name,

34
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:37,574
John Krasinski was there, and he stood up,
and he told everyone to be quiet.

35
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,038
And by "everyone," I mean, Matt Damon.

36
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,657
And Amy Adams and Claire Danes
and Harvey Weinstein,

37
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,167
all these fancy people.

38
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,498
And somehow, I was hosting this event.

39
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:53,005
I'm not being falsely modest.
I get that we're all here right now.

40
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,682
But I also know,
at some point this week,

41
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,851
you told someone
where you were going tonight

42
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,600
and that person said, "Who?"

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,515
And you said some things I'd done.
They said, "What's that?"

44
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,986
You said, "Go back to bed, Grandma,"
'cause she's sleeping, but...

45
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,618
I'm a niche, I understand that. But...

46
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,832
this is a really big deal for me,

47
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,711
and I was so anxious for the week
leading up to the event.

48
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,789
And I couldn't sleep,
I was short of breath.

49
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,884
The night before,
I said to my wife, "Clo..."

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,170
Her name is Jen.

51
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,963
I said-- I said, "Clo...

52
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,719
I think this might be a disaster."

53
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,932
She said, "Mo...

54
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,684
why do you think that?"

55
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,055
I said,
"I've been a comedian for 15 years,

56
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,943
and what I've learned
is that you should never tell jokes

57
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,531
to the people who the jokes are about."

58
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,695
My wife had the perfect answer for this,
and I'll tell you what it was later.

59
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,452
But jokes are something
I think about all the time.

60
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,195
They're a volatile type of speech.
Just look at the news.

61
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,868
The <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> incident two years ago

62
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,957
where these ten satirists were killed

63
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,253
for drawing a disrespectful cartoon
of Muhammad,

64
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,377
who the killers believed
to be the prophet of Allah,

65
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:20,045
their lord and savior,
which, by the way, he might be.

66
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,189
I have no horse in that race.

67
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,653
Muhammad seems like a nice guy.
Jesus was popular with 12 dudes.

68
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,192
Buddha's confusing. I'm pretty sure
he's an elephant or a sumo wrestler.

69
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,447
The point is...

70
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:45,293
that these were comedy writers like me,
and they were murdered.

71
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,328
I was so shocked by this. At the time,
I remember talking to everybody about it.

72
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,214
And my mother said to me,

73
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:56,171
"Can't these writers just write jokes
that aren't offensive?"

74
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:00,883
And I thought about it.
I said, "I'm not sure that's possible,

75
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:05,887
because all jokes are offensive...

76
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,305
to someone."

77
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,439
I'll give you an example.

78
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,320
My wife does this thing
that drives me crazy.

79
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,700
She's late for everything,
and I'm an on-time person.

80
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,779
Round of applause
if you're a late person, typically.

81
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:30,078
Few people. So, what late people
don't understand about us on-time people

82
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,503
is that we hate you. And...

83
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,671
the reason why we hate you

84
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,223
is that it's so easy to be on time.

85
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,345
You just have to be early,
and early lasts for hours.

86
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,429
And on-time just lasts a second,
and then you're late forever.

87
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,977
Welcome to the show.

88
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,598
Thanks for being here.

89
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,402
Thanks for coming.
We were just talking about you.

90
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,864
So, late people always try
to re-brand "late."

91
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,988
They'll say, "I'm fashionably late,"

92
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,285
which is like saying,
"I'm stylishly racist."

93
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,117
Which is another thing about late people.
A lot of them are racist.

94
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:19,377
And the reason these late racists
drive me crazy...

95
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,971
is they're often so good-looking.

96
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,140
I mean, you ever get ready for something
with a late person?

97
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,970
They look into their closet
like it's Narnia.

98
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,676
Like it's an infinite well
of possibilities.

99
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,477
On-time people are just like,
"This is what I look like."

100
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,567
Sorry about that.

101
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,445
The reason I'm an expert in this
is that I was raised by late people.

102
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,782
My parents are laties, and--

103
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,457
When I was a kid,
my mom used to pick me up

104
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,419
from my swim class at the YMCA,
90 minutes after the class would end.

105
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,921
I know. She was like the cable company.

106
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:05,974
"I will pick you up between the hours
of 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m."

107
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,806
I was a ten-year-old child just standing
on the street corner

108
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,890
in a dripping wet bathing suit
and flip-flops.

109
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,346
My mom wasn't on the way.

110
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:21,732
She was at the book club
talking about <i>The Color Purple.</i>

111
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,109
I was like, "Mom, I <i>am</i> the color purple!"

112
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,791
One year, we went on a family vacation,

113
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:36,618
and we left for the airport
45 minutes before our flight took off.

114
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,586
We lived 45 minutes away from the airport.

115
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,341
My dad shouted at the security guard
like it was his fault.

116
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,422
This is the '80s,

117
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:49,427
when airport security consisted
of a high-five and a pat on the ass.

118
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,019
It was a different time for late people.
It was the golden age.

119
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,194
And then I married a late person,
like I said, and it's an issue.

120
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,193
This week, we were heading to yoga,

121
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,775
which is why I look excellent
and feel excellent.

122
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,329
I yearn for the day
that doesn't get a laugh.

123
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,750
I'm not even sure why we're laughing,
but I'll go with it.

124
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,830
So...

125
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,328
we're heading to yoga. My wife says,
"Wait for me, I'm not ready."

126
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,998
Which is silly 'cause you don't have
to be ready for yoga,

127
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,837
'cause all it is is trying not
to fart while stretching.

128
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,180
And that's my life already
without the stretching.

129
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,471
And clearly...

130
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,847
clearly, I don't belong in yoga.
It wasn't designed for male humans.

131
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,984
And you can tell when the instructor says,

132
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,191
"I want you to reach your hand back
towards your bra strap,

133
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,943
and then lift up your leg
unless you're on your period."

134
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,276
I'm like, "I'm pretty sure none
of that applies to me.

135
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:53,581
I've only had my period once.
I'm not even sure that's what that was."

136
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,373
Some of the poses are outrageous.
The other day, the instructor goes,

137
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,917
"I want you to push your chest
into the mat

138
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,051
and your butt in the air,

139
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:09,008
and then pull up the front
of your mat like a slut."

140
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:17,772
I was like, "All right."
I was trying to be a team player.

141
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:23,349
I was like, "I'm a bad girl.
I'm a yoga slut down on my luck...

142
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,396
trying to forge a mind-body connection."

143
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:32,534
And then she goes, "That's right, pull up
the front of your mat like a sled."

144
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,292
Minor adjustment.

145
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,328
Let me just close my butt.

146
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,884
So, my wife says,
"Wait for me, I'm not ready."

147
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,506
And I held my ground.
I go, "I'm not gonna wait for you

148
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,894
'cause you're a late person.
I'm an on-time person.

149
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,061
I don't want that entering
into our marriage

150
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,520
'cause I feel like
it's going really well so far."

151
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,481
Try to put a positive spin on it.

152
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,562
And she goes, "Fine."

153
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,107
Passive-aggressive--
classic for late people.

154
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,778
And then she says,

155
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:18,083
"Save a mat next to your mat,
for me, in class."

156
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,659
I said, "Clo, I'm not gonna do that

157
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,171
'cause I have more allegiance
to my fellow on-time people

158
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,545
than I do to you, my own wife."

159
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,763
And that didn't go well.

160
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,220
And so--

161
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,261
So, I felt bad.

162
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:42,597
And then I get to class,
and I put down my mat.

163
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,694
Then I put down a mat next to my mat
for my wife.

164
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,520
And this woman comes up, she goes,
"Do you mind if I put my mat right here?"

165
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,897
I was like, "Actually, my wife is..."

166
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,817
Sometimes I'm so polite,
I don't even finish sentences.

167
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
This other woman comes up, she goes...

168
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,038
I was like...

169
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,418
We were like deferent whales.

170
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,427
Which is another pose I'm working on.

171
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:24,061
Class fills up, 100% full,
wall-to-wall sluts.

172
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:31,021
Except for the empty mat next to my mat,
because my wife decided, arbitrarily,

173
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,987
she just wasn't gonna come
to class that day.

174
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,198
I know!

175
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:39,698
The ultimate late person move!

176
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,949
Absence!

177
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,210
Class-- class ends.

178
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,092
Empty mat.

179
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,090
All that people are gonna assume
is that my wife is dead.

180
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,683
Or I've invented the fictional concept
of having a wife

181
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,722
so I can have this weird
double-wide super mat.

182
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:10,308
The most selfish possible move
in the most socialist of exercises.

183
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:14,976
And this woman comes up.
She says, "I hope your wife is okay."

184
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,120
Which is the yoga way of saying,
"We hate you."

185
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,038
But that's just my side of the story.
In fairness to my wife,

186
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,793
if she were here tonight, she'd be like,
"Yeah, but you're not telling them..."

187
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,746
And I'd be like, "Excuse me, ma'am.
There's a show going on."

188
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,468
She'd be escorted out of the building.

189
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,549
I've done it before, I'll do it again.

190
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:49,229
That's what I love about jokes.
They're just your side of the story.

191
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,864
They're your opinion, which isn't
to say they're always just opinions.

192
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,979
Sometimes they're an externalization
of your inner thoughts,

193
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,567
and often your inner thoughts
are inappropriate.

194
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,407
I was at my urologist recently.

195
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,830
Just chillin'. No, I had a--

196
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,092
I had a symptom. Don't repeat this.

197
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,005
I had a symptom where--

198
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,342
This is hard to say.

199
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,300
I had a thing where, when my wife
and I would have sex,

200
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:29,178
I would have a pins-and-needles sensation
in my urethra

201
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,477
the moment I would ejaculate.

202
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,482
Which at first was exciting.

203
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,777
At first, I thought, "Ohh.

204
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,074
Maybe this is a new type of orgasm.

205
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,576
Maybe I've broken through."

206
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,792
But then the pain didn't go away.
I was like, "Oh, no!"

207
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,924
It's like when you're eating spicy food
and you're like,

208
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,213
"That's hot. That's hot! That's too hot!"

209
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,514
But it was with my penis.

210
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,849
Which is much higher stakes
than your tongue,

211
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,103
which is your mouth penis, in a way.

212
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,269
Nobody calls it that, but--

213
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,279
So, I explained this to my doctor--
not in these words--

214
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,873
and he's unfazed by it.
He goes, "It's not a big deal.

215
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,540
It's probably a muscular thing.

216
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:32,039
You're just trying too hard
when you have sex."

217
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,581
And I said, "You're telling me."
But I didn't--

218
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,708
I didn't say it. I just thought that.
I was like...

219
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,928
He was like, "Is there something wrong
with your head?" And, uh...

220
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,059
'Cause I don't say a lot
of jokes offstage.

221
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,388
I just think them.

222
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:52,733
He was like, "Is there something wrong
with your head?"

223
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,559
I go, "No, I'm a comedian."

224
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,356
He goes, "You're a comedian?"

225
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,145
I go, "You're a doctor?"

226
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,775
But I didn't say it. I just thought it.
I was, like...

227
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,032
You know?

228
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,616
He really didn't believe me,
he goes, "If you're a comedian,

229
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:14,503
how come you're not funny now?"

230
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:22,088
What I wanted to say was I'm gonna
take this conversation we're having

231
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,971
and then repeat that to strangers.

232
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,715
And then that's the joke.

233
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:33,184
You're the joke... later.

234
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:43,529
But I didn't say it.
I just thought it, and, uh...

235
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,279
I could say these jokes.

236
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,861
But when you have your pants
at your ankles

237
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,236
and a rectal thermometer in your butt,
you're thinking,

238
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,993
"This might not be the right time."

239
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,462
I feel like we're led to believe
this false cliché from romantic comedies

240
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,421
that we're all just whipping off jokes
all the time.

241
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,252
Like, we meet a girl in a coffee shop

242
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,417
and we're like,
"What's in your latte? Cum?"

243
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,676
And she'll be like, "You're hilarious!

244
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,552
We should be married in 90 minutes."

245
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,097
But in real life, that guy gets arrested.

246
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:18,476
Or runs for president.
Like, if you think about--

247
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,776
If you think about jokes--

248
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:34,332
If you think about jokes,
you can't tell jokes in life, almost ever.

249
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,080
Like, at work or school.
Or the airport is a great example.

250
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,997
I read a story where a guy sneezed
on a plane,

251
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,665
looks around and he goes,
"I have Ebola."

252
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,596
Here's why that's not a good joke.

253
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,523
They landed the plane.

254
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,693
They landed the plane.

255
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,152
And they're met by the guys
in hazmat suits.

256
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,903
And his defense was, "I'm joking."

257
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:12,065
Which is always this catch-all defense
when people say dumb things.

258
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,786
You can't tell jokes at work, basically,
because at some point in history,

259
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,868
some idiot showed up at work,
and was like, "Nice tits, Betsy!"

260
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,866
And Betsy's like, "What?"

261
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,054
And that guy's like, "I'm joking!"

262
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,419
And the boss is like...

263
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,177
"Uh...

264
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,010
no more jokes!"

265
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,729
Jokes have been ruined

266
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,811
by people who aren't good
at telling jokes.

267
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,196
A joke should never end with "I'm joking."

268
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,856
Or "Git-R-Done."

269
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,879
So, it's the week before I host
the Gotham Awards,

270
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,789
and I start writing the jokes.

271
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,667
And it felt like
sort of a no-win situation:

272
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,175
How do I make jokes that are relevant
to the people in the audience

273
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,009
but don't make them hate me?

274
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,854
And so, I started with jokes about myself.

275
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,220
I wrote, "It's an honor to be here,

276
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,138
because 13 years ago,

277
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,346
I was a coat check person at this event.

278
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:30,228
And here I am hosting,
and I made more money checking coats."

279
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,859
Which is true.

280
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,414
Yeah, I remember that period
of my life so well.

281
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:43,753
I was so broke, and I was actually living
on an air mattress in Queens,

282
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,001
and I couldn't afford a dresser
for my clothes.

283
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,884
When you're broke,
everything is just low to the ground.

284
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,963
You know? You--

285
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,972
You roll off your air mattress
in the morning,

286
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,814
grab pants from the floor,

287
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:03,309
you cook noodles on a hot plate.

288
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,652
One falls out of your mouth,
you're like, "It's not too far."

289
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,607
The only way you could get lower
is if you died.

290
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,412
And I moved to New York

291
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,953
'cause there's all these
comedy clubs here,

292
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:26,617
but they didn't want me
'cause I wasn't good at it.

293
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:32,167
So, what I did was I drove
my mom's station wagon around the country

294
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,474
to areas of lesser comedy concentration,

295
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,298
places like Ohio,
West Virginia, New Jersey, and...

296
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,139
Not a joke, but thanks.

297
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,346
And, actually, I bought my mom's car.

298
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,767
I always like to point that out
because I found out recently

299
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,356
that sometimes when parents have faith
in their child's dreams...

300
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,414
they'll give them their car.

301
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,993
My mom got the full Blue Book value.

302
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,370
She was like,
"This guy just doesn't have it."

303
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,456
And...

304
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:11,876
I remember this rock-bottom moment

305
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,511
where I'm driving back
from a comedy club in New Jersey

306
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,128
to my air mattress in Queens,

307
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,045
and this cop just points at me
and waves me over.

308
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,215
When you're broke, cops will pull you over
if you have a crappy car

309
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,175
just to see what else you got going wrong,
you know?

310
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,059
Yeah.

311
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,901
And he says, "License and registration."

312
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:36,401
As I'm pulling out my license,
I'm realizing it's expired by three weeks.

313
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,026
And I had that moment where I think,
"Should I preface this conversation

314
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,945
with this key piece of information?"

315
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,623
Like, "You're not gonna like this."
You know what I mean?

316
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,372
"Same team. We both think I'm an idiot."

317
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:49,456
And...

318
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,549
It was actually worse than just that.

319
00:20:55,629 --> 00:21:00,719
He came back and goes, "Did you know
that your license is suspended?"

320
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,143
Yeah, I didn't even know
what that meant.

321
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,141
I was very naive, and so I--

322
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,523
I had an unpaid speeding ticket
from high school.

323
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,481
So I said to him, and I quote--

324
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,766
I said, "Yes.

325
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:17,942
No.

326
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,664
Wait. What does 'suspended' mean?"

327
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,958
And he said, "Please step out of the car."
And I get out of the car.

328
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,004
He says, "You're under arrest."

329
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,957
I said, "No, I don't think so."

330
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,546
He says, "I'm sure of it."

331
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,096
And then he cuffs me
to prove the whole thing. And--

332
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:52,563
Round of applause if you've been arrested.
Has anyone been arrested before?

333
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,899
Few people. What did you--

334
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,611
Can I ask, what did you get arrested for?

335
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:05,238
I got arrested by a woman cop
and put in a headlock.

336
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,829
I don't like how you said "woman cop."

337
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,709
That was very obnoxious.

338
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,178
It really was. I don't--

339
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,887
I'm fine with it. It's a comedy show.
Anything can happen.

340
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:30,471
We're all friends here.
But it just did rub me the wrong way.

341
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,395
You know, women can be cops.

342
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,192
It's sort of part of the whole thing.

343
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,322
You said you're--

344
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,157
You're saying it like it's an anomaly.

345
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,369
And it's, like, a whole thing.

346
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,793
I only said it like that because I've been
getting my balls busted

347
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,252
for the last ten years over it.

348
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,542
Oh, okay.
Well, that doesn't make sense also.

349
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:04,046
But, uh-- but sure, yeah. So--

350
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:11,224
So, this crazy, out-of-nowhere,
woman cop shows up.

351
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,437
Well, get this: she's a lady.

352
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,146
Badge and everything.

353
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,820
And I said, "Cook me dinner!"
You know what she said?

354
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,735
She said,
"No, you're under arrest for a crime."

355
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,171
So...

356
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,959
Unbelievable.
You're really buried in this point.

357
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,755
I mean, there's nothing--

358
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,968
There's nothing you could say
that would vindicate you.

359
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,675
She put me in a headlock.

360
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,257
You already said that.

361
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:57,935
I feel like your talking points
are all wrong.

362
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,902
She put you in a headlock? Why?
First of all, what was your crime?

363
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:12,367
I got to a keg, and I got my cup of beer,

364
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,371
and I was waiting in line for the beer.

365
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,174
-And...
-You're leaving out so many details.

366
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,340
Where?!

367
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,720
Basic details!

368
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,892
We don't all have to be Ira Glass,
but come on!

369
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,479
Where-- where was this?

370
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,690
It was in the woods.

371
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:42,855
So--

372
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,903
So--

373
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,365
So--

374
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,750
No further questions, Your Honor.

375
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:08,632
It was in the woods.
It was in the woods.

376
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,853
I didn't even know ladies went
in the woods.

377
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,021
It was like seeing Bigfoot.

378
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,619
I will say this about being arrested.

379
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,463
It's a shocking experience
if you've never had it happen,

380
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,209
because they cuff you, and the cuffs hurt.

381
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:47,213
And the cops don't have to take you
to jail right away.

382
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:51,466
Like, I was cuffed in New Jersey
and sitting in the back of the cruiser.

383
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,010
I'm looking through the windshield,

384
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,263
the cop was just hanging out
with his cop buddies.

385
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:59,215
And they're laughing, making jokes,
like, "I arrested this guy for nothing."

386
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:02,808
You know, just like,
"What does 'suspended' mean?"

387
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:03,895
And...

388
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,856
I'm having the most traumatic moment
of my life.

389
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:11,202
It's like,
"I never knew I would be arrested.

390
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,698
I wear New Balance shoes."

391
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:14,991
You know, and--

392
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,622
And I'm nervous 'cause I'm afraid of cops.

393
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,874
I always thought I was most afraid
of bears,

394
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:27,036
but at least if a bear kills you,
everyone gets mad at the bear.

395
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,337
If a cop kills you,

396
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,050
30% of Americans are like,
"It's a hard job."

397
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,262
You know what I mean?

398
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,676
If a bear kills you,
they don't have a bear press conference

399
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:42,143
where all the bears stand behind
the murderous bear in solidarity,

400
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,596
and the bear commissioner steps forward,

401
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,896
and he's like,
"He's usually a pretty good bear.

402
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:53,322
He usually just eats honey
and is unaware of bees."

403
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,953
But cops will kill you.
That's, like, on the news and everything.

404
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,084
And so--

405
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:06,208
So, I'm nervous and I'm sweating.
I'm itchy. I had an itch on my face.

406
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,211
But I didn't have
any extremities available.

407
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,423
So, I'm looking around like the character
from<i> No Country for Old Men.</i>

408
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:16,466
And I see a door handle.
I'm like, "That's pointy."

409
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:21,812
And I reach over. I'm scratching my face
on the door handle

410
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,230
which creates more itchiness
on my cheek and my shoulder.

411
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:30,321
And then I'm just sort of
writhing around in circles,

412
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,649
like a dog trying
to shake off a medical cone.

413
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:37,985
And the cop looks back.
He's like, "We got a live one!

414
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:41,235
What the hell are you doing?"

415
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,826
I'm like, "Will you scratch my face?"

416
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,499
Apparently, they never do that.
Not once, ever.

417
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:53,796
As it turns out, no one's even asked,
which is crazy to me.

418
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,631
'Cause that's the itchiest backseat
I've ever been in.

419
00:27:56,717 --> 00:27:58,797
It's like a tickle fight back there...

420
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:02,135
with lice. I would have done anything
for a scratch.

421
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,102
I'd be like, "I'll let you use your gun,"

422
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,352
you know, which is pointy,
but obviously dangerous.

423
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:08,436
And so...

424
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,977
the officer books me
at the Weehawken, New Jersey, jail.

425
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,396
He even took the shoelaces out of my shoes

426
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,235
'cause apparently,
it's a very common thing

427
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,451
when people's licenses are suspended...

428
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,041
is they'll hang themselves.

429
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,499
I don't like to joke about it.
It's called suspension post-suspension.

430
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,594
It is...

431
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,676
all-too-common, under-reported.
And then--

432
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,850
And then he took a mug shot of me.

433
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,969
He knew I'd performed
at a comedy club that night.

434
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,846
So, he took an extra one,
and he put it in his pocket.

435
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,894
He goes, "This is in case
you ever get famous."

436
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,859
Which I thought was nice, you know?

437
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,609
I was like,
"At least he's rooting for me."

438
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,663
Sure, he's arresting me now.

439
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:08,406
But long-term, this guy sees it.

440
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,040
Which is more than I can say for my mom.

441
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,337
And so--

442
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,549
So, I had this one joke
about being a coat check person.

443
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:23,103
But increasingly, I'm getting so anxious
about hosting this event.

444
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,968
And so I called Jimmy Kimmel,

445
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:28,015
'cause I thought
that if I had a video like that,

446
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,890
it might give me some credibility
with the audience,

447
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:35,268
where it felt like every relevant topic
would be a minefield.

448
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:38,237
Which is always, by the way,
somewhat the case in comedy

449
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,148
when you perform
for a specific group of people.

450
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,658
Like, I remember
the most extreme example I've had.

451
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,451
I was performing
at a Christian college, and, uh...

452
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,208
It was a weird show.
It was in a giant gymnasium,

453
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,841
and there was a 30-foot crucifix
on the wall.

454
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,714
And I thought that was funny,
because I was thinking,

455
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,216
like, if Jesus were there,
what would he say?

456
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,431
Like, "Use the elliptical!"
You know, because--

457
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,403
Because I think about Jesus a lot.

458
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,358
I went to Catholic school
for nine years,

459
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,939
and they teach it to you
when you're so young, you're seven.

460
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,235
They're like, "There's this guy Jesus,
and he loves you.

461
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:21,649
And you love him, too, right?"

462
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,277
You're like, "Wait. Do I know this guy?"

463
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,993
And they're like,
"Oh, yeah, there's this guy Jesus,

464
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,914
who everybody loves
'cause he loves everybody.

465
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,913
And a long time ago, he died,
and it's not totally your fault.

466
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,246
So...

467
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,461
don't be scared or sad

468
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,343
'cause he's in heaven now with his dad,
who is also God.

469
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,131
There's this other thing
called The Holy Spirit

470
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,724
that no one really understands.

471
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,139
All three of these things are a cluster...

472
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,425
that are staring at you all the time."

473
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,349
If you have any questions,

474
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:53,733
just pop into that strange broom closet
in the corner

475
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,060
with Father Steven, who no one's done
a background check on.

476
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,194
Don't forget to mention
if you've been masturbating,

477
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,196
'cause he's fascinated by that.

478
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:08,238
And angry, but mostly fascinated, and--

479
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:12,828
Starts innocently enough,
as innocently as man-boy love can start.

480
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:16,173
You sort of accept there's this guy Jesus,
and he loves you,

481
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:19,039
but he's dead and he's bleeding,
but he's in great shape, and--

482
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,548
And I actually really enjoyed church
when I was a kid.

483
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:31,522
My favorite part was the hymns.
We'd sing this one that goes:

484
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,138
<i>♪ Christ has died ♪</i>

485
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,436
<i>♪ Christ is risen ♪</i>

486
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,980
<i>♪ Christ will come again ♪</i>

487
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:42,982
Thank you, guys.

488
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,695
You know that one? It's a hit.

489
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,584
It's been number one on the charts
for 47,000 weeks in a row.

490
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,084
Pretty sure it's gone myrrh,
at this point.

491
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,420
Yeah, that's right.

492
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:06,259
That's a rare myrrh joke.

493
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,053
That joke is comedy myrrh. And--

494
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,560
No, I love that song.

495
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,272
Lyrically, very concise.

496
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:25,403
You got Christ. He's the protagonist,
and then he died, which is sad.

497
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,525
Then he's risen, which is unexpected.

498
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,122
And then he'll come again, which--

499
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,029
I don't know, I'm--

500
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:38,044
I'm not sure I'm rooting for that part.
I feel like, you know, thanks for coming.

501
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,882
Appreciate the books, but--

502
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:53,756
Do we really want him to come again?
If he comes again, he's gonna be so mad.

503
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:00,687
He's gonna be like, "I don't understand.

504
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,690
How come these people are so rich
and these people are so poor?"

505
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:07,534
'Cause he's Jewish, right?
He'd have a Jewish affect.

506
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,658
"How come these people have thousands
of loaves,

507
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,331
and these people have half a loaf?"

508
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,749
'Cause he's a socialist.
He's a Jewish socialist.

509
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,500
He's the least popular modern demographic,
especially with Christians.

510
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,458
He's the original Bernie Sanders.
You know that, right?

511
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,667
I mean, Jesus--

512
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,434
Jesus would never win in the general.

513
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,064
But--

514
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,900
So, my brother Joe,
who's here with me tonight, he would--

515
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,733
He really taught me what jokes were
when I was a kid.

516
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,686
He used to sing parodies of these hymns

517
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,242
while we sang the actual hymns.

518
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,909
He was like the "Weird Al" Yankovic
of church.

519
00:34:00,497 --> 00:34:01,537
He'd go...

520
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:05,793
<i>♪ Christ has lied</i>
<i>Christ was imprisoned ♪</i>

521
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,707
<i>♪ Christ will come at ten ♪</i>

522
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:17,596
By far, my favorite line--
this idea that Christ will be arriving

523
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,597
at a very specific time.

524
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:24,484
Because Christ is an on-time person.
That's one thing you should know.

525
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,897
He's a punctual savior.

526
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,909
So, I'm talking about all this on stage

527
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:37,279
in this Christian college gymnasium,
and...

528
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,159
it's not connecting, you know?

529
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,589
And it was really sort of awkward
backstage after the show

530
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:56,514
between me and this guy who booked me.
He was just like, "Why?

531
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,020
Why would you talk about Jesus

532
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:08,479
for ten minutes on stage?"

533
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:10,145
And I didn't have the best answer,

534
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,653
but I feel like it's good enough
to share with you guys.

535
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,156
I said, "Jesus died...

536
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,075
so I could tell those jokes."

537
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,045
In fairness
to the Christian college organizer,

538
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,209
I'm a pretty safe bet
as far as comedians go,

539
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:38,758
I don't curse gratuitously on stage,
which has a lot to do with my mom.

540
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,721
No, really. When I moved to New York,
she was upset, and I'd go, "Why?"

541
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:47,477
She said, "I don't want you to become one
of those dirty comedians."

542
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,650
And I said, "Okay."

543
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:53,491
And she said, "You don't have to use
those words to be funny.

544
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:57,028
For example, Oprah's very funny."

545
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,541
And I said, "Maybe to Gayle.

546
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,208
Or even Stedman,
when they let him in on it.

547
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,875
But I don't know--

548
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,974
I don't know
if you understand my goals, Mom.

549
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,051
I'm not trying to be the queen
of daytime."

550
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,734
Because my mom and I are so close,

551
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:29,229
I really tried not to curse a lot
over the years on stage.

552
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,562
At this point,
I've released four comedy albums,

553
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:34,068
and none of them have
the explicit lyrics label on them.

554
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,110
But sometimes,
I feel conflicted about that

555
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,324
'cause a lot of comedians I admire most
did curse on stage.

556
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,116
Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor.

557
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,249
And some of them who famously don't curse
are secretly criminals.

558
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,219
This is fun for me, just watching
50 people mouth, "Bill Cosby."

559
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,484
And then there's this odd thing
about not cursing,

560
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:11,349
which is, sometimes you're booked
in places just for that reason.

561
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:14,228
Like, a few years ago, I got booked
to perform with the Muppets,

562
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,105
which is a great honor.
I grew up on the Muppets.

563
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,744
It was a Canadian television special
hosted by them,

564
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:22,702
and I had to follow Fozzie Bear.

565
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,988
I'll tell you something about Fozzie Bear.

566
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,826
He's actually a pretty good comedian.

567
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,960
I feel like I have to make that point

568
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,875
because the joke of Fozzie, I guess,
is that he's a bad comedian

569
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,547
who also is a bear.

570
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,892
But Fozzie--

571
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,267
Following Fozzie is nearly impossible.

572
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:59,315
Like, he's killing on stage, killing.

573
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,282
Even when he's not killing, he's killing

574
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,072
'cause he's got
that joke parachute catchphrase:

575
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,947
"Wocka Wocka Wocka!"

576
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,872
Which is his "Git-R-Done," by the way.

577
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:13,424
I don't know if you've thought
of that before, but...

578
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,996
I'm watching Fozzie from the wings,
and it's dawning on me, like,

579
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:23,337
this show isn't gonna go well for me,
for a very specific reason.

580
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:28,636
When people go to see the Muppets,
they don't want to see people.

581
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:35,191
They just want to see more Muppets.

582
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,692
When you're watching <i>Sesame Street</i>

583
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:41,494
and Gordon and Maria wander in the frame,
and you're like, "Out of there."

584
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,826
We want to see more of the creature
who lives in the garbage.

585
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,246
So, Fozzie's killing,

586
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:57,092
and then he's heckled off the stage
by Statler and Waldorf.

587
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,628
That's the gay couple that lives
in the balcony.

588
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,670
If that's not the case, I'm very confused.

589
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,887
They go to theater seven nights a week,
and they bitch about everything.

590
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:07,299
I mean, what--

591
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,772
What are the clues here? And so...

592
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,938
Statler and Waldorf heckled Fozzie,
and then they introduced me,

593
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,481
which is an insane precedent
for hecklers--

594
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:23,396
this idea that if a heckler
defeats the comedian,

595
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,066
they're now in charge of the show?

596
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,491
It's like if a streaker ran
onto Yankee Stadium,

597
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:33,907
they just threw him a mitt.
They're like, "Third base!"

598
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:40,246
"I don't have a uniform!" You know?

599
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:48,046
So, they introduced me, and they're mean.
That's Statler and Waldorf's thing.

600
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:51,216
One of them goes,
"This next guy walks in his sleep."

601
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:54,516
"Oh, yeah?
I like sleeping during his act. Ha!"

602
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:05,402
"Please welcome Mike Birbiglia."
And I jog onto stage.

603
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:11,486
And I'm so flustered by being pre-heckled
by these surreal puppets,

604
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,826
that I forgot to bring my stool.

605
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:17,792
I get to the center, and I look around.
I go, "Ah, fuck!"

606
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,142
I'll tell you who doesn't like
the word "fuck."

607
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,226
People who have purchased tickets
to see the Muppets...

608
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,070
and the Muppets.

609
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,913
The people in the audience were like...

610
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,456
The Muppets were like...

611
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:12,175
I go, "Sorry about that!"
And I jog off stage.

612
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,356
And I jog back on stage,
this time with the stool.

613
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,649
There's nothing I can do
to get the audience on my side.

614
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,573
Because not only am I the guy who cursed
on <i>The Muppets,</i>

615
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,863
as far as these people know,

616
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,656
I'm the guy who curses exclusively
on <i>The Muppets,</i>

617
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,122
not even in the context of a joke.

618
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:40,253
I'm just this guy...

619
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,040
who jogs on stage,

620
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:47,338
says "fuck," and then jogs off stage.

621
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,215
I'm like the villain of the Muppets.

622
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,179
I'm, like, Fuck Monster.

623
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:04,355
Which is what I've been trying
to get my wife to call me for years.

624
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,029
So, I'm bombing on <i>The Muppets.</i>

625
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:16,244
It's literally the opposite
of my childhood dream come true.

626
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:21,576
I remember as a kid thinking like,
"Maybe someday, I'll be on<i> The Muppets</i>."

627
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,964
But I never thought, "Maybe someday,
I'll be on <i>The Muppets,</i>

628
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,173
and it's not gonna go so well."

629
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,298
After ten minutes, I walk off stage--
I'm not making this up.

630
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,426
I was consoled by Kermit.

631
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,810
He was like, "I thought you were good."

632
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,654
I was like, "Not now!"

633
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,935
Threw him up against the wall.

634
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,988
No, it was--

635
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:59,122
I felt terrible.
I just felt like I failed so profoundly.

636
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,162
But then the more I mulled it over,

637
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,495
the more I thought
maybe I'm being overly prude

638
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,421
on behalf of the Muppets.

639
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:09,917
If you think about it, the Muppets,
they've seen a lot.

640
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:13,006
The Muppets are, like, 70 years old.

641
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:17,261
Like, you think when the cameras
aren't rolling, Animal doesn't curse?

642
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,635
You think Animal's never like...

643
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:25,189
"This fucking snare drum
sounds like shit!"

644
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:32,279
I'm pretty sure Janice has tried heroin.

645
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,570
You know what I mean?

646
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,742
You think Janice is never like,

647
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:43,326
"Kermit, I am, like, so fucked up.

648
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,622
Can I use your leg to tie off my arm?"

649
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:52,551
That's right.
That's a Muppets heroin joke.

650
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:58,180
And I'm pretty sure if there was a line,
I stepped over it right there.

651
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:05,846
That's what you always have to think about
when you're writing jokes,

652
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,765
is sort of, where is the line?

653
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,484
And you don't want to cross it,
but you want to go near it.

654
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,071
You know, it's subjective,
sort of where the line is.

655
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,283
That's where it becomes complicated.
And that's what I was mulling over

656
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:22,834
as I was flying back to New York
the day before hosting the Gotham Awards.

657
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,330
I was on the plane. I was writing jokes,

658
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,463
and I was eating a chicken salad sandwich
on walnut raisin bread.

659
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,630
And I remember that because, actually,
the flight attendant came over,

660
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:38,092
and he was like, "Excuse me,
are there nuts in your sandwich?"

661
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,604
I knew it wasn't gonna end well.

662
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:45,104
Because that sentence never ends with:
"'Cause I love nuts!

663
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,636
Nuts, nuts, nuts, nuts, nuts, nuts, nuts!

664
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,308
They're great in everything!

665
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,937
Sprinkle them on your sundae!
They're the building blocks of pesto!"

666
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:57,696
Which they are
and nobody's talking about it.

667
00:44:57,778 --> 00:44:59,318
And so, as--

668
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,911
So, as I responded,
I just kept eating the sandwich.

669
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:07,996
I was like...

670
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,000
"I think that there might be...

671
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:16,457
walnuts in the bread."

672
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:24,851
"Actually, you can't eat that on the plane
'cause the woman seated by the window...

673
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,891
has a nut allergy."

674
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:33,484
"I won't feed them to her.

675
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,322
Or rub them on her face."

676
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,700
"Actually, she'll have a reaction

677
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,535
even if there are nuts

678
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,206
in the air."

679
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,051
"Nuts in the air?"

680
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:05,681
Which just so happens
to be my favorite hip-hop song.

681
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:12,227
I tried to be respectful.
I said to the woman,

682
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,481
"Are you serious?
You'll have a reaction if there are nuts

683
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,775
in the air?"

684
00:46:20,069 --> 00:46:23,199
She said, "Yeah,
I'll have a reaction if there are nuts

685
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:24,821
in the air."

686
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,208
"You shouldn't leave the house.

687
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,010
There are nuts everywhere."

688
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,545
And I was so hungry,
I said to the flight attendant,

689
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:51,767
I said, "Is there anywhere
where I can finish my sandwich?"

690
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,021
"You can finish it...

691
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,864
in the bathroom."

692
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,989
"Okay." And I head out.

693
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,235
And I walked into a JetBlue bathroom,

694
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,036
and I ate a chicken salad sandwich.

695
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:15,001
I'm experiencing that great symphony
of smells--

696
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:19,502
just bathroom and antiseptic,
mayonnaise, and I'm gagging.

697
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,337
And I'm eating more of the sandwich,
and I'm gagging.

698
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:25,763
And I'm eating more of the sandwich.
And I realized at that moment,

699
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,013
that I have what is called
a fecal airspace allergy.

700
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,136
And--

701
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:36,095
Well, you know,
it isn't just if I eat feces.

702
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,647
It is if--

703
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,237
It's if the feces...

704
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:47,114
are in the air.

705
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:51,365
If the feces are in the air...

706
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,496
I'll have a reaction.

707
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,502
All right. So, you know
who doesn't like this story,

708
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,337
are people with nut allergies.

709
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:07,432
And you know who does like this story?
Everyone else.

710
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,510
And...

711
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,433
I feel genuinely conflicted about that,

712
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:17,346
'cause there's almost a thousand people
in this room together right now.

713
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:22,106
And about 997 of us are like,
"Ha ha! Nuts in the air."

714
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,570
And then three of us secretly are like,
"That's my life."

715
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,864
You know? And I don't--

716
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:34,754
I don't want to be that to you,

717
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:38,869
but jokes have to be about something.

718
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,420
I told that story last year
in San Francisco,

719
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,094
and this kid came to me after the show,

720
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,552
and he asked me
if I would sign his EpiPen.

721
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,102
'Cause he has a nut allergy.

722
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:55,178
And if he has a reaction,
his mom has to spike him in his leg

723
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:56,516
so he doesn't die.

724
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,694
And I was really moved by this,

725
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,939
'cause that's precisely my sense of humor.

726
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,821
I have jokes on my albums about having
a bladder tumor when I was 19,

727
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,820
and how I was once hit by a drunk driver,

728
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,282
how I have
a life-threatening sleep disorder.

729
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,994
And those are my best jokes.

730
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,784
That's sort of what I'm interested in.

731
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:18,288
So, I said to his mom, "How many times
have you had to spike him?"

732
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,622
And she said, "Three times."

733
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:21,791
I thought, "Wow.

734
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:27,717
This kid almost died three times...

735
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,255
so I could tell that joke."

736
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,772
So I wanted to dedicate this show tonight
to him.

737
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,148
He's dead.

738
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,899
I'm joking.

739
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:51,281
Wocka Wocka Wocka!

740
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,906
Git-R-Done!

741
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,634
I'm flying back to New York
and writing jokes,

742
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,051
and I'm researching the guests of honor
at the Gotham Awards.

743
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:12,891
And I see that David O. Russell
is gonna be there.

744
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,428
And David O. Russell is one
of my absolute favorite directors,

745
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,313
dating back to when I was in high school.

746
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:22,900
I remember seeing his movie
<i>Flirting with Disaster</i> in the theater.

747
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,438
And I laughed so hard,

748
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,611
and then he went on to have this
illustrious Oscar Award-winning career--

749
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:31,652
<i>Silver Linings Playbook</i>,
<i>American Hustle</i>, <i>Three Kings.</i>

750
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:36,327
And I'm reading about him,
and this joke occurs to me on the plane,

751
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,788
and I just start laughing maniacally,
alone.

752
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,923
Not the best look. You know, just like...

753
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:47,878
"I have Ebola!"

754
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,716
I'm laughing for two reasons.

755
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,720
One, at the joke,
and two, at the absurdity

756
00:50:55,803 --> 00:51:00,023
that I would tell this joke the next night

757
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:02,479
when he would be sitting right there.

758
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,849
And so the moment I land, I call my wife.

759
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:08,647
I said, "Clo, listen to this joke."

760
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,942
And she laughed really hard,
and I'll tell it to you guys in a moment.

761
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,737
But first, I just want
to say one last thing about jokes,

762
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:19,203
which is that I think jokes,
at their best, have the ability

763
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,575
to make us all feel closer to one another.

764
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:22,712
I think one of the--

765
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:26,288
My favorite things about marriage
is that you can share jokes

766
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:29,415
with your wife or husband
that are funny to you

767
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,673
and that person and no one else,
other than maybe your cat.

768
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,177
Because when you have a cat,
your barometer for humor--

769
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,308
out the window.

770
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,686
Last summer, my wife and I went
on a trip to Massachusetts.

771
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,019
And I called it "Catsachusetts,"
which is not funny.

772
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:52,736
But in our house,
it was the joke of the year!

773
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,118
I was like,
"We're going to Catsachusetts."

774
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,528
My wife's like, "Aah!"

775
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,076
I was like, "Aah!"

776
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,790
Our cat was like, "Aah!"

777
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,787
Because everyone loves a good pun
when you have a cat.

778
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:15,377
So, we drive to Catsachusetts.

779
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,009
When we arrive, my wife has a headache,

780
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,224
and she asks me if I'll acclimate Ivan--
that's our cat-- to the bedroom.

781
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:23,596
'Cause he's an indoor cat,

782
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:26,852
and you can't just put an indoor cat
into a house because he'll explode.

783
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,067
I bring him in the bedroom,
and while I'm there,

784
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,373
my wife discovers that there were mice
in the house.

785
00:52:39,448 --> 00:52:43,488
And it was worse than just mice.
They were parasitic mice.

786
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:48,167
They have toxoplasmosis,
which means they have a parasite in them,

787
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,628
and they want it in you.

788
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,748
They're unafraid of cats.
They're unafraid of people.

789
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,005
We discovered this because my wife
was watching TV on the couch,

790
00:52:55,089 --> 00:52:57,589
and she looked next to her,
and there was a mouse,

791
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,934
and he was watching TV also.

792
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,851
And she screamed,

793
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,061
and he just looked up at her
like Stuart Little.

794
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:10,311
Like, "Hey! What's going on?
I don't like this show, either.

795
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:14,528
I don't know why all those women
would want to marry that one guy."

796
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:22,243
She pushes him off the couch,
and he doesn't even run away.

797
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:27,294
He doesn't even scurry,
which is a verb invented for mice.

798
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,455
He just walks into the kitchen
like a roommate.

799
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,085
He was like,
"Fine, I'll go in the other room.

800
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,934
I just think you're overreacting."

801
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,802
Then he did a confessional
into the mouse cam in the kitchen.

802
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,847
He was like,
"I'm not here to make friends.

803
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:49,102
I'm here to win.
I was here before they came.

804
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,774
I'll be here when they're gone.
I'm a mouse."

805
00:53:51,854 --> 00:53:54,274
That's from <i>Real Mousewives</i>
<i>of Catsachusetts.</i>

806
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:02,611
That night, I'm sound asleep, and my wife
wakes me up by grabbing my face.

807
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:09,911
She says, "Mo, Ivan found the mouse.

808
00:54:09,997 --> 00:54:12,917
You need to get the mouse."

809
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:15,464
And I said, "Clo...

810
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:19,174
we have a cat.

811
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:24,181
We do everything for the cat.

812
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:25,891
We give him food.

813
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:29,271
We give him an apartment
that he thinks is the world.

814
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:34,397
We set aside an area in the apartment
for him to poop in

815
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,030
that we clean more often
than the area where we poop.

816
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:44,407
We have a gentleman's agreement

817
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:50,660
that in the unlikely event that a mouse
should walk through that door...

818
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,250
and that day may never come...

819
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,251
that he will murder that mouse,

820
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:02,715
and we will never speak
of that mouse again,

821
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:06,429
and that cat will receive protection."

822
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,353
That's from<i> Catfather.</i>

823
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,935
Clo says, "Mo, get the mouse."

824
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,397
And she hands me a cup.

825
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,115
I take the cup,

826
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,739
walk towards the mouse.

827
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:33,035
Mouse walks towards me.

828
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,326
I walk away from the mouse.

829
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,670
I put the cup over the mouse.
I put a magazine under the cup,

830
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,505
and I take him in the backyard.

831
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,880
I stick him in the forest,

832
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:50,097
where I can only assume
that he walked into the mouth of a wolf.

833
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,353
The next day we drove home,

834
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,943
and from that day forward,
we have called that state...

835
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,192
Mouseachusetts.

836
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:08,623
So, I want to point out something special,
that happened there at the end

837
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,869
which is, a few minutes ago,

838
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:14,541
I prefaced the story
with a Massachusetts-based pun.

839
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:17,712
Catsachusetts.

840
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,463
Which we all agreed as a group:

841
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,720
Not funny.

842
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:32,468
Moments ago...

843
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:38,188
I concluded the story with another
Massachusetts-based pun.

844
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,360
It was nearly identical.

845
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,453
It was Mouseachusetts.

846
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:55,951
But that time, we applauded.

847
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:00,543
Which means...

848
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,134
in a way...

849
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,046
it's like we're married.

850
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,553
I do.

851
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:16,765
So, now that we're married...

852
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:23,021
I'm gonna share with you this joke I told
at the Gotham Awards.

853
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,235
David O. Russell, like I said,
is one of my favorite directors,

854
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:31,199
but infamously, shouted at Lily Tomlin

855
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,581
on the set of<i> I Heart Huckabees</i>
many years ago.

856
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:35,539
You might've seen it on YouTube

857
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:37,999
because it was caught on tape,
it was put on YouTube.

858
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,750
It was seen by millions of people.

859
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,751
If you haven't seen it,
there is nothing I could do

860
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:47,634
to properly convey
just how extreme this rant was

861
00:57:47,714 --> 00:57:51,184
other than typing out a transcript
of what he said,

862
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,049
printing it out
and just reading it to you.

863
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,444
So, they were on the set of this movie.

864
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:05,904
They're in this classroom area,

865
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:10,243
and it's Dustin Hoffman, Lily Tomlin
and Jason Schwartzman.

866
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,450
And in between takes,
David O. Russell comes out

867
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,702
and he says to Lily Tomlin,
and I quote,

868
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:21,122
he says,
"I'm just trying to fucking help you!

869
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,496
You understand me?!

870
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:24,882
I'm just trying to be
a fucking collaborator!

871
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,340
I'm just trying to help you figure out
the fucking picture! Okay, bitch?!

872
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,222
I'm not here to be fucking yelled at!

873
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,128
I didn't work on this thing
for three fucking years

874
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,347
to have some fucking cunt yell at me
in front of the crew

875
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,259
when I'm trying to help you, bitch!"

876
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:54,656
So, I thought I should talk about that
on stage because--

877
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,833
because if comedy is tragedy plus time,

878
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,120
this is the funniest thing I've ever seen.

879
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,544
So, I said, "David O. Russell's here."

880
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,416
He's about where you are, about third row.

881
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,463
I said, "One of my favorite directors,

882
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,837
known for going to extremes
to get exactly what he wants.

883
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:16,215
The great director Elia Kazan once said,

884
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:19,013
'You do whatever it takes
to get the shot.'

885
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:21,982
David O. Russell once said,

886
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,404
'I'm just trying to fucking help you,
you understand me?

887
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,230
I'm just being a fucking collaborator.

888
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,895
I'm just trying to help you figure out
the fucking picture. Okay, bitch?

889
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,324
I'm not here to be fucking yelled at.

890
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,202
I didn't work on this thing
for three fucking years

891
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:36,569
to have some fucking cunt yell at me
in front of the crew

892
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,366
when I'm trying to help you, bitch.'

893
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:43,001
Two great directors
basically saying the same thing."

894
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,129
The audience enjoyed it.

895
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,514
David O. Russell left.

896
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,426
Which was unfortunate timing

897
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:01,312
because he was just about
to receive the lifetime achievement award.

898
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:06,477
The woman who booked me came over
to my table and she said, "Mike,

899
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:11,571
David is very upset about your joke,
and I think he might leave.

900
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:13,570
Will you talk to him?"

901
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,610
And I said, "Absolutely."

902
01:00:17,656 --> 01:00:20,366
Because, worst-case scenario,
it goes terribly.

903
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,958
Best-case scenario,
he makes me the lead in his next film.

904
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,748
And so, I'm walking with this woman.

905
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:30,793
She says, "It's my fault.
I never should've let you tell that joke.

906
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,377
I should have screened your jokes."

907
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,342
And I felt so bad
because I wanted to be like,

908
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,382
"I never would've let you screen my jokes.

909
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,257
I would've sent you decoy jokes."

910
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:48,272
I'd never hand someone a piece of paper
with the word "cunt" written on it.

911
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,230
I wasn't raised that way.

912
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:58,993
<i>♪ Christ has died, Christ is risen ♪</i>

913
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:04,409
But instead, I was like,
"Yeah, maybe it's your fault. Who knows?"

914
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,504
And then...

915
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,458
we get to the men's room.
David O. Russell storms out to the exit.

916
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:12,542
She follows him, and I follow her.

917
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,127
He looks back at her and goes,
"Give your fucking award to someone else!"

918
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,224
And I was like, "Awesome.

919
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:22,433
This is like we're in the video."

920
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:29,811
I go back to my table and my wife says,
"Mo, what's going on?"

921
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,475
And I say, "Clo, it's a long story,
and it hasn't ended yet.

922
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,357
But we're not in Mouseachusetts anymore."

923
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,736
Sitting at our table was Jared Leto,
but I didn't know it was him

924
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,702
because he was preparing for his role
in<i> Dallas Buyers Club.</i>

925
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,913
And so he'd shaved his eyebrows,
and he hadn't eaten in weeks.

926
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:51,285
And he leans over and goes,
"I haven't eaten in 21 days.

927
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,923
And that joke made me laugh my ass off."

928
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:04,385
I said, "Thank you, strange skeleton man.

929
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:10,191
That means a lot to me 'cause I'm in a lot
of trouble right now."

930
01:02:12,354 --> 01:02:18,284
Amy Adams gets on stage to present
the award to David O. Russell, or not.

931
01:02:19,945 --> 01:02:23,195
She says,
"David is a wonderful collaborator."

932
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,411
Which is the exact language
from the video,

933
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,702
though she left out the "C" word,
which was smart.

934
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:33,384
And then David O. Russell got on stage,
and he gave a really wonderful speech.

935
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,338
He's got a lot of wisdom.
He sits down. The reporter said,

936
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,959
"David, what did you think
of Mike Birbiglia's joke?"

937
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:40,666
"Comedians are gonna make jokes about
what they're gonna make jokes about."

938
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:43,297
They came over to me. "Mike,
what did you think of David's reaction?"

939
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,135
I said, "Whatever he said is fine."

940
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:49,564
And an article came out
in <i>Variety</i> magazine that week

941
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:50,731
about the event,

942
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,559
and the opening line of the article read,

943
01:02:54,229 --> 01:02:55,399
and I quote...

944
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,397
"Before any winners were announced

945
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,154
at Monday's 22nd edition
of the Gotham Awards,

946
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,067
one thing became clear:

947
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:08,909
Mike Birbiglia will not be
in David O. Russell's next picture."

948
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:18,956
I'm the joke, later.

949
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:28,640
And I think that's fair.

950
01:03:30,098 --> 01:03:32,228
Because if David O. Russell
were here tonight,

951
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:36,059
he would say, "I was invited to that event
to be honored by my peers.

952
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:40,726
And then you, who I'd never heard of,
got on stage and recited verbatim

953
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,647
the most regrettable three minutes
of my life,

954
01:03:43,737 --> 01:03:45,607
and everybody laughed."

955
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,115
And I would say, "Excuse me, sir.
There's a show going on."

956
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,790
He'd be escorted out of the building.

957
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:58,997
That's his side of the story.

958
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,804
But I want you guys
to know my side of the story,

959
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:08,255
which is that I gave it a lot of thought
before telling that joke.

960
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:10,885
I ran it by comedian friends.
I ran it by my brother Joe,

961
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,682
who wrote "Christ Will Come at Ten."

962
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,025
I ran it by my wife the night before.

963
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:29,490
I said, "Clo, can I tell this joke
when I know he'll be right there,

964
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:33,584
and it will not go well for him at all?"

965
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:35,871
And Clo said,

966
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:39,165
"It depends on what you want
from the night.

967
01:04:41,169 --> 01:04:44,209
If you want to be successful
in show business,

968
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,802
you probably shouldn't tell the joke.

969
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,559
If you want to be true to yourself
as a comedian,

970
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,347
then tell the joke."

971
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,320
And I told it...

972
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,196
because I love jokes.

973
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:17,158
I really do. I love jokes.

974
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,579
Jokes are meaningful to me.

975
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:24,375
Tonight's show here with you guys
is meaningful to me.

976
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:29,088
And the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> incident in France
two years ago was meaningful to me

977
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,255
and to a lot of people.

978
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,853
After that incident,
I read about this peaceful rally in France

979
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,430
with almost four million people.

980
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:39,345
It was leaders of Israel and Palestine,
people of all religions,

981
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:40,806
and they were gathered behind the idea

982
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,645
that despite our differing jokes
and opinions,

983
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:46,441
civility is ultimately what matters.

984
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,236
And increasingly it matters more,

985
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:51,529
because now you can transmit images
and jokes and cartoons and videos

986
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,534
across the Earth in seconds.

987
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:57,366
So, people in Russia are our neighbors.
People in China are our neighbors.

988
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,754
People in Texas are our neighbors.

989
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:07,760
Which, to me, is most worrisome.

990
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:13,301
But it really does beg this question:

991
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,506
"What does it mean
to be a decent neighbor?"

992
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,601
I think part of it is just listening
to people

993
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,643
in the context
in which they intend their words.

994
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:24,687
You guys could leave here right now
and say, "Mike Birbiglia got on stage

995
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:28,782
and said Jesus was a Jewish socialist
who talks like Woody Allen.

996
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:33,072
Then he said, 'Nice tits, Betsy,'

997
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:35,664
which is sexist.

998
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,872
Then he said,
'Statler and Waldorf are gay,'

999
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,162
which is homophobic.

1000
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:44,921
Then he called his tongue his mouth penis,
which is offensive to mouths and penises.

1001
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:50,467
Then he made fun of that guy for saying
he was arrested by a woman cop.

1002
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:56,802
Then he said,

1003
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:59,718
<i>'♪ Christ has died, Christ is risen ♪'</i>

1004
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:02,687
which sounded phenomenal
but was also offensive.

1005
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:07,395
Then he told cat puns for an hour.

1006
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,652
Which I don't enjoy 'cause I'm humorless.

1007
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:19,285
Then he didn't tell one joke about Muslims
'cause he loves ISIS!

1008
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:26,501
Then he said, 'I'm just trying
to fucking help you, you cunt!'

1009
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,545
And then he left."

1010
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:41,473
And all of that's true.

1011
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:46,939
Which is why I'm cautious
when I tell jokes on stage,

1012
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,571
because anything
can be taken out of context.

1013
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,526
People's careers are taken down instantly,
and some people...

1014
01:07:54,696 --> 01:07:56,026
are killed.

1015
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,699
So, I'm putting this in your hands.

1016
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,159
You can choose to leave here
and quote me out of context,

1017
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,250
or you can choose not to.

1018
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,423
But I trust that you won't.

1019
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,335
Because we're neighbors.

1020
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,467
And whether you like it or not...

1021
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:21,560
we're married.

1022
