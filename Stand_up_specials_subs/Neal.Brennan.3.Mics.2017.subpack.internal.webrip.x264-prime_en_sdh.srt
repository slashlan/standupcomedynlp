[announcer]
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Neal Brennan.</i>

2
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:34,743
[cheers and applause]

3
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,756
Thank you.

4
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,509
Thank you.

5
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:55,347
I'm vegan,
but I'm a hypocrite about it.

6
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,017
Like, I wear leather and I eat meat.

7
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,853
[audience laughing]

8
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,069
The Internet is like
a <i>Choose Your Own Adventure </i>book,

9
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,780
except every adventure ends
with me masturbating.

10
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:18,787
The Little League World Series,
or, as pedophiles call it,

11
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,497
the World Series.

12
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,555
Good to be here.
We're shooting for Netflix.

13
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,681
Yeah.

14
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,101
Here's why I like Netflix,
because Netflix...

15
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,104
You get a rating on Netflix,
one through five,

16
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,942
but you know the person giving the rating
is a certain class of person

17
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,570
who can afford eight dollars a month.

18
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,991
Or at least knows someone
who can afford...

19
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,704
Yeah, whereas...

20
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,915
Which, a lot of these sites,
like YouTube,

21
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:07,419
you got people giving thumbs up,
thumbs down, that are just not qualified.

22
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,590
Because I was on YouTube...
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.

23
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,425
<i>♪ Dun-dun-dun-duh
Dun-dun-dun-duh ♪</i>

24
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,302
The most famous song of all time.

25
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:20,182
Ten thousand dislikes! On YouTube.
I'm not kidding.

26
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,018
That many people are, like,
"Your music stinks, bro!

27
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,562
And I know music...
I'm from Tampa.

28
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,813
Thumbs down!"

29
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,527
You guys seem young.
Who's under 25? A round of applause.

30
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,612
Under 25.

31
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,197
[cheering]

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,948
Yeah, you guys are dorks.

33
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,867
Let me explain why.

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,661
You're the first generation ever

35
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:45,624
to have fewer sexual partners
than their parents, you fucking dorks.

36
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,710
And your parents grew up
in the middle of AIDS

37
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,213
and were still, like,
"Fuck it, I can't be stopped."

38
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,802
You're dorks.
Your drug of choice was Adderall.

39
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,430
You know what that means?
You did drugs to get better at school.

40
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,766
You fucking dorks.

41
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:08,105
You're not having sex
because you're too busy online

42
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:09,981
trying to get likes.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,151
You know how your parents got likes?

44
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,487
By fucking people. Yeah.

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,632
They'd fuck somebody.
They'd be, like, "Do you like me?"

46
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,866
"Yeah, I like you."
"Great, I just got a like."

47
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,969
If they told someone about you,
and you had sex with that person,

48
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,246
that was a retweet.

49
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,627
If you're under 25, you're probably
in school or just got out of school.

50
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,963
Student loan debt is fucking awful.

51
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,149
How many people have student loan debt,
by a round of applause?

52
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,508
[cheers and applause]

53
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,678
That's so many people.
College makes me insane.

54
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,265
The fact that they charge
one price at one college

55
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,767
and another price at another college
is so dumb.

56
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,645
It's not like you're getting better facts,
you know?

57
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,107
It's not like a community college
history class, they're gonna be, like,

58
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,402
"Well, the Revolutionary War started
immediately after the Boston Tea Party.

59
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,285
At these prices, that's all the
information we're willing to give you."

60
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,618
Yeah, I was lucky enough
to have dropped out.

61
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,331
Because I realized early on
that these student loans

62
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,459
are basically small business loans,

63
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:12,252
and the business is you,

64
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,005
and you're maybe
not such a great business.

65
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,134
If they called them
small business loans,

66
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,386
no 18-year-old kid
would ever get the loan.

67
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,263
It's a bad idea for a business.

68
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,766
If you had to go to the bank,
to the small business desk,

69
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,684
and ask, "I'm gonna need $150,000."

70
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,495
They'd be, like,
"What's your business idea?"

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,981
"Here's the idea:
For the next four years,

72
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,066
I'm going to get black-out drunk.

73
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,653
But also...

74
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,533
I'm gonna get a degree in Sociology."

75
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,202
[cheers and applause]

76
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,874
They'd be, like,
"Get the fuck out of our bank."

77
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,711
You're, like, "I will, but I did have
a way to pay you guys back.

78
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:59,216
I was gonna give you $80 a month
for the next 240 years."

79
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:08,141
If you're under 25, you've grown up
in a world of constant scandal.

80
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:12,187
Because of the Internet and technology,
everything's out on the street now.

81
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,064
There's a new scandal
every three days.

82
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,608
I like the sports ones.
The last decade's been crazy.

83
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,236
Oscar Pistorius, Tiger Woods,
Donald Sterling.

84
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,864
The one that got me the most, though,
was Lance Armstrong.

85
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,659
Here's the thing: They've made
some good documentaries about him.

86
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,161
There's one on Netflix
called <i>Stop at Nothing.</i>

87
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,414
Going into the movie, I thought
what we all thought about Armstrong...

88
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,749
maybe he's a piece of garbage.

89
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,502
But now that I've seen the movie,
it's more complicated.

90
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,047
He won the Tour de France
seven times on drugs every time,

91
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,218
but because of that, he was able to raise
$100 million for cancer research.

92
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:48,223
Say what you want, but he figured out
a way to do drugs for charity.

93
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,268
Yeah.

94
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,397
That must have been
hard to resist, too.

95
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,067
If someone came to me:
"Neal, you can cure pediatric AIDS,

96
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,590
but you're gonna have to do
a ton of cocaine", I'd be, like...

97
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,780
"Let's help some kids, huh?

98
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,578
I'd be willing to do Molly as well,
if it helps just one child.

99
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,415
Actually, if it helps no children,
I will do Molly.

100
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,710
Fuck it, if it harms one child..."

101
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,758
Lance Armstrong was everywhere.
Now he's gone.

102
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,482
I was talking to my buddy. He was, like,
"We were hard on Armstrong

103
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,013
because we don't like cheaters."

104
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:32,183
I was, like, "No, because we don't give
a fuck about bicycling, that's why."

105
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,227
If he played a good sport,
he would've been fine.

106
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,688
Baseball and football players
cheat constantly.

107
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,899
In fact, up until a couple years ago,
if you were good at football,

108
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,319
you could do crime,
we were fine with it.

109
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,697
Michael Vick, Ray Lewis.
Ray Lewis tackled so many people,

110
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,408
we were finally, like,
"Ray, you get to murder one."

111
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,370
Because if we like you enough,

112
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,749
we will figure out a way
to justify whatever you did.

113
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,958
Like LeBron James.

114
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,836
At this point,
LeBron could stab an old lady in public.

115
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,756
Everybody would be,
"We all talk about stabbing old ladies;

116
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,091
LeBron had the guts to do it!"

117
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,303
Yeah.

118
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,015
"He's a leader, do you understand me?"

119
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,309
Michael Jordan could shoot up
a shopping mall.

120
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,520
Everybody would be, like,
"He's still got range from the outside."

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,947
There's a new NFL scandal from a player
three times a week.

122
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,574
Most famously was the Ray Rice one,

123
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,510
the guy who punched his girlfriend
in the elevator.

124
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,204
People are always surprised.
You can't be surprised.

125
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,664
Football players are violent.

126
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,459
First of all, their job, in and of itself,
is attempted murder.

127
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,961
Like, that's their job.

128
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,965
The football roster is two guys
that can catch, two that can throw,

129
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:47,300
kicker, punter, 40 murderers.

130
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,472
Whenever I read,
"Ray Rice punches girlfriend on elevator,"

131
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:57,352
all I see is, "Football player
does football at the wrong time."

132
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,280
It's their whole life. They get trained
from the time they're little kids.

133
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,258
"Go to practice. Do football.
Go to the game. Do football.

134
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,510
Be with your girlfriend. Do football."

135
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,661
"Shit. I wasn't supposed to do
football that time.

136
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,790
I was supposed to do elevator,
and I did football.

137
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,630
I better get her body out.
I don't want her mad at me.

138
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,010
Better get her flip-flop.
I'll never hear the end of that."

139
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,394
Went back for the flip-flop
because he cares.

140
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,566
A lot of these NFL guys get gun beef.
I'm not a big gun guy.

141
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,735
I was just in Colorado, a big gun state.

142
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,279
I go there with my girlfriend,
meet her father.

143
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,365
Her dad's into guns,
carries a concealed weapon at all times,

144
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,118
which makes sense,
because he is in real estate.

145
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,082
At a certain point, he pulls me aside
and he's showing me his guns,

146
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,960
and he finally goes, "Do you got a gun
at your place in L.A.

147
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,628
so you can protect my daughter?"

148
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:10,133
I was, like, "Do I have a gun in my place?
Dude, I don't even have an umbrella.

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,304
I can't protect your daughter
from a light drizzle...

150
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,059
let alone an armed intruder.
Your daughter's in real danger."

151
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,313
Concealed weapon is one thing
I don't feel I could pull off.

152
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,233
If I had a concealed weapon,
that's all I would think about all day.

153
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:30,612
I'd go to Whole Foods,
someone would cut me off, I'd be, like...

154
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,951
"Am I about to smoke
this motherfucker?

155
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,294
I'm pretty sure I'm about
to smoke this motherfucker.

156
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,380
Because otherwise, how will he learn...

157
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,760
about the 12-items-or-less line...

158
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,472
unless I fucking murder him?

159
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:05,522
Guess we gotta have guns to protect
ourselves from terror.

160
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,108
ISIS has struck
a few times in the States.

161
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,568
One was near here,
in San Bernardino, California.

162
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:13,321
What bugged me about that one,
the husband and wife team?

163
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,534
The woman came to the States and was able
to wait eight months before the attack.

164
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,161
I got to say,
I personally couldn't have pulled it off.

165
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:24,207
If ISIS sent me over here,
I'd fall in love with American culture

166
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,167
and then fuck the whole plan up,
you know?

167
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,962
They'd call me:
"You're gonna kill the infidel next week."

168
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,298
"Look, fellas,
<i>Game of Thrones </i>just started back up.

169
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,220
We wait a few months.

170
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,181
I'll gain weight, maybe bigger explosion.
I'll let you know."

171
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,852
They'd text me:
"Go to the park. Kill everyone."

172
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,770
I'd text back: "LOL!

173
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,898
I'm in the park now, chasing Pikachus."

174
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:58,533
ISIS has gone after a rock club in Paris
and a gay club in Orlando,

175
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,245
but you know what kind of club they
haven't gone after? A hip-hop club.

176
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,329
Yeah.

177
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:07,041
They realize it's not gonna go down
the way they want.

178
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,628
ISIS can try,
but you're gonna turn the news on

179
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,547
and see a reporter in the parking lot:

180
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,675
"The gunman reached into his jacket,
yelled <i>'Allahu Akbar,'</i>

181
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:19,387
and was immediately punched in the face
by a woman named Brianna...

182
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,685
who said, 'Not tonight, honey.
Tonight my birthday.'"

183
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,812
[cheers and applause]

184
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,120
So, I'm depressed,

185
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,456
and not the way
you normally hear that.

186
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,584
Like, "I'm so depressed.
Kobe retired."

187
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,171
I mean, I have clinical depression,
the mood disorder.

188
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,591
And I've had it
for as long as I can remember.

189
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,345
I don't know if you know about me,
but I'm the youngest of ten kids.

190
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,597
I don't know if you know much
about math,

191
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,682
or kids,

192
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,268
but ten kids is too many kids.

193
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,647
Also, my father was a violent alcoholic.

194
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,776
He didn't hit me that much,
but he used to terrorize my brothers.

195
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,695
My parents were old when I got here.
I'm the youngest.

196
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,239
So, they were in their forties
when I got here.

197
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,325
They were born in the 1930s.

198
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,786
They were from
the "We did the best we could" generation.

199
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:28,790
If you criticized their parenting,
they'd go, "We did the best we could."

200
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,875
I always felt,
"Really? That was the best?

201
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,962
So, Dad, you'd get drunk,
hit your kids, and think,

202
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,964
'Now, this is me at my best.'"

203
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,008
My father was also a narcissist.

204
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,970
So, the entire mood of the house
was dictated by him,

205
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,181
and all the attention went his way.

206
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,558
I think me and my brothers and sisters
realized early on

207
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,896
the best way to deal with him was to
minimize our feelings as much as possible

208
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,023
so as not to call attention to ourselves.

209
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,485
But you do that long enough,
and your feelings start to atrophy

210
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,029
to the point that you're incapable
of having them.

211
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:04,075
Two things I knew I could feel
were ego and adrenaline,

212
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,161
so I basically just set out
to achieve a bunch of shit

213
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:11,082
to give myself a surge of good feelings.

214
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:15,044
Like, I got into NYU film school,
which was a miracle at that time.

215
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,546
I did so bad on my SATs.

216
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:21,217
I ended up dropping out after six months,
but that was a huge rush of adrenaline.

217
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,430
Then I ended up at a comedy club...
not as a comedian, as a door guy,

218
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,849
taking tickets and barking
for people to get in.

219
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,686
But I also started giving
actual working comedians

220
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,187
little tags for their act.

221
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,565
"Hey, try saying this or try saying that."

222
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:41,446
And to see my jokes work onstage
was a huge burst for me.

223
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,533
Then I started getting real writing jobs.
"Real" is a big word, but...

224
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:49,370
I wrote for MTV's <i>Singled Out.</i>
You're welcome.

225
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,207
I wrote for <i>All That </i>on Nickelodeon.

226
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,500
Yeah, applaud.

227
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,710
[cheering]

228
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961
Yeah.

229
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,756
Then, when I was 23,
me and Dave Chappelle wrote <i>Half Baked,</i>

230
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,260
so, at this point, my system of keeping
myself afloat via accomplishments

231
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,970
was working beautifully...

232
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,014
until it stopped.

233
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,976
After <i>Half Baked, </i>I started writing
with a guy named Mike Schur.

234
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,689
And he and I had sold a pitch,
which should have made me feel great,

235
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:20,193
and I remember
hearing the news as I drove along,

236
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:24,197
and I heard the news on my cell phone,
and I just had tears coming down my face.

237
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,160
I was, like, "I guess my plan
of achievement isn't cutting it anymore."

238
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,831
So, I knew I had to go to a psychiatrist
and get antidepressants.

239
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,543
So, I did. And the antidepressants worked,
sort of.

240
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,213
They definitely raised the floor
on my mood,

241
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,548
but none of these pills are panaceas.

242
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,551
They just kind of lessened the symptoms.

243
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:48,846
Depression to me
has always felt like a virus

244
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,974
that attacks your brain
with negative thoughts.

245
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,310
The medication staved off
some of the thoughts,

246
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:58,648
but a lot of them would break through
and would leave a void in their wake.

247
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,026
Like, to say I have low self-esteem
is not true.

248
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,363
I have no self-esteem. I don't have
the architecture for good feelings.

249
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,032
You could give me a trophy,
it will slide right down.

250
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,868
I just don't have the shelving.

251
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,454
In fact, I used to have
to carry around an index card

252
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,748
of funny things I'd written
or said or directed

253
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,584
just to try to remind myself
that I was okay.

254
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,712
Depression feels like
you're wearing a weighted vest.

255
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:27,760
I always felt like I was at a disadvantage
mood- or energy-wise to my peers.

256
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:31,264
It was never life-threatening,
it was just life-dampening.

257
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:34,100
And the medication
could take weights out of the vest,

258
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,062
but I still came across
as either bored or cold or superior,

259
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,314
none of which I wanted
to come across as.

260
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,650
Although,
you know who always loved my attitude?

261
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,652
Black dudes. Always.

262
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,905
Yeah. They'd be, like,
"Neal, man, you don't give a fuck."

263
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,160
And I always wanted to say,
"That's because I'm sad."

264
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:01,002
I think black dudes appreciated
how openly sad I was,

265
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,713
because black dudes
aren't allowed to be sad in public.

266
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:06,883
The only way a black dude
can openly express sadness in public

267
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,759
is if he does it with a saxophone.

268
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,686
So, I think people with depression

269
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,731
have the reputation
for feeling sorry for themselves

270
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:25,193
or they fell into a bad mood
and were too lazy to get out of it.

271
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:29,238
But, believe me, I'm not lazy,
nor did I approach this lazily.

272
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:32,533
Like, I went to a psychiatrist
and a psychologist.

273
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,745
If you don't know the difference,
congrats for having a great life.

274
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:41,000
I became a vegan to feel better.
I quit smoking to feel better.

275
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,212
Every exercise plan there is,
I tried to feel better.

276
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:45,379
Meditation.

277
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,341
I went on a seven-day
silent meditation retreat.

278
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,427
Medication.
I've tried every medication they have.

279
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:55,264
They all have side effects,
whether it's weight gain,

280
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,642
weight loss, nausea, grogginess,

281
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,770
memory loss...
which, for my job, is not good...

282
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,148
and, worst of all, dick stuff.

283
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,112
So, I'd been on antidepressants
for 17 years,

284
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,324
and finally I was, like,
"I have to try something else."

285
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,410
So, I was so sick of the side effects,

286
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,746
I was like,
"I need to throw a Hail Mary."

287
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,456
Heard of this drug ketamine?

288
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,794
If you know what ketamine is,
it's a horse tranquilizer

289
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,337
that's also a party drug,

290
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,257
and they've started prescribing it
for depression.

291
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,801
I know it's legit
because I saw it on Reddit.

292
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,349
So, I found a doctor that prescribes it.
I went to his office.

293
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:43,020
And I can't explain to you
how normal this doctor's office was.

294
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:46,190
A bunch of other people
waiting for other doctors,

295
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,568
fill out the form, old magazines.

296
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,945
They call me back into his office,

297
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,573
put an I.V. in my arm,
drip ketamine into it,

298
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,909
and I tripped my fucking face off.

299
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,370
On a Tuesday afternoon
in a doctor's office,

300
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:06,085
immobile, out, music festival level,
not on this plane. Gone.

301
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,213
And it lasted about 45 minutes,
but the comedown was rough.

302
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:13,634
When I came out of it,
I felt like I just came out of surgery,

303
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,178
which makes sense
because it is an anesthetic.

304
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,930
So, I decided not to do it again.

305
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,891
Woke up the next day
and felt better than I'd felt in months.

306
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,227
I was, like,
"Fuck, I've got to do it again."

307
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,105
Did it five more times
in the next two weeks.

308
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:30,985
But long-term, the side effects
from ketamine were bad for me.

309
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,779
I got nauseous for months,
I was groggy for months.

310
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:37,074
Worse than that, my eyes burned
for four months straight.

311
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,659
It was crazy.

312
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,622
So, that didn't work, for me.
Then I heard about something called TMS.

313
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,916
TMS is short
for transcranial magnetic stimulation.

314
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,421
All right, so, looked it up online.
Go to a doctor's office,

315
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:54,300
and they put a contraption on your head,
looks like kind of a halo,

316
00:18:55,217 --> 00:19:00,181
and they basically shoot magnetic beams
into your brain,

317
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,016
about an inch deep into your brain,

318
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:07,229
to a certain area that stimulates growth
and can alleviate depression, allegedly.

319
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,607
I did that.
That lasts about a half an hour.

320
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,067
It just feels like tapping.

321
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,319
Just feels like kind
of a shitty woodpecker.

322
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,031
You're, like,
"Okay, let's wrap it up now."

323
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,661
And by the second treatment of that,
I felt great.

324
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,412
Something definitely lifted.

325
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:28,334
The depression's still with me,
but not nearly as bad as it was.

326
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:34,674
I ended up doing 45 half-hour sessions
of TMS, which is a lot.

327
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:36,425
And the reason I itemize it

328
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,720
is because when you have
any kind of mood disorder,

329
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,472
it's not provable to people.

330
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,643
All I have to show you is my work.
I had 45 half-hour sessions.

331
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,104
It's really aggravating
when you have a mood thing.

332
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,064
You can feel people's suspicion.

333
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,733
Imagine if you had a cold,
and people were, like,

334
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,278
"He doesn't really have that cold.
That stuffiness is a choice."

335
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,532
It's really frustrating.

336
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,285
It speaks to people's ignorance
about depression.

337
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,956
I'm in the Big Brothers program,

338
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,458
because I'm an angel that fell to earth.

339
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,798
No, I actually joined because I heard
volunteering releases endorphins,

340
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,299
which I gotta say... eh.

341
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,471
But the kid is great.

342
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,099
So, one day, nine-year-old kid,
we're hanging out.

343
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,519
He sees me take an antidepressant,
put it in my mouth.

344
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,645
He's, like, "What's that?"

345
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,107
I was, like, "An antidepressant.
I do it to make myself feel better...

346
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,445
and I've also shot ketamine
into my veins."

347
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,031
You know when you forget to lie?
You're, like, "Oh, here's everything."

348
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,869
"And I've shot magnetic pulses
into my head,

349
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,954
but only, like,
45 times for half an hour."

350
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:53,419
And he's looking at me,
and I can see his wheels are spinning.

351
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,588
When a nine-year-old
is ready to say something,

352
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:57,923
you're, like, "I have no idea
which way this is going.

353
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,426
I don't know if this is gonna be great
or crazy."

354
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,387
But he goes, "You do all that stuff
to try to feel better?"

355
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:08,559
I go, "Yeah."
And he goes, "So you're like a cucumber...

356
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,814
but you're trying to turn yourself
into a pickle."

357
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,030
I was like, "Yeah."

358
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,907
[cheers and applause]

359
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,635
Women love the movie <i>Pretty Woman,</i>
but they do not love it

360
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,971
when you bring your new prostitute
girlfriend to their birthday party.

361
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,772
Getting a neck tattoo
is people's way of saying,

362
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,816
"Yeah, minimum wage is fine for me."

363
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,951
One hundred percent of people who eat

364
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,787
in that dining section
of the grocery store are murderers.

365
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,758
If I were black, I would stand
in front of tanning salons all day

366
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,468
and laugh at the customers.

367
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,970
[cheers and applause]

368
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,029
I grew up Catholic. Anybody else?

369
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,406
[cheering]

370
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:47,950
Still doing it?

371
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:49,821
- [man in audience] No.
- No?

372
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,998
They never...
Being Catholic's like playing trombone.

373
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,376
After 12th grade, you're, like,
"I don't have to do that shit anymore."

374
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:07,136
The older I get, you know who I respect
more and more? Muslims.

375
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,781
What they believe feels foreign to us,
but they're committed to it.

376
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,158
They're, like, "God came to us
a couple of thousand years ago,

377
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,519
had some simple rules:
Pray five times a day, don't eat ham,

378
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:17,688
women gotta dress like ninjas.

379
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,986
Those are the rules.
Until we hear back,

380
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,696
we're sticking with those rules."

381
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:30,451
Whereas Catholicism will change whenever.
The new Pope is barely even Catholic.

382
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,663
He is. And he's trying to be,
like, a cool stepdad about shit.

383
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,085
"So, I understand drugs
are called 'Mollys' now? I get it."

384
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,175
I feel the Pope just makes shit up.

385
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,720
Last year they asked the Pope,
"Can pets get into heaven?"

386
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,014
And he thinks for a second, he goes...

387
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
"Yeah.

388
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,936
Fuck it, everybody gets a plus-one.
I just decided."

389
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,859
At one point, they asked the Pope,
"What do you think of gay marriage?"

390
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,278
The Pope goes,
"Who am I to judge gay people?"

391
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,613
Dude...

392
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,491
you're the Pope!

393
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:14,328
For the last thousand years, you've had
two jobs: One, judging gay people,

394
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,706
and two, covering up gay things
that your coworkers are doing.

395
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,216
Those are your jobs as the Pope.

396
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,219
That, and dressing
like an outer-space pimp...

397
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,265
with an unlimited budget.

398
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,854
He has red shoes and a clear car.
That's a pimp.

399
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,986
I hang out with a lot of black dudes.

400
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:51,156
White people are always, like,
"What's it like?"

401
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,701
We don't do anything crazy,
we just eat and talk.

402
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:55,452
I don't have to rap.

403
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,266
Here's the shitty part
about hanging with black dudes:

404
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,836
Guys try to out-tough each other
to see who had it worse growing up.

405
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,272
I try to compete with my black friends,
but they always beat me.

406
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:09,508
They'll be, like, "My fucking dad vanished
on my sixth birthday."

407
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,902
I'm, like, "I can relate to that,

408
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,722
because my mother would often disappear
into a good book."

409
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:23,272
Too close to call, am I right?

410
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,113
Let's play a game called
"Sounds Racist, Isn't Racist." Ready?

411
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:37,745
Such a horrible setup
for a white person to give.

412
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,665
No, here it is. "There have been
a lot of good slave movies lately."

413
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,836
Sounds racist.
I just enjoy them as movies.

414
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,589
You guys think I think
it's a documentary. I get it.

415
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,570
Here's what I've learned hanging out
with black dudes:

416
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,220
When a new slave movie comes out,

417
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,432
can't be your idea
as the white person to go see it.

418
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,520
Can't be, like,
"Have I got a movie for us. Follow me.

419
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,859
Hi, could I get 14 for <i>Django,</i> please?
Thank you."

420
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:15,199
Slavery is such a big deal.
It's such a big deal.

421
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,576
If I were black,
I'd talk about it constantly.

422
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,205
A lot of white people go, "Black people
talk about slavery too much as it is."

423
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,665
First of all,
if Italians went through slavery,

424
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,251
they'd never shut the fuck up about it,
you know that.

425
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,006
You know it.

426
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,675
And they'd all have some heroic story
of escape.

427
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,346
"Finally, my Uncle Fabrizio
was, like, 'Fuck this shit!'

428
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,473
And he punched the slave master.

429
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,559
And he walked from North Carolina
straight to Jersey."

430
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,769
All right.

431
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,233
I would talk about it constantly.

432
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,152
Constantly. If I were black
and waiting tables, I'd be, like,

433
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:54,571
"Here's your check.
And don't forget: Slavery."

434
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,620
If a cop said,
"Know why I pulled you over?"

435
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,664
I'd be, like,
"To apologize for slavery?"

436
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,217
Look, say what you want about cops,
that's an awful job.

437
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,096
Everything is their responsibility.
It's all your responsibility.

438
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,597
Traffic's your responsibility.

439
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:23,517
Burglary is your responsibility.
Murder is your responsibility.

440
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,495
We're, like, "Solve the murder."
They're, like, "Me?"

441
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,999
We're, like, "Yeah, you went
to high school. Solve the murder."

442
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,130
That's not even the worst part
about being a cop.

443
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,782
The worst part is that,
at any point during the day,

444
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:41,994
anyone you're talking to
might just break out running.

445
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,372
And you have to chase them
no matter what.

446
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,292
"God damn it, I thought we were
just talking about baseball."

447
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,504
I don't know what you do for work.
No way you're chasing people down,

448
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:55,716
like, "We're gonna have this meeting
whether you want to or not.

449
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,386
We signed out the conference room,
motherfucker."

450
00:28:02,848 --> 00:28:05,076
I don't think white people
have enough empathy for slavery.

451
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,268
Here's how I know that.

452
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:11,940
When all that Confederate flag stuff
was happening last year in South Carolina,

453
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,818
people in Boston and New York
were especially smug about it.

454
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:18,238
I was, like, "I'm sure slavery was legal
in the North at some point."

455
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:21,450
I went on Google to find out,
and I saw how cold white people are.

456
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,494
I typed in "Was slavery,"
and the autofill said,

457
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,788
"Really as bad as they say?"

458
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,710
Swear to God.

459
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,756
Yes. And to answer the question, yes,
it was as bad as they say.

460
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,883
How bad? Well, how about this:

461
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:42,137
Slaves used to break into song
just to get through it.

462
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:46,558
That's pretty bad.
I've been in some awful situations,

463
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,269
never came close
to singing about it once.

464
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,232
I've been at the airport,
boarding a Southwest flight

465
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,317
that's three and a half hours late.

466
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,654
All the restaurants are closed
because it's after eleven.

467
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,157
My phone's out of battery, but I've never
looked around and been, like...

468
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,118
[humming tune]

469
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:12,584
<i>♪ Jesus, save me ♪</i>

470
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,338
<i>♪ From boarding group C ♪</i>

471
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,974
I don't think people in the South
understand the Confederate flag.

472
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,268
People in the South on the same truck

473
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,246
will have the Confederate flag
and the American flag.

474
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,480
"Do you not follow history much?"

475
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:37,484
Having both flags on the same truck
is like a woman having two tattoos.

476
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,694
"What's this one for?"

477
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,547
She's, like, "This one is to commemorate
my love for my husband Steve."

478
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,614
"How about this one?"

479
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:47,119
"This one commemorates the time
I tried to escape from Steve.

480
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,547
But he caught me. Now we're making
the best of a bad situation."

481
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,845
White people have a hard time
communicating

482
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:08,307
with people that are non-white
on a corporate level, advertising level.

483
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,891
Like, marketing.

484
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:13,687
Like, the NBA has been trying
to get more Latino fans.

485
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,105
They were doing this thing...

486
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,774
it's so condescending...
where a couple of games a year,

487
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,444
they change the names of the teams
to Spanish names.

488
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,530
So, the Lakers become Los Lakers.

489
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:27,284
And the Heat become El Heat.
First of all, shouldn't it be <i>El Calor?</i>

490
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,161
They're, like, "Let's ease into this."

491
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:35,083
Sounds like a white dude's idea
for how to trick a Latino.

492
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,211
In his head, he's, like, "Hector,
want to go see the Heat play the Lakers?"

493
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:39,796
"No, thanks."

494
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,091
"Hey, Hector, would you like to see
El Heat play Los Lakers?"

495
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,511
Hector's gonna be, like,
"Ay-yi-yi! How do I see this game?"

496
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,897
I think I've figured out a way
to end racism, by the way.

497
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,941
Here's how we do it:
We just gotta end race.

498
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,862
From here on out, we're gonna have
nothing but mixed babies.

499
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:09,576
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Mixed people will end racism

500
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,828
because you can't hate...

501
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,082
what you don't know what they are.

502
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:23,215
We're too separate. Black, white,
Asian, Latin, Middle Eastern.

503
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,008
We gotta spend more time together,

504
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:28,470
and we gotta fuck our way out of racism.
Who's with me?

505
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,723
Yes. Yes.

506
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:36,728
It starts tonight,
and I'm calling dibs on Asians. Look...

507
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,816
I don't like this any more than you do,
believe me.

508
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,528
I'm saying no more black, no more white.

509
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,321
I'm talking about khaki.

510
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:52,327
Khaki-colored people
with Asian-yet-round eyes,

511
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,121
nappy yet flowing hair.

512
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,373
I want every man in America

513
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:00,585
to look like those LMFAO "party rockin'
in the house tonight" dudes.

514
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,090
And I want every woman
to look like Bruno Mars,

515
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,843
because she is a fine bitch.

516
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,344
[cheers and applause]

517
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:29,656
So, up until five years ago,
I'd never been in love before,

518
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,369
and then I met a woman,
and we fell in love, and it was great.

519
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,121
It was as good as advertised.

520
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:42,210
And then she broke up with me.
Yeah. And that was really painful.

521
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:45,297
That shit was as bad as advertised.
That shit hurt.

522
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,592
Then a few months passed.
I met another woman.

523
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,427
She and I started falling in love.

524
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,180
And I was, like,
"It's official: I'm a lover."

525
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,434
And then she broke up with me,
like that.

526
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:03,064
Yeah. That one destroyed me.
I was beside myself blubbering.

527
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:05,442
She and I were both in a 12-step program.

528
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:08,570
She basically said,
"You need to go to more 12-step meetings

529
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,865
and get some more recovery,
and maybe we can get back together."

530
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:13,700
So, I started going,

531
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,621
and came to the conclusion,
like, I shouldn't date her.

532
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:23,043
And the reason why
is because she's famous.

533
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,545
Like, in the 12-step program,

534
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:29,424
I had to do a lot of unflinching,
honest writing about myself,

535
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,385
and I came to the conclusion
that I'm a star-fucker.

536
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,347
Yeah. And I don't mean
I like to have sex with celebrities.

537
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,183
I mean, I know a lot of famous
people from work,

538
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,102
but certain ones I become friends with,

539
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:44,731
and I obsess about them
and worry if they're mad at me

540
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,067
and why they haven't texted me back
in an hour

541
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,196
or if they heard about that thing
I said about them three years ago.

542
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:56,034
Like, really childish, embarrassing shit.

543
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,328
I think I'm a star-fucker
for a few reasons.

544
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:01,081
Number one would be
the thing we already discussed,

545
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,458
which is ego and adrenaline.

546
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,877
Like, meeting Taylor Swift feels good.

547
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:08,588
That's why it's the prize
in radio contests.

548
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,635
Yeah, and if I met a famous person

549
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,804
and we were cool
and spent the day together,

550
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,223
and they liked me, that filled me up.

551
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,559
There's a movie
called <i>Devil's Advocate...</i>

552
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:23,311
which I'm betting you didn't think
I was gonna bring up...

553
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,857
where Al Pacino plays the devil.

554
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,820
This is where Al Pacino finally just said,
"I can't play people.

555
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,079
I can play archetypes or weather systems,
but I can't play people."

556
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:45,375
Al Pacino says to Keanu Reeves,

557
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,877
"I'm just warming my hands
off your fire."

558
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:48,962
That's how it felt.

559
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,506
I always felt I don't have
enough talent on my own.

560
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:55,969
I need to warm my hands off
of other people's talent, you know?

561
00:34:56,052 --> 00:35:00,056
And people go, "That's so lame of you.
I act totally normal around celebrities."

562
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,309
Stop it. No one acts normal
around celebrities.

563
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:04,603
Celebrities don't act normal
around celebrities.

564
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:07,814
Being near a celebrity
is like driving next to a cop.

565
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,400
You can pretend you're acting normal.

566
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,487
You're performing normalcy.

567
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,448
"Ten and two, officer.
What do you know?"

568
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,163
I also think I'm a star-fucker
for professional safety.

569
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,625
Like, if you Google me,
most of the things that come up

570
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,086
are things I've done with other people.
Especially Dave.

571
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,380
You want to talk
about professional safety.

572
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:37,469
There's no position safer than being
Dave Chappelle's comedy writing partner.

573
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,638
Being on a writing team with Dave

574
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,616
is like being on a basketball team
with Michael Jordan.

575
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,974
You just win more.

576
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,853
And don't get me wrong.
I am Scottie Pippen.

577
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,982
And not just because we have
the same facial structure.

578
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,029
So, I think the blubbering over the woman

579
00:35:56,112 --> 00:36:01,451
was the culmination of something
I started ten years earlier...

580
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:03,953
when <i>Chappelle's Show </i>ended.

581
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,140
By the way, if you don't know much
about <i>Chappelle's Show,</i>

582
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,876
it was a sketch show on Comedy Central.
Me and Dave Chappelle made it together.

583
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,962
We'd write it together, he'd star,
I'd direct a lot of it.

584
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,091
And imagine if you and your best friend

585
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,469
would have a conversation and go,
"We should do a sketch about this."

586
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:23,098
Then you'd make the sketch,
and it would be the most popular shit

587
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,518
week after week after week after week,
to the point that it was weird.

588
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,729
And then it was just over, like that.

589
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,274
When that happened, I realized,
"I gotta take better care of myself.

590
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,695
I gotta write for myself,
do stand-up for myself,

591
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:40,782
because I was basically
just hiding behind Dave.

592
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:46,413
So, that's what I've been doing.
But I might have fucked up.

593
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,416
Because I was popular
as a writer and director.

594
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,751
As a comedian,
I had to start from square one.

595
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:54,087
I went from getting nominated for an Emmy
for directing

596
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,588
to signing up for open mics,

597
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,341
which is not the way
you're supposed to do it.

598
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,427
A buddy of mine calls me Benjamin Button.

599
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,512
He says I'm doing my career backward.

600
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,561
What was I supposed to do?
That's what my gut told me to do.

601
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,398
My gut told me to write with Mike Schur,
then to write <i>Chappelle's Show,</i>

602
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,651
and then it told me to do stand-up.

603
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,737
You gotta follow your gut, right?

604
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:21,114
Here's the thing about guts, though.

605
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,451
They're wrong, like, 85% of the time.

606
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,997
We only acknowledge the times
they're right, but they're wrong 85%.

607
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,750
You just have to hope
they're not catastrophically wrong.

608
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:36,629
You can be in the middle
of a bad marriage, a bad relationship,

609
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,674
a bad business partnership,
and not even know it.

610
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:44,471
You can spend, like, a day,
a month, a year...

611
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,348
you can spend a decade
on the wrong thing,

612
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:51,144
and by the time you realize it,
it's too late.

613
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,105
That shit is breathtaking.

614
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,777
So, yeah, like, basically,
the way <i>Chappelle's Show </i>ended,

615
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,696
I was forced out of hiding.
I tried to hide behind the woman,

616
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,407
and she kind of forced me out of hiding.

617
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:09,621
Like, hiding kind of
comes naturally to me.

618
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,123
And there's part of me
that still loved to do it.

619
00:38:12,207 --> 00:38:17,128
I love to find someone to hide behind,
but this is the right thing to do.

620
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,839
Me doing stand-up by myself
is the right thing to do.

621
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,426
It's just more honest, you know?

622
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:27,055
I could find somebody to hide behind,
but that would just be...

623
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,058
fear and habit.

624
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,604
So, yeah, like, I can't hide.

625
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,107
Like, I want to hide.

626
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,611
I'm dying to hide.

627
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,408
But, win or lose, I can't.

628
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,079
[cheers and applause]

629
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,307
If we talk, and you have an accent,
when you walk away,

630
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,561
I will do a very disrespectful impression
of your accent.

631
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:20,275
If you're a restaurant
and you close at 9:00 p.m.,

632
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,069
you're a lunch place,
you bitch-ass motherfucker.

633
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,871
I believe that there is a God
and He hears our prayers

634
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,373
and most of the time is, like,
"Nah, fuck that."

635
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,217
When I orgasm, I yell out, "Worldstar."

636
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,095
[cheers and applause]

637
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,321
So, people in your twenties,
enjoy your twenties.

638
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,615
It's great. You're so far from death.

639
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,784
But dating in your twenties
is the best part.

640
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,703
You don't know who you are,

641
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,123
so you think anyone
would be a good match for you.

642
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,958
You end up saying, "You know what?

643
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,170
Maybe I'm supposed to be with
someone who's bipolar. I don't know.

644
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,174
I don't care that she burnt my stuff
and punched my dog in the face.

645
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,926
She's Latina. They're fiery."

646
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,682
Yeah, in your twenties,
you don't know anything,

647
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:38,519
and then, in your thirties,
women, you start to get smarter.

648
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,104
Men kind of stay dumb.

649
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,441
Women, here's something men
don't realize about you.

650
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,444
Fellas, every woman in here is settling.

651
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:50,406
Yeah. They're all settling.
Because girls have huge egos.

652
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,743
Women think they have a shot
with every guy on earth.

653
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,246
Women will be, like, "If I meet
Ryan Gosling and I wear my blue dress..."

654
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,331
[giggles]

655
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,421
Trust, trust.

656
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,884
So, women have these big egos.

657
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,345
You have this guy in mind
you think you deserve,

658
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,347
but you get lonely and have to settle.

659
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,975
Women will be, like,
"I want a guy who's tall, broad shoulders,

660
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:20,395
and I want him to be cute, rich,
thoughtful, romantic."

661
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,564
And then the world's, like,
"How about five-seven, broke,

662
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,274
super into college football."

663
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,360
Girls are, like, "That's fine.

664
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,659
Is he on his way now?
I can't eat alone again.

665
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,285
I literally cannot eat alone."

666
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:45,670
Yeah, my girl is Asian.
Look, guys, I walk the walk.

667
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,754
And...

668
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,593
My girl's Asian.
I've dated Asian girls before.

669
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,406
She doesn't like that. She's, like,
"You're just with me because I'm Asian?"

670
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,473
"Yeah, clearly,
that's part of your appeal."

671
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,059
She doesn't like that.
Here's the thing:

672
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:04,188
"You're not allowed to like women
for the reason you like them."

673
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,400
If your girl's got big boobs and says,
"What do you like about me?"

674
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,278
You can't say, "I like your big boobs."
You cannot say that.

675
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,407
You have to like her
for some little character reason.

676
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:18,161
Even though I've never heard a woman
describe another woman by her character.

677
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,264
I've never heard a woman be, like,
"You have to meet my friend Jill.

678
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,623
Twenty-eight, from Arizona,

679
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,333
brave.

680
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,841
You'll know her when she gets here
by her bravery.

681
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,384
You really can't miss her."

682
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,095
She's gonna come rappelling
down from the ceiling.

683
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,768
Those are all the little strikes
against women.

684
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:45,146
Strikes against women are little.
You have big egos or whatever.

685
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,566
The strikes against men are, like,
"Creep.

686
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,402
Just lecherous creep."

687
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,238
Like, we're sexually harassing
women on the street.

688
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:57,200
Did you see the video of the woman
who walked around New York,

689
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,077
got harassed the whole time?

690
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,764
Different dudes, like, "What's up, baby?
Where you going?" Ten hours straight.

691
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,415
She put the video online.
My female friends see it.

692
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:07,627
They're, like, "That's the bullshit
we deal with on a daily basis."

693
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,088
My guy friends, on the other hand,
were baffled.

694
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:14,008
"Wait a minute. When I see a hot girl now,
I'm not supposed to say anything?"

695
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,804
"Yeah, don't say anything."

696
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:22,767
"Then these girls better stop complaining
about not being able to find a good man."

697
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,145
As if good men
are out harassing women.

698
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,981
Like Bill Gates and George Clooney
are standing on the corner:

699
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:32,443
"Damn, Ma,
your titty game is bananas. Shit!

700
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,408
Butt cheeks on swole."

701
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,207
Yeah, that same guy was, like,

702
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,793
"A lot of those guys on that tape
were being nice."

703
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,963
Stop it. No, they weren't.
No guy yelling at a girl is being nice.

704
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,799
It's always sexual,
always about her boobs or her butt.

705
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,361
Never about her personality.
I've never seen a guy on the street:

706
00:43:57,385 --> 00:44:00,429
"Damn, baby, you look like
you got leadership skills. Shit!

707
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:06,310
You an active listener, Ma?
You an active listener?

708
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,025
Straight up, you seem punctual."

709
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,531
Also, I never know what guys think
is gonna happen.

710
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,324
Do you think you're discovering her?

711
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:24,495
You'll be, "Damn, baby, you fine as hell."
She'll, be, like, "Me?"

712
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,082
Plus, if she's hot,
she's been hot since she was, like, 12,

713
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,334
or whatever age
you think I should have said.

714
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,220
Yeah. Those are
the big strikes against men.

715
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:45,099
And women, you can be paranoid,
overly suspicious.

716
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,767
Every girlfriend I've ever had

717
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,562
is always looking for proof
that I don't really love her.

718
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,522
And you're bad detectives, too, women.

719
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:55,401
You read into things that are not there,
draw conclusions that make no sense.

720
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,863
One time, I took my girlfriend to dinner
to a fancy restaurant.

721
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:01,324
I forgot to pull the chair out for her
at the table.

722
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:03,868
She's, like,
"You're not ready to be a father." What?

723
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,247
She was right, but how'd she know?

724
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,879
Women, you think however we treat you
in one scenario,

725
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,256
that's how we'll
treat you in every scenario.

726
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,217
Because a couple of weeks ago,
I'm watching TV with my girl.

727
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:22,428
I absentmindedly get up,
go to the kitchen,

728
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,305
get some chips, come back, sit down.

729
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,850
As my butt hits the couch, I realize
I didn't ask if she wanted anything.

730
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:30,603
And I can feel
the nuclear reactor starting.

731
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,273
So, women, if you don't feel safe
or protected or thought of,

732
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:37,735
your brains go to the worst-case scenario
fucking immediately.

733
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,237
Like, the darkest place.
I go, "Why are you upset?"

734
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:43,950
She goes, "You didn't get me chips. What
are you gonna do when there's a fire?"

735
00:45:44,033 --> 00:45:45,034
A fire?

736
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,912
How did we get to a fire from here?

737
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:50,623
That's how dumb and weird
my girlfriend thinks I am.

738
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,126
I'm gonna be in a house fire...
hot flames and falling beams.

739
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,297
Be, like, "Oh, man, this is just like
that time I went to get chips!"

740
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,972
Yeah, so...

741
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:09,600
And then, back to men...
just gigantic creeps.

742
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,729
Women, you gotta understand,
it's not even really our fault.

743
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:17,525
It's testosterone.
It's a creepy hormone.

744
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:20,987
It's got nothing but bad ideas all day.
Women have estrogen.

745
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,782
The worst thing estrogen suggests is,
"Let's get some wine and go on Etsy."

746
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,866
Not that bad.

747
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:31,247
Whereas testosterone,
everything it wants is against the law.

748
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:35,751
It is like having a prison inmate
living inside you.

749
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:37,920
He's, like,
"Let's fucking do it, <i>ese!</i>"

750
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:41,007
You're, like, "Take it easy, man.
It's 7:30 in the morning."

751
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,510
"I don't give a fuck, bro.
I'll be doing dips till you're ready.

752
00:46:48,681 --> 00:46:49,849
All day, bro."

753
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:57,356
Yeah, men never say this,
and I'll say it right now:

754
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,109
Having testosterone is legitimately scary.

755
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,986
I hear horrifying stories
from my girlfriend.

756
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,031
You're at a grocery store,
some creepy dude will start following you.

757
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,158
That's scary, women.
What's also scary:

758
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,828
Being a guy standing in a grocery store,
having a woman walk past you,

759
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,372
and then your brain goes, "Follow her!"

760
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,670
"For how long?"
"Until further notice.

761
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,258
Say something romantic,
like 'her titty game bananas.'"

762
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:35,561
Being an adult man is basically
about controlling testosterone.

763
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,688
Marriage, especially.
The marriage vows are:

764
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:39,857
"Do you promise to love,
honor and cherish?"

765
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:42,276
It should be, "Do you promise
to not let your testosterone

766
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:43,986
try to fuck the babysitter?"

767
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,154
We're, like, "I do."

768
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:48,074
Meanwhile, testosterone's like,
"You can't promise that, bro.

769
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:52,453
I fuck babysitters.
Straight up, I fuck babysitters."

770
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,755
Gold-diggers. Let's talk about them.

771
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,091
They exist.

772
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,427
Not as much as you'd think.

773
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,137
Yeah, you know how I know?

774
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,349
I have a little bit of gold.

775
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,312
And there has not been as much digging
as I'd hoped.

776
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:25,111
I gotta say, men assume there's gonna be
a gold-digging system in place.

777
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:27,988
Everything we do is to impress women.

778
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,825
Every accomplishment by men
in history was to impress women.

779
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,701
Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb.

780
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,638
They were, like,
"This is gonna change the world."

781
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,081
He was thinking,
"And wait till these hos see it!"

782
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,338
You think girls want a rich guy.
They'd way rather have a cute guy.

783
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,590
In their heads,
they can make a cute guy rich,

784
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,914
but you can't make a rich guy cute.
I'll prove it to you.

785
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,679
Mark Zuckerberg.

786
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,265
That guy's got $65 billion in the bank,

787
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:57,268
but girls look at his face and go,
"Not enough."

788
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,273
If you gave girls the option
between Mark Zuckerberg at full strength

789
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,692
and, say, Channing Tatum,

790
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,278
with, like, a traumatic brain injury...

791
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:11,824
women would still be,
"I'll go with Channing.

792
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,326
I have flash cards.
I can nurse him back to health."

793
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,249
Because you're cute, women.

794
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,834
So we chase you around.

795
00:49:22,835 --> 00:49:25,129
You're cute,
with your heads and your bodies.

796
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,550
It's creepy to separate the two,
but they're both cute.

797
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,261
Women, your bodies are great,

798
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:35,014
but make no sense
from a design point of view.

799
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,599
They make no sense.

800
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,476
Big boobs, small waist,
wide hips, big butts,

801
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,312
then short legs, small feet.

802
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:46,442
If you told an architect to build a woman,
he'd be, like, "It's not safe!"

803
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:57,661
Meanwhile, testosterone would be, like,
"Build that shit, bro.

804
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,999
Fuckin' build that shit, bro."

805
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,255
My girl's a yoga instructor.

806
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,341
Every guy says the same thing.

807
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,344
"Yeah. Nice and flexible then, huh?"

808
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:16,805
Meanwhile, flexibility has never been
an issue in my entire dating life.

809
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,034
I've never once been sleeping with a girl
and been, like,

810
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,936
"You can only open your legs
120 degrees?

811
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:26,065
Clearly, you're not fucking
at my level, baby.

812
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,527
You need to warm them hammies up
and come back to me."

813
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:38,327
Guys say endlessly dumb shit about sex.

814
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,121
It's this constant drone
of dumb shit about sex.

815
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:44,708
Buddy of mine recently is, like,
"There's over 180 sexual positions."

816
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:49,088
Stop it. There's, like, five
sexual positions that we actually use.

817
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:52,341
I know there's more than five,
but it's like a Thai food restaurant.

818
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:56,262
There's a ton of shit on the menu,
but you just get Pad Thai every time.

819
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,535
Plus, the other positions are, like,
"put your foot in the toilet."

820
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,602
Why would I do that?

821
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,866
Let's go through them. There's missionary.
People shit on missionary.

822
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:11,819
Stop shitting on missionary.
That's a damn fine position.

823
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:14,989
It is solid, it is reliable,
it gets you where you need to go.

824
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,615
Missionary is basically...

825
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,578
Missionary is basically
the Honda Civic of fucking.

826
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,084
First in its class six years running.

827
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:32,256
There's reverse cowgirl, good for hitting
her G-spot, breaking your penis.

828
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:36,927
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

829
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:41,015
Stay close, stay close, stay close.

830
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,230
A position I like,
but it also creeps me out,

831
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:50,607
is where men are on top,
women are on the bottom,

832
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:54,611
and your legs are pushed far back
so your knees are touching your shoulders.

833
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,363
I call it the Samsonite.

834
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,949
It looks like we're trying
to stuff you in a suitcase.

835
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,285
"Get in that luggage!

836
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,163
I am putting you
in the overhead compartment!

837
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,790
I am a ventriloquist,
you are my puppet,

838
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:08,751
and we have another show
in 20 minutes!"

839
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,048
Good luck not thinking of me
next time you do that one.

840
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,098
What's the side one,
where you're facing the same way?

841
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,059
[grunting]

842
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,896
Spoons? Let's call this garbage.
This is a garbage-ass position.

843
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,484
"Why are we fucking
like we're underneath the bed?"

844
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:43,243
And then, finally, there's...
there's doggy style.

845
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,929
Here's something you might not know
about doggy style:

846
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:48,082
Sometimes we'll be back there
and your legs are too close together,

847
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,958
so you're too high for us.

848
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:53,837
We have to take your legs, pull them apart
and lower you like a tripod.

849
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:00,135
It's the only time in adult life
where you actually use geometry.

850
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,470
You're, like...

851
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,227
Isosceles.

852
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,979
[cheers and applause]

853
00:53:30,416 --> 00:53:32,543
So, back to my dad.

854
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,711
I almost couldn't get
a one-man show license,

855
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,005
unless I did a full monologue
about my dad.

856
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:42,928
Like I said, violent guy.

857
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,556
Abusive. Volcanic temper.

858
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:49,852
But he grew up
in a really tough background.

859
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:54,356
He was one of 13 kids
born in the heart of the Depression

860
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,400
to Irish immigrant parents.

861
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,236
His twin died
when he was six months old.

862
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:05,242
Apparently, his parents put
my dad up for adoption at some point.

863
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:09,371
They just openly... A couple just came
and took him for a test-drive,

864
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:11,373
and brought him back.

865
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,000
Like, that was the system.

866
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:18,046
Needless to say, he wasn't approaching
emotional things with a full cup.

867
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,758
I basically tried to stay away from him.
That was my M.O.

868
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,803
Like, I started work when I was 11,

869
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:29,558
and then moved to New York
when I was 17.

870
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:33,645
And we basically just got into a pattern

871
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:37,816
of me getting my hopes up
and him kind of letting me down.

872
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,319
No one wants a bad relationship
with their father.

873
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,155
He never understood,
I wanted a relationship with him,

874
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:49,620
so I would always try,
you know, despite his behavior.

875
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,539
Like, when <i>Half Baked </i>came out,
it wasn't well reviewed...

876
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,041
and I'd say correctly.

877
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:59,588
But my dad was such a narcissist
that he was mad at me somehow,

878
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,465
like I'd embarrassed him.

879
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:04,593
You know, famously,
Harry Truman, the president,

880
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,637
when he was sitting president,

881
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,139
his daughter did a play
and got a bad review,

882
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:15,562
and Truman wrote the reviewer a nasty note
threatening to fight him...

883
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,649
on White House stationery.

884
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,443
Yeah, like, that's the way
you're supposed to do it,

885
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:24,863
whereas my dad would have written,
"Read your review of Neal's movie.

886
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:25,989
Spot-on."

887
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:31,787
And when <i>Chappelle's Show</i> got popular,
he was interested again,

888
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,873
but I was, like, "I don't...
Man, come on. Take a walk.

889
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:38,835
I don't need you when things go well,
I need you all the time."

890
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:41,255
Then he started to get sick,

891
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:45,467
and everyone I knew that had
had an ill parent was, like,

892
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:49,429
"You gotta make it right with him.
If you don't, you're gonna regret it."

893
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:51,348
So, I was like, "Okay."

894
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,434
I took it to heart,
and I wrote him a long note,

895
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,354
and I expressed all the things
I was grateful to him for,

896
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,107
and all the things
that I was angry at him about,

897
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,109
and sent it his way.

898
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:07,489
And didn't hear back for nine months,

899
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:09,908
and then I got a voice mail

900
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:13,662
where he goes, "Neal, it's your dad.
I never check that e-mail address,

901
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,582
and I just checked it,
and I gotta say, I read your note.

902
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:17,874
Pretty fair."

903
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,376
I was like, "Okay, cool.

904
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:22,879
So, he's gonna take responsibility
for his behavior.

905
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,424
That's great. This could really help."

906
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,342
So, we started talking.

907
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:31,138
And we actually got along really well.
Like, we had rapport.

908
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:35,225
We'd read the same books
and felt the same way about things,

909
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:38,395
and I was definitely his son.
It was cool.

910
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,981
Then his health took a turn for the worse,

911
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,526
and my sister was, like,
"You should really come to Chicago

912
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:47,070
and say good-bye, potentially."

913
00:56:47,154 --> 00:56:50,782
So, I went to Chicago,
and I was hopeful, you know?

914
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:55,329
When you have a parent like that,
it really fractures the whole family.

915
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,039
So, I went there hopeful.

916
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,416
He's taking responsibility
for his behavior,

917
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,961
and hopefully we can all coalesce
around him.

918
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:06,840
So, I go to his hospital room,
and within five minutes of sitting there,

919
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,259
he's trying to get me
to trash two of my brothers.

920
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:12,304
I was, like, "Why did I think this guy
was gonna be any different?

921
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,306
This is just who he is."

922
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:17,893
And I spent the day with him that day,

923
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,812
and then I went back the next day
and the day after that,

924
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:25,567
and on the fourth day,
I got a phone call from my sister.

925
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:29,112
She goes, "Hey, Neal, did you tell Dad
you didn't want to be in his will?"

926
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,990
I was, like, "Let me guess...
I'm not in it?"

927
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:34,868
She's, like, "You're not in it,
but he wants to change it.

928
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,453
Come talk to him about it."

929
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,790
So, I go down there and I talk to him,
and he goes,

930
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:44,628
"Neal, do you remember telling me
to take my money and shove it up my ass?"

931
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,922
And I was, like,
"I remember the sentiment.

932
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,008
I don't think I would have said it
in such a hacky, 1970s way."

933
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,389
Basically, when he came around
during <i>Chappelle's Show,</i>

934
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,474
he was always lording money

935
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,977
over my brothers and sisters
and their kids,

936
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,604
and whether he was gonna
help them with school or not.

937
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,398
He was manipulative about it.

938
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,901
I was, like, "I'm not playing your game.
Stop with that money talk."

939
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,611
And he took it to heart...

940
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:12,114
and wrote me out of his will.

941
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:17,911
And we sat in his hospital room
in silence.

942
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:20,914
And I could tell
he wanted me to grovel for it.

943
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:25,335
I finally said, "Dad, I'd rather
you put me in your will than not.

944
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,422
Just... I don't want to have to beg."

945
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:33,427
And he fell asleep. He didn't answer.

946
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:36,722
And... I had to leave town.

947
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:40,976
I had a job to do in New York,
that I had to go to for, like, three days.

948
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,728
I was gonna try to make it back,

949
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:45,188
but it was that hard,
end-of-life thing for someone

950
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,357
where I don't know
if I'm gonna make it back.

951
00:58:47,441 --> 00:58:50,152
Or if I should just quit.

952
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,445
I didn't know what to do.

953
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,530
"All right,
I'll just try to make it back."

954
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,659
But I knew this might be the last time
I would see him, so...

955
00:58:57,743 --> 00:59:00,162
it was hard to know how to be...

956
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,791
affectionate with a guy I hadn't been
affectionate with in 30 years,

957
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:08,295
so... I just, like,

958
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,798
kissed my hand
and put it on his forehead

959
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:16,470
and just, like, empathized
with a dying man, you know?

960
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,473
And on my way out, I saw my sister.

961
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,559
She's, like, "Just so you know,
he wants to put you in the will.

962
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:25,562
There's a lawyer coming tomorrow.
It's gonna be taken care of."

963
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:27,064
I was, like, "Okay, cool."

964
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:32,486
So, I went to New York,
and two days later, he died,

965
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,531
so I didn't get to see him again.

966
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:42,287
The funeral was gonna be the next week,
and I didn't want to go,

967
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,915
because, like I said,
the family doesn't all get along,

968
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,042
and I felt I had done the difficult part.

969
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,378
I'd gone to my father's deathbed
and tried to make it right with him.

970
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:54,132
I didn't want to participate
in the theater of a funeral.

971
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,844
But, through various levers of guilt,
I ended up going.

972
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,805
It was tense and awkward.

973
00:59:59,888 --> 01:00:03,350
I stayed for a while, and then left town.

974
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,938
And the next week, I got an e-mail

975
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:09,856
on my phone,

976
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,275
and it said,
"The will of Daniel J. Brennan."

977
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,069
I was, like, "I guess I'll open it."

978
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,655
Which, by the way,
isn't in the commercials.

979
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:20,075
It's not like, "Listen to music.
Take selfies. Open wills."

980
01:00:21,243 --> 01:00:23,870
So, I opened it on the street
in New York,

981
01:00:23,954 --> 01:00:29,501
and I'm scrolling down, and it says, like,
"My son Joe gets one-tenth.

982
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:31,461
My daughter Sheila gets one-tenth."

983
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,755
Then it got to me...

984
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,175
and it said,

985
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:39,469
"My son Neal gets nothing."

986
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,307
Which still hurts, you know.

987
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,894
I know you're thinking, "Didn't you
just say you got a little bit of gold?"

988
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:49,229
It wasn't about that.

989
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,065
If my dad was giving out blankets,
I would have wanted a blanket.

990
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:56,194
Just felt like a little flick
to the back of the ear.

991
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:59,406
"This is what your relationship
with me was like,

992
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,241
and now it's over,

993
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:03,160
and there's nothing you can do."

994
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,498
There's a silver lining to it.

995
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:14,045
You've got to squint to see it,
but I guess I choose to squint.

996
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:18,091
When things had thawed
between my father and I...

997
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,094
I was talking to him one day and I go,

998
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:23,930
"Dad, I feel like you didn't love us."

999
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:27,267
And he's, like,
"Yeah, you're right, I didn't."

1000
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,564
Which is a horrible thing to hear,
but it also felt good.

1001
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,317
Because my whole life,
I felt like I was insane.

1002
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,944
I'd say to people,
"I don't think my dad loves me."

1003
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,505
They'd be, like,
"Of course your dad loves you."

1004
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,282
I'd be, like, "No, I'm pretty sure
my dad doesn't love me."

1005
01:01:43,325 --> 01:01:48,121
So, for him to just say it, point-blank,
"I didn't love you,"

1006
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:53,418
was both excruciating and liberating.

1007
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,046
Because it meant...

1008
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,549
I wasn't crazy.

1009
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,762
And I tried to tell my brothers
and sisters what he said,

1010
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:07,349
but a lot of them didn't believe me,
which I get.

1011
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,272
Who wants to think their dad
doesn't love them?

1012
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,813
The way I see it now...

1013
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:18,068
I feel like they all got money...

1014
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:22,572
but I got something I needed..

1015
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:28,203
which was... the truth.

1016
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,997
[cheers and applause]

1017
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:49,975
Thank you.

1018
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:59,609
Sometimes the world can feel
like a room that's filling up with water.

1019
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,405
And for me,
to be able to think of a joke

1020
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,573
is like an air bubble.

1021
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:07,117
[inhales]

1022
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:11,538
And I can take the oxygen I get
into my lungs

1023
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:13,331
and it can carry me forward.

1024
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:19,129
Things can be overwhelming
and scary and hurtful,

1025
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:23,049
but thankfully my brain
can descramble things...

1026
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,594
and form a joke.

1027
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,347
Like, just for one second,

1028
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,182
things slow down...

1029
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,394
and I can win.

1030
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:37,105
Like, I can beat life.

1031
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:40,150
It's the best.

1032
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,152
And it's so personal.

1033
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:44,321
And it's something I'm so grateful for.

1034
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,116
Jokes.

1035
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,912
I got one more. How about I do it
and we get out of here? Cool?

1036
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:54,164
[cheers and applause]

1037
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:05,425
I like how on cop cars,

1038
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,969
"To protect and serve" is in quotes,

1039
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:10,305
