This King Philip of Spain
was always shitting on us, man.

310
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,541
Always trying to prove we weren't human
and didn't have souls

311
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,043
so they could keep robbing us

322
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,333
This was the biggest theft
in all of history.

"Why can't I help Boo with her homework?"

I'm cool. I got it. I got it. Go, go."

338
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:17,192
So I wait for my wife to leave,
and then I coach my son

339
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,946
on my year-long project -
getting even with that goddamn bully.

"Buddy, honey, come on.
We're gonna practice.

and I step up to you.

No, you don't gotta be afraid.
We're just pretending. And I say to you,

'I come from a long line of Civil War...'
blah, blah, blah, whatever.

344
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:38,338
You say to him, 'It doesn't matter
because we were here first,

345
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:41,508
we jump-started America
even before Columbus,

346
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,677

347
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,264
"Buddy,  it's gonna shut the hell
outta that bully, okay?

348
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,599
All right? So we good? We good?"

349
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,186
"No, Dad. We didn't even go over
my history homework, Dad."

350
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,274
"All right, honey, my bad.
So what's the assignment?"

351
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:02,404
"Dad, I gotta do my project
 on heroes that I look up to."

352
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,700
"Dude, do it on some Latin heroes.
Come on, man. Come on, it's a great idea."

353
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,871
"We'll talk about it later ,
but you got your marching orders, right?

354
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:15,876
All right, so go play like a normal kid.
No, man. You got this. Go play, go, go."

355
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,047
And I thought my son
was gonna crush it in class,

356
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,175
but he goes to present on Columbus Day
in front of his class,

357
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,052
and he's all like, "Um...

358
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,888
I know we've got lots of Latin heroes.

359
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:31,641
I'm just working on getting their names
and dates right now,

360
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:37,773
but I do know for certain that Columbus
was a genocidal, pedophilic rapist."

361
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,737
So of course the bully corners my son
in the boys' bathroom.

362
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,533
He's like, "Shut up. Your project sucks.
Go back to your country, asswipe."

363
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:52,746
"Ow. Why don't you go back?
'Cause we were here first, stupid."

364
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,207
"Oh, yeah? Prove it, dickface."

365
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:59,461
"Ow. I will. I just got nothing
on the facts right now."

366
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,633
"Damn straight you ain't got nothing
'cause you're the kings of nothing.

367
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,219
Come here, King of Nothing,
'cause I'm gonna crown your ass.

368
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:11,556
Come here. What, are you gonna run?
Run home and kill yourself, little bitch."

369
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,646
So my poor little, broken man
comes home, and he's all like...

370
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,608
"Dad, you just make up
 all this shit, Dad."

371
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:25,237
"I'm never gonna believe you again."

372
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,322
And he runs into his room.

373
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:33,412
So... I put on my best dad hat.
I go to him and I says, "Buddy, honey,

374
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:37,457
I'm sorry but life is gonna
fuck you sometimes. it just is.

375

just keep changing positions

376
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,046
until it feels good somehow."

377
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,885
That didn't come out the way
I meant it to come out.

what I'm trying to say to you

380
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:01,064
is I made sure you grew up better than me
so you wouldn't have to experience this.

381
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:04,025
But in the streets,
you can't let nobody punk you, man,

391
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,731
But I do. Hell, yeah.
And as my father once said,

392
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,858
and I wrote it down because...

393
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,153
he never said anything else to me again.
I was afraid I'd forget.

394
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,363
Here, let me...

"Every man has to measure himself
in life.

And how do you measure a man's... value?

By when he's tested in battle." So, yo...

398
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,713
I was gonna go to war on my son's behalf

399
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,883
and get him real facts
on real Latin war heroes.

400
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:15,055
So behind his back, I get a copy
of his eighth-grade history textbook.

That is...

because, yo, this book
opened up the world to me, man.

412
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,388
Because even in the first chapter,

413
00:25:56,471 --> 00:26:00,600
he proves that our contributions
were even bigger than what I thought.

[normal voice] Now, the Taínos
were the gentlest people

that the universe has ever seen

458
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:58,653
because they would also
fight their wars with wooden swords

so as to not kill their enemy. Aw...

Time-out. Historic footnote time.

462
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:13,793
Let's clarify some big-ass misconceptions
about Columbus, okay?

463
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:18,506
One - he never set foot in America.
Just here.

464
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,511
Two - he was sent by the Spanish,
but he was actually I-talian.

465
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:27,140
And three -
when he first encounters the Taínos,

466
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,935
he says to them
in his own inimitable words,

467
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,482
"Hey, you big brown mook, come here.
[speaks Italian] Yeah, you, come here.

We're gonna give you these broken mirrors,
and then we're gonna rape you.

472
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:52,665
We got grapes for you. Forget about it.
Who said that? Hey, forget about it. Hey.

473
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,334
Hey, forget about it."

474
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:59,297
Columbus was the Donald Trump
of the New World, y'all.

"Say what you wanna say about me,
but that motherfucker's crazy."

478
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:20,360
Because Columbus
basically did a home invasion, man.

479
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,613
And on top of that, on top of that,

480
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,658
he gave them syph-i-lis.

481
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,910
I gotta write that shit down.

482

I don't really wanna know,
but he's right - from fucking sheep.

490
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,753
Not "fucking" sheep. From fucking sheep.

491
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,508
I mean, I like lamb, too,
but I know where to draw the line.

492
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,429
But not these Europeans.
They'd be like, "Oh, Fluffy."

493
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,725
[Norwegian accent] "Your eyes
are so pretty. You're so fluffy."

Oh, I loves you. I loves you.

Baa-aa-aa-aa-aa.

497
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,869
All right, let's recap.

498
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,625
So Columbus brings syphilis
to the New World

499
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:02,003
by raping nine-year-old Taíno girls,

500
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:05,590
and then enslaves all the Taínos
until he exterminates them.

501
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:10,929
And that, my lovely morons,
is called the Caribbean Holocaust.

502
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:15,683
And that is the end of the Taínos
and their time on Earth.

503
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,353
Then what do we do?
What do we do?

504
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:22,398
We give Columbus a day to celebrate him
for fucking people over.

505
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,900
What were we thinking?

506
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,153
"Yeah, let's celebrate anybody
who fucks people over.

507
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,282
Next week, why don't we have a holiday
for my ex-wife's divorce lawyer?"

508
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:45,088
And I couldn't stop, man. I couldn't stop
obsessing about these gentle Taínos.

509
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,257
I kept thinking they'd be so perfect
for my son's history project,

510
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,719
and for my son, 'cause my son
was this gentle little creature.

511
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:56,057
And so I present it to him, right?
And he's all like,

512
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,852
"Dad, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Dad,
but there's this girl I really like,

513
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,815
and she already thinks I'm a wuss 'cause
I keep getting bullied all the time,

514
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,943
so I can't really do my project
on wusses right now."

515
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,364
"Why don't you impress her
with some of the other facts I gave you?"

516
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,199
"Oh, yeah, Dad, that's a great idea.

517
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:16,327
I'll just tell her I come from
sheep-fuckers who had syphilis."

518
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:22,458
"Thanks, Dad, but that's why
I don't talk to you about this shit, Dad."

519
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:26,295
"Oh, come on, Buddy.
Man, come on. That's not fair, man.

520
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,173
You know you can talk to me
about anything, my little man.

521
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:32,802
You know what? I wanna prove it to you.
I'm gonna show you.

522
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,764
I'll show you that you could be a hero
to your little girly friend, okay, my man?

523
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,394
Because I've got a foolproof... hero test.

524
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:46,107
Because in my book, you just need
three things to be a hero, okay?

525
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,276
One - don't be a dick. Because heroes don't discriminate.

526
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:01,581
They sacrifice their lives
to help everyone irregardless, okay?

527
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:05,668
And two... don't be an a-hole.

528
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,632
'Cause heroes act up
when they're called upon

529
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,553
to stand up for something
or to take a knee against something.

530
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,597
[cheering and applause]

531
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,812
And three - don't be a pussy.
Because heroes never back down.

532
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:28,566
It looks something like this.
I'm a married man, so it's been a while.

533
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,777
I know it's got that little thingy
right there..."

534
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:40,703
"Buddy, honey, are you paying attention?
Are you pay-- Honey, this..."

535
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,413
"goes in here."

536
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,959
"And sometimes on your birthday, in here."

537
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:55,927
"All right? This is our sex talk, okay?
But don't tell your mom. Don't tell her."

538
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,060
Buddy. So let's put all our guys
through our hero filter.

539
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:07,105
Let's forget about the Taínos for now
because they were too gentle,

540
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,358
but what about using...
the mighty Aztec warriors?

541
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,902
Oh, come on, man, they were so badass,

542
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,531
with those things through their noses,
and they invented basketball and shit."

543
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,284
"But, Dad, as a virgin
I can't really support them

544
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,578
cause they woulda sacrificed me, too."

545
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,457
"What? Where the hell did you learn that?
In school?"

546
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:30,044
"No, Dad, no, I watched <i>Apocalypto</i>
the movie."

547
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,967
Oh, great. My son is learning our history
from Mel Gibson.

548
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,428
Holy fuck, how demented is that shit?

549
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:44,225
So, yo, I had to double down
and get it right for my son

550
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:49,355
and, luckily for me, I find my ammunition
in this mad, explicit book

551
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:52,024
by this Spanish friar, Sahagún,

552
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,903
who was writing at the time of the Aztecs
and spoke the actual...

553
00:35:56,070 --> 00:36:00,199
[speaks gibberish sounding language names]

554
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,788
All right, let me break it down for you.
So, Sahagún says

555
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:12,295
that in 1520, Spain sends Cortés
to colonize Mexico.

556
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:16,716
Now, back then, Mexico was called
the Aztec Empire.

557
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:20,678
And their capital city, Tenochtitlan,
was right here.

558
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,556
Oh, grow up. Now...

559
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,355
when the conquistadors first saw this
city, they said it looked like a dream.

560
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,233
because it was so beautiful
and pristine and white,

561
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:39,155
and it had 45 public buildings, temples,
marketplaces, aqueducts.

562
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:44,952
The city was surrounded by a giant lake,
so they were safe.

563
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,372
So how the fuck did we lose?

564
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,376
How could we fucking lose, man?

565
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,254
Well, the going Eurocentric narrative,

566
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,424
even in a progressive book
like <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>

567
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:03,512
is that we natives lost
because we were somehow inferior.

568
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:08,351
Because the Europeans allegedly had
superior weapons, genes, intellect,

569
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:11,229
agriculture, blah, blah, blah, blah.

570
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:16,442
Bullshit, because Eduardo Galeano
in <i>Open Veins,</i>

571
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,445
which should be
every Latin parent's bible, by the way,

572
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:24,200
proves that the only thing superior
that the Europeans really had

573
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,118
were their germs.

574
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,705
Because if the European colonizer

575
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:35,544
attacked before his germs took hold,
he always lost.

576
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:40,424
That's why Cortés didn't beat the Aztecs
the first time he attacked.

577
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:45,054
No, he had to wait a whole fucking year
till two thirds of the Aztec population

578
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,473
died from European smallpox.

579
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:52,728
The other factor that undid the Aztecs

580
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:57,608
was their infamous King Moctezuma,

581
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,402
who was polling very low...

582
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,739
so he colludes with Putin -
I mean, Cortés -

583
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:09,620
to set him up as
the ancient Aztec god Quetzalcoatl.

584
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,291
I'm not gonna even try to spell that.

585
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,585
'Cause if Moctezuma
could prove that Cortés was a god,

586
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:20,965
the Aztec people were sure he was there
to make the Aztecs great again.

587
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,343
I'm glad you're getting my meaning.

588
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,640
But Moctezuma got played by Cortés,

589
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:33,060
so we have a word in Spanish
for Moctezuma.

590
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,396
<i>Un pendejo.</i>

591
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,194
So, Moctezuma
goes up to Cortés and says,

592
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,821

00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:36,538
the fucking INS or the police
could decide you're a threat, and the next person
to be shot or deported could be you or me.

740
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,463
'Cause Latin life is cheap in America.

741
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,924
[applause]

742
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:55,182
I didn't know how to deal with that.
I did not know how to deal,

743
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,769
so I ran away, I ran away,
and my drug of choice - books.

744
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,980
And I find more ammunition,
more ammunition

745
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,359
in this incredible book
by the genius Charles Mann,

746
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:09,696
who wrote this beautiful , beautiful
love letter to us called <i>1491...</i>

747
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:14,826
wherein he says that in 1531,

748
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:17,788
11 years after the Aztec conquest,

749
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:22,209
Cortés hooks up his cousin, Pizarro,

750
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:25,003
and gets him a ship to lead an expedition

751
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:29,383
against the biggest empire on Earth -
the Inca.

752
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:35,055
Now, the Inca were three times bigger
than any empire of the time, man.

753
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:37,182
Bigger than the Ming dynasty,

754
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,184
bigger than Tsarist Russia.

755
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:43,855
So advanced that they pioneered
the concept of socialism before Karl Marx.

756
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:48,694
And they had a binary code that
predated computers. How about that shit?

757
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:53,073
Now, can anybody here tell me
what five countries<i> </i>in South America

758
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:55,909
made up the Incan Empire for extra credit?
Come on.

759
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:59,413
Let's start from the top.
Let's start from the top. Colombia,

760
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:02,541
Ecuador. Sir, if I'm going too fast
for you, I'll slow down.

761
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,629
Peru.

762
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,134
Bolivia.

763
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:20,892
And Chi...

764
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,894
le.

765
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:28,233
All right, let me contextualize you.

766
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:32,362
So douchebag Pizarro
had three things in his favor, man.

767
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:37,409
One - Cortés' playbook
outlining how to get Indian allies.

768
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:42,456
Two - his cousin's germ warfare

769
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:46,501
had made it all the way
from the Aztecs to the Incas

770
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:50,005
and killed half the population
because the Europeans

771
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:54,134
had declassified their diseases
as pre-existing conditions.

772
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:00,807
And thirdly, and most importantly,

773
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:04,144
the narcissism...

774
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,605
of small...

775
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,691
differences.

776
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:17,240
And my man Freud had explained that
phenomena beautifully, and he says,

777
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:22,829
[German accent] <i>"Ja,</i> people are naturally
jealous even of their brother-r-r-r-r

778
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,248
or their-r-r-r-r best friend

779
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:30,337
because people
have to feel superior-r-r-r-r,

780
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:35,884
<i>und </i>will look for the smallest minutiae
of differ-r-r-r-rence

781
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:40,305
to feel better-r-r-r-r than you,
the goddamn sons of bitches."

782
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,142
Yo, Freud knew his shit, huh, man?

783
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:48,814
Oh, hell, yeah, because even if
we were all the same people,

784
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,399
we would find some
stupid little fucked-up reason

785
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,110
to hate on each other, man.

786
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,072
And that's what happened here, man.
That's what happened here,

787
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:02,410
because the most hated enemy tribe
of the Inca were the Chanka.

788
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:05,580
Not to be confused with <i>la chancla.</i>

789
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,001
'Cause that's every Latin kid's
worst enemy.

790
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,089
I'm sorry, <i>chancla</i>
is Spanish for flip-flop.

791
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:16,049
Our moms beat us with it
when we were little.

792
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,426
[speaks Spanish]

793
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,307
So the flip-flops...

794
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:30,230
the most hated enemy tribe of the Inca,

795
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:33,024
link up with Pizarro,
and Pizarro says to them,

796
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:35,193
"Follow me.
Let's hide behind the blackboard.

797
00:52:37,487 --> 00:52:40,323
"All right, friar, you go convert
those savage Inca.

798
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,869
And if that fails,
we're gonna go to plan B."

799
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:47,914
And the friar Valverde
was like, "Plan B. Plan B.

800
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,958
What is plan B?"

801
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,460
"Spear them in the dick, of course."

802
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:56,548
"Shh. Hide, everybody."

803
00:52:56,631 --> 00:53:02,220
So the friar comes out to the town square
surrounded by 80,000 Incas.

804
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,101
[audience catcalls]

805
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,563
All jungle-ripped in leather Speedos.

806
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,566
Sexy as fuck.

807
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,362
And the friar goes up to Atahualpa,
the king of the Incas,

808
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:22,908
and he goes, "Atahualpa,
king of the Inca,

809
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:26,369
please, please take this Bible
and convert,

810
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,998
because the Catholic religion
is all-forgiving, soul-saving,

811
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,125
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

812
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:37,589
Our priests love children.
Spend a lot of time with them."

813
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:41,426
And Atahualpa, the king of the Incas,
throws the Bible down. Psst.

814
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,761
"Who is this motherfucker?"

815
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,973
"Okay, never mind, never mind.
Plan B. Plan B.

816
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,685
Spear him in the dick right about now
would be as good a time as any."

817
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:53,897
-And Pizarro comes out of hiding.
-[imitates horn call]

818
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,985
<i>"Atacan!"</i>

819
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,738
And with his huge legion
of Indian allies...

820
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,951
they ambush the Inca.

821
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:11,206
So Atahualpa, the king of the Incas,
tries to make a getaway on a litter.

822
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,541
A litter's some ancient
king-carrying fucking thing.

823
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:15,627
He's, "Run, motherfuckers, run."

824
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:21,007
"If you don't drop me, I'll get you
all the pussy you want in the afterlife."

825
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,928
And his attendants were like,
"We got you."

826
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:29,557
"I just need a few more hours to get in
the union so I can get my medical."

827
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,895
-But Pizarro cuts them off.
-[imitates horse neigh]

828
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,315
"Savage, your end is near.

"You kiss my brown ass.
I ain't putting nobody down.

Oh, jeez, he got me! Don't drop the king.
Don't drop the king.

832
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,994
Come at me, Pizarro.
I don't need my arm.

833
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,621
I'll kick the fuck outta you.
I'll kick the fuck outta you."

"Savage, I'm warning you.

"Hells to the no, bitch.
What you gonna do? Shit, what you gonna--

837

Oh, shit, he got me!

Oh, fuck! Don't drop the king.
Don't drop--

839
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,929
Come at me, Pizarro.
I'll bite the shit outta you. Come here."

840
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,394
"All right, savage. Last chance.

841
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,147
Put down your king,
or I'll slice your head off."

842
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,609
"What part of 'fuck, no'
do you seem not to understand?

843
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,864
Oh, shit, he got me!
Don't drop the king. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck."

844
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:38,835
Yo, those Incas had your back, bruh bruh.

845
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,088
They would not drop their man,
even if their life depended on it.

846
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,591
That's fucking loyalty, yo.

847
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,385
Why do you think <i>Monty Python</i>
stole that bit from them?

848
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,143
And that's how the Spaniards won.

849
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:03,693
This one really broke my heart,
because here was our history,

850
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:07,364
here was the foundation
of a brown race, of a Latin people,

851
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:11,785
with their own James Joyces
and Dostoevskys and Prousts,

852
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:16,456
who lived deep in the Latin past
where we authored mythology,

853
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:19,584
pioneered in math and astronomy,
excelled in sport,

854
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:21,836
built aqueducts and pyramids

855
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:27,592
that put us on the same level
as all other great civilizations.

856
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:33,264
But now...
now just completely obliterated.

857
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,143
So I didn't know how to deal with that.

858
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,063
I didn't know how I was gonna
face my son with that one.

859
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,484
And, uh... then I get a text from my wife.

860
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,947
"John, meet me
at the headmaster's office."

861
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:53,576
"Oh, shit." So, I get to the headmaster -
that's principal to y'all -

862
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:58,957
and he's all like, "John,
I just received an anonymous video

863
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,627
of your son
punching another student in the face."

864
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:05,630
"I'm sorry, but that can't be right
because you know what?

865
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,675
My son's actually the one being bullied."

866
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:13,763
"Well, John, the video suggests otherwise.
I don't know what's going on at home,

867
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:18,309
but your son's grades have taken
a terrible nosedive, as of late.

868
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:22,480
And he might not pass this semester.
But don't worry about it right now, John.

869
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:25,859
We're gonna revisit this
after his probation."

870
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:30,947
"Probation? What are you talking about?
You're putting my son on probation?

871
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,950
Come on, man. My son was obviously set up.

872
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,869
What are we talking about here?

873
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,371
Is this because the bully's family
paid for the library?

874
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,416
Is that what we're really talking about?
Why you gotta do me like that?

875
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,835
You know me, huh? You know me?
Huh? You know me?

876
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,671
Hey, hey, hey, get off me, man.

877
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,381
Get off me."

878
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:54,053
So I'm escorted out
of the headmaster's office...

879
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,558
and on the walk of shame home
with my wife and my son,

880
00:57:58,641 --> 00:58:00,685
I'm all like, "Honey, I'm sorry.

881
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:05,023
Come on, I lost my head.
Come on, I said I was sorry, didn't I?

882
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:08,109
Buddy, honey,
what the hell really happened, man?"

883
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:12,947
"Dad, the bully kept yelling and yelling,
'That's why nobody likes you.

884
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:17,452
Nobody likes you
 'cause your dad's a celebritard.'

885
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,954
So I punched him, Dad.

886
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,708
I punched him,
and that's when they filmed me, Dad."

887
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,710
"Oh, come on, Buddy. Come on, man.

888
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,922
You know better than that.
Honey, I didn't tell him to do that."

889
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,384
"But, Dad, I sucker-punched him
just like you told me."

890
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,140
"And what,
 now I don't pass your hero test?"

891
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:45,271
"Well, screw you and your stupid test!"

892
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,943
And my wife's all like...

893
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,702
"Oh, I hope you're happy, John."

894
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,332
"I hope you're happy."

895
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,754
"Encouraging this violent type of behavior
in my home."

896
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:12,549
"What's wrong with you?"

897
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,759
"And, Buddy, honey,

898
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:20,139
you don't owe anyone
any explanations for your flaws, okay?

899
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,433
Because nobody's born perfect.

900
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,229
So you tell that bully
that if he's gonna pick on you again,

901
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:31,651
he better damn well be perfect.
Otherwise, just let you be."

902
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:33,903
"Okay?"

903
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,156
"Let's go get you dinner.
John, we'll see you at home."

904
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,117
"What are you talking about?
 I wanna come, too."

905
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,412
"No, Dad, no.
You only make things worse, Dad."

906
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,666
So I was back in therapy...

907
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,756
"John, let's go a little deeper
into your subconscious.

908
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,427
We're gonna go-- We're gonna do
a little word-association exercise.

909
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,137
I'm gonna say a word or phrase,

910
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,806
you say the first thing
that comes into your mind."

911
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:02,890
"Titties."

912
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,892
[laughter]

913
01:00:06,394 --> 01:00:11,107
"Uh, no, John.
No, uh, we hadn't started yet, John."

914
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:16,195
"How about proper nouns?
Let's try proper nouns. Here we go again.

915
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,614
Uh, success."

916
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,241
"Oh, oh, oh, um, Mark Zuckerberg."

917
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,409
"Genius."

918
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:24,662
"That's a hard one, man.
That's a tough fucking-- um, Steve Jobs?"

919
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,249
-"Legend."
-"Uh, Billy Joel."

920
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,710
"But, John, what about Marc Anthony?"

921
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,297
[unenthused] "Yeah. Yeah."

922
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:37,342
"John, what about solo performers?"

923
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,219
"Dude, it's gotta be Spalding Gray.
He's the godfather."

924
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:43,890
"But, John, do you see
the pattern here, John?"

925
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,560
"Shit, Doc, you're right. You're right.
I'm brainwashed.

926
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:51,022
No, worse. I'm whitewashed.
I can't believe they got me, man."

927
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:55,234
"I can't believe they got me
in my own mind, in my deepest places.

928
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:58,029
They got me believing
white people are better than me.

929
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:01,282
Fuck. Where the fuck
did that shit come from?"

930
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,786
"John, other than history textbooks,
movies, television, and newspapers,

931
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:05,870
I really don't know."

932
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,334
"But, John, as a client of mine,
who shall remain nameless,

933
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,503
because, well, he's a political figure..."

934
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:18,633
"All right, let's say he ran for mayor,
and a dick pic was his undoing."

935
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:24,931
"Well, he tells me that there's this
conference in Texas on diversity.

936
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:29,519
Maybe you go give the Latino point of view
and reaffirm your Latino centralness."

937
01:01:29,602 --> 01:01:30,687
"Thank you, Doc.

938
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:35,149
But didn't you just violate
some doctor-patient confidentiality, man?

939
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,193
What do you say behind my back?"

940
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,154
"John, look at the time.
That's all the time we have for today."

941
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,660
"Same time next week? Oh, no, John.
I had an emergency next week,

942
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:49,455
and I had to give your spot
the following week to Anthony Weiner."

943
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,419
So...

944
01:01:56,379 --> 01:02:00,633
I leave my therapist's office, and
I sign up for this conference in Texas.

945
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:04,637
And I had a bad feeling about it.
Mostly because it was in Texas.

946
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:10,184
And the date comes,
and I fly myself all the way to Dallas,

947
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:14,647
and there I am, trying to stay away from
 the alcohol in the green room.

948
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,065
Thank you, I'll have another.

949
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,861
Mm. 'Cause I never drink, man.
I don't drink, no,

950
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,739
'cause I'm always afraid
that all the ghetto shit inside of me

951
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,199
is gonna come pouring out of me
one of these days.

952
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,871
You know what I'm talking about.
Thank you. I'll have a double.

953
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:36,169
But I was nervous as fuck,
and they call us... out on the stage,

954
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:40,006
and this moderator, this Texan guy,
just rips right into me.

955
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:43,718
He's like, "Ah, Mr. Liquidzamo."

956
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:49,265
"I'm intrigued by this niche history
of Latin America

957
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,017
you're telling us about,

958
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,772
but you're an outsider and a foreigner,

959
01:02:55,855 --> 01:03:01,152
and your comments are a direct attack
on American exceptionalism,

960
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:07,700
so I-I'm-I'm gonna have to agree with
Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina

961
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:13,456
when he says that Hispanics and blacks
are not traditional Americans."

962
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:15,833
And boom.

963
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,377
The alcohol hits me.

964
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:19,962
[cheering and applause]

965
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:26,552
"Niche history, motherfucker?"

966
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:31,641
"Exceptionalism, you honky-ass cracker?"

967
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:36,312
"You best, you best, uh,
back the fuck off...

968
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:40,691
with your jingoistical, xenophobic,

969
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:45,530
inaccurate bullshit, 'cause you seriously
talking out the side of your mouth,

970
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,865
you punk-ass bitch!"

971
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,666
Because the establishment
of these here United States

972
01:03:56,749 --> 01:03:58,793
was only made possible

973
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:03,965
through one of the most comprehensive
campaigns of ethnic cleansing

974
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,591
that the world has ever known.

975
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,928
Am I getting through to you now,
motherfucker? Do you know me?

976
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:11,097
Huh? You know me? You know me?"

977
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,895
Of course,
the Texas crowd was not like you.

978
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:23,776
Oh, no, yo. They turned on me, man.
They started booing the shit outta me.

979
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:28,531
But when I retold the story to my son,
I cleverly left out that booing part.

980
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:32,702
"Buddy, honey, promise me, man,
you're never gonna lose your shit,

981
01:04:32,785 --> 01:04:34,871
especially in a argument, my man.

982
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,789
Especially if you're a person of color,

983
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:42,211
because then nobody hears the content
of what you're trying to say. Okay?"

984
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:48,050
Because what I should have said,
calmly and-and coolly and collected

985
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:53,472
to Mr. Texas, to Mr. Moderator,
was, "Sir, I'm not an outsider, sir.

986
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,933
Sir, we are not foreigners. No, sir.

987
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,521
We are a vast network of tribes
that commingled,

988
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:04,817
co-habitated,
and freely migrated north, central,

989
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,403
south, Caribbean and Mexican Indians,

990
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,698
and we is all the same blood."

991
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,244
[cheering and applause]

992
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:17,914
Yo...

993
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:25,254
Yo, we were so interconnected, man,
that when I had my DNA done,

994
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:28,049
they couldn't tell me
which specific tribe I was from.

995
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:34,722
And when I got my results back,
all it said was "Native American."

996
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:35,973
[woman] Oh, yeah.

997
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:42,897
It also showed that I had a STD
in high school, but that's another story.

998
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,401
You didn't have an STD
back in high school?

999
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,946
What, you weren't popular?

1000
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:58,537
I haven't forgotten about you, either.

1001
01:06:01,207 --> 01:06:03,542
So, it was November by now,

1002
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,253
and it was Thanksgiving.
I'm waiting for the meal.

1003
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:10,132
I'm waiting, and then finally my poor wife
comes down, all meshuggana.

1004
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:14,303
And she's like, "John,
Buddy's not coming down.

1005
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:17,390
No, the bully turned the whole grade
on him, against him,

1006
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,518
and... I don't even know
what else to do anymore."

1007
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:24,855
"Well, let me go talk to him.
Maybe I'll have better luck. Who knows?"

1008
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,320
[pounds foot]

1009
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:35,116
"Hey, Buddy. Honey, what do you say
we go for a little walk?

1010
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,118
I wanna share something with you."

1011
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:41,163
"No, Dad. No, go away.
Just leave me alone, Dad.

1012
01:06:41,247 --> 01:06:44,709
I wish I were dead. Just leave me alone!"

1013
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:49,463
"Oh, honey. Buddy, look, man. I know
what you're going through, I really do."

1014
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,383
My daughter steps up, and she's like...

1015
01:06:54,301 --> 01:06:57,513
[whispers] "Dad, let me help.
Please let me help, Dad."

1016
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,725
"All right, go ahead."

1017
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:04,979
[taps foot]

1018
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:09,400
"Buddy? Did you know that Dad
got booed by all of Texas?"

1019
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,406
"Do you wanna see it?
I have it here on YouTube."

1020
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,996
"And, Buddy, you know what?

1021
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,833
If you really think of the bully
as sandpaper,

1022
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:29,003
sure, of course it's gonna
scratch you and hurt you,

1023
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:34,216
but in the end, he's gonna end up useless,
and you're gonna end up polished."

1024
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,972
[laughter]

1025
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,268
Wow. Wow.

1026
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,106
"Buddy, honey, you know what?
She's not wrong, man."

1027
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,193
"No, she's not wrong
because you know what?

1028
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:55,488
People... are gonna try to hurt us
with their words, man,

1029
01:07:55,571 --> 01:08:00,451
because some people are unhappy,
and unhappy people don't like themselves,

1030
01:08:00,534 --> 01:08:04,205
and they want everybody else
to feel as shitty as they do.

1031

You know what? Bet they don't have
the guts to admit this to themselves."

1032
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:14,548
"Dad, do you not like yourself
sometimes, too?"

1033
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:21,013
"Oh, honey. I only have the guts
to admit it to you."

1034
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,684
"What do you say we go down
for Thanksgiving together?

1035
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,355
We got a lot to be thankful for this year.
Open up the door for me, man."

1036
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:34,193
"Buddy, open the door, come on.
Come on, man. Come on, open the door."

1037
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,781
"I'm just curious,
where are we with the heroes project?"

1038
01:08:39,573 --> 01:08:43,494
"No, you're not gonna tell me? What do you
say we open up the history textbook,

1039
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,955
and you and I look up
what Horace Greeley said?

1040
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:48,666
Come on, man. That could be a lot of fun."

1041

"Can anybody here help me? Extra credit -
what did Horace Greeley say? Anybody.

-That's right, ma'am.

1043
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,635
That's right. Horace Greeley

1044
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,137
was the asshole...

1045
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:06,976
who said, "Go West, young man."
But he should've never said that shit.

1046
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,979
Because those
"real" illegal-alien pioneers

1047
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,939
wouldn't stop fucking coming here.

I'm talking about the D-list
of white folks, so no offense.

01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,027
The real OGs.

1050
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:20,990
Crooks, murderers and rapists,
all out of the jails of Europe. Even Alexander de Tocqueville,
my favorite French philosopher,

1051
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:31,292
from the 1800s, had to address Congress
about these fucking pioneers.

1052
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,127
And he says to them,

1053
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:37,047
[French accent]
"I don't know how you people do it."

Not even the Spanish are as good as you.

1056

And you like to do it so much.
How do you do it?"

I must've got to my son

"Dad, how could our Indian forefathers
have been so stupid, Dad?

How could they have not seen
that extermination coming, Dad?"

"Oh, Buddy, honey,
because it's been proven

1061
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:17,087
that it's historically impossible to see
this kind of annihilation coming, man.

1062
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:21,967
Because, Buddy,
even-even our Cherokee people

1063
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,970
were bushwhacked
by bloody Andrew Jackson."

So from now on, there gonna be

[imitates gun cylinder spinning]

I look more like Frederick Douglass
than I do Andrew Jackson.

1073
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,811
But I'd rather look like Freddy than Andy
any old-fucking-day.

1074
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:22,569
Especially after you learn
that those poor tribes

1075
01:11:22,653 --> 01:11:25,281
actually tried to live according to
those strict laws

1076
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:27,950
of Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act,

1077
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:30,536
which is so twisted and hypocritical, man,

1078
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,831
because Ben Franklin
and the Founding Fathers

1079
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:37,501
plagiarized
the Iroquois nation's constitution

1080
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,920
to create our Constitution

1081
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,423
because of the great freedoms
and independence

1082
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:45,759
it guaranteed to each individual state.

1083
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:51,015
And then they go and do it to us again
in the 1930s

1084
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:54,268
with the "Repatriation Act"

1085
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:58,230
where they blame Mexican-Americans
for taking jobs during the Depression.

1086
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,315
Sound familiar?

1087
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,484
So President Herbert Hoover

1088
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:07,698
"repatriates" 500,000 Latin people

1089
01:12:07,781 --> 01:12:09,783
that were born here.

1090
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,536
Those of us that didn't leave
were lynched.

1091
01:12:12,619 --> 01:12:15,998
And between 1830 and 1930,

1092
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,625
600 of us were lynched.

1093
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,173
And now...
they're doing it to us again, man,

01:12:24,256 --> 01:12:27,134
with all these anti-immigration policies.

1095
01:12:27,259 --> 01:12:30,304
Making us so afraid
of being pulled over and profiled

1096
01:12:30,387 --> 01:12:33,223
that we have to pretend
we can't even speak Spanish.

[gibberish]

Making us so afraid
of being deported and carted off

1099
01:12:48,655 --> 01:12:50,574
that we have to pretend to be white.

1100
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:53,619
We have to pretend
we can't even fucking dance.

"Officer, I always dance like
a frog in a blender.

Until they play some merengue or a <i>cumbia,</i>
then we're like, "Oh, shit.

Oh, fuck. No. Motherfucking shit.
No. Oh, shit.

That shit always gives us away.

Every fucking time, man.

1113
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:58,642
So...

1114
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:04,606
Andrew Jackson passes
his Indian Removal Act of 1830.

1115
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:07,234
So a third of the Cherokee people

1116
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:10,404
die that winter as they walk -
together now, everybody -

1117
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:13,615
the Trail of Tears.

1118
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,329
I know it's a terrible human atrocity,
but can you imagine the guilt trip

1119
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:21,665
those parents who survived
 the Trail of Tears

1120
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:22,958
could lay on their kids?

1121
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:26,462
"You wanna hear about hardship,
little Buffalo Dingleberry?"

1122
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:32,384
"I mean, compared to my childhood,
you don't know how fucking easy you have."

1123
01:14:33,594 --> 01:14:36,847
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm all about a guilt trip, man.

1124
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:40,809
It's the leverage I got left as a parent
 'cause my kids are bugging out

1125
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,353
'cause they want
another iTunes album, video game,

1126
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,147
another pair of ripped jeans.

1127
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:48,775
And my daughter's wigging,
going, "I hate my life. I hate my life.

1128
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,278
Why'd you bring me into
 this world I hate?"

1129
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:56,033
"Oh, you brat. You brat.
You don't know how easy you have it, man.

1130
01:14:56,116 --> 01:15:01,163
When I was a kid, there was no Internet.
We didn't have iPads or Spotify.

1131
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,123
You wanted to steal music?

1132
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:05,459
You had to walk to
 the goddamn record store

1133
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,669
and shoplift it yourself!"

1134
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:17,221
Or you had to wait around all day
to tape it off the radio.

1135
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:23,727
And the DJ usually talked over
the beginning of it

1136
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:26,396
and fucked it all up!

1137
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:33,195
And if you wanted to know
the lyrics to a song...

1138
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:35,239
oh, my fucking God.

1139
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,993
Jesus-fucking-Christ.
Oh, my God, you had to rewind it

1140
01:15:40,077 --> 01:15:43,539
and rewind it and rewind
and rewind and rewind.

1141
01:15:44,331 --> 01:15:47,960
That's why I never knew
that "Rock the Cat Box"

1142
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,838
"Rock the Cat Box" was actually

1143
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,466
"Rock the Casbah!"

1144
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:04,768
As you could see, I was losing my mind.

1145
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:07,729
Literally losing my mind.

1146
01:16:08,855 --> 01:16:11,233
I think it was because
it was months and months

1147
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,402
of learning about our losers history

1148
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:16,822
that I started suffering from
some kind of ancestral PTSD.

1149
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,282
I don't know what the fuck.

1150
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:21,118
But when I start taking it out on my kids,

1151
01:16:21,201 --> 01:16:25,998
that's when I draw the line in the sand,
man, and I was done. Yo, I was done.

1152
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:30,669
I waited for spring break to break it
to my son that I was quitting on him.

1153
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,006
I get to his room,
and I find him sitting in the dark,

1154
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:36,049
looking all lonely and sad and,

1155
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:39,553
"Hey, little man. I want you to know
I'm sorry I failed you, man.

1156
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:42,514
I'm sorry. I tried to protect you
from all this, and I...

1157
01:16:42,806 --> 01:16:47,019
-And, man, I just..."
-"Dad, don't worry.

1158
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:51,064
Don't worry, Dad, 'cause I realized
that a lot of the kids in my grade

1159
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:54,151
are just-just never gonna like me, Dad,

1160
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:58,572
but I also realized that
 I highly don't give a fuck."

1161
01:16:58,655 --> 01:17:00,991
[applause]

1162
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:08,373
"So, Dad, I'm gonna focus on
my heroes project

1163
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,792
so I could graduate
and get the hell outta this school

1164
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:15,172
but, Dad, Dad. Wait, Dad.
I wanna do my project on something

1165
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:19,343
-that no one has ever done, Dad."
-"All right, Buddy. All right, honey.

1166
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:22,012
It's gonna be our secret mission,
you and me, okay?

1167
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:27,976
Oh, shit, dude, I got it. Buddy,
I got the thing that no one's ever done.

1168
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:31,104
My God, this is gonna rock your world,
because you know what?

1169
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,439
It rocked my world.

1170
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:35,567
When I found out that we Latin people

1171
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:40,530
had participated in the Civil War, Buddy."

1172
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,701
"Tell that to the goddamn bully,
because 20,000 of us Latinos

1173
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,870
fought in the North and the South."

1174
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:49,414
We'll go wherever they pay us,
you know how we do.

1175
01:17:51,583 --> 01:17:54,002
Buddy, you're right.
Let's forget the Civil War.

1176
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:58,006
I'm gonna get you that Latin war hero
if it's the last thing I do.

1177
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,300
I wanna check my notes real fast.

1178
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:02,594
This is gonna blow your mind,
because you know what?

1179
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:06,306
It blew my mind when I found out
that we Latin people

1180
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:10,811
had helped out in the American Revolution.

1181
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:13,605
Ten thousand
unknown Latino patriots

1182
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,900
fought out of a total of
80,000 American troops.

1183
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:20,404
That's one out of eight.
And some of us were generals.

1184
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:25,575
And women, Cuban women in Virginia
sold their jewelry,

1185
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,744
their hoop earrings
and their door knockers..."

1186
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,623
"to feed the patriots.

1187
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:35,043
But the illest... Latin hero
I found for you

1188
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:39,423
was this General Bernardo Gálvez.

1189
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:40,507
And this homie

1190
01:18:40,590 --> 01:18:44,803
donated $70,000 worth of weapons
to George Washington.

1191
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:49,057
So, between the jewelry and the weapons,
we also financed that war.

1192
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:52,769
So we too are the sons and daughters
of the American Revolution, my man."

1193
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:55,230
[applause and cheering]

1194
01:18:58,024 --> 01:19:01,111
Out of nowhere my daughter pops out
and rips off her headphones,

1195
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:03,321
and she's like, "Seriously, Dad?"

1196
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,700
"Seriously?"

1197
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:11,371
"Like, 95% of what you've been
talking about is all military history.

1198
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:14,624
Only focused entirely around men, Dad.

1199
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:18,754
What a myopic and compromised,
gender-biased view of history, Dad.

1200
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:24,384
I can't believe you're such a sexist!
I can't believe I came out of you!"

1201
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:33,059
And she put on her headphones
and blasted some misogynistic rap song.

1202
01:19:36,730 --> 01:19:40,150
"Buddy, honey, I didn't realize
that I was being unconsciously sexist.

1203
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:42,778
Dude, I'm gonna
have to revisit all the research,

1204
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,071
but redo it
from a woman's point of view."

1205
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:48,533
"No, Dad, no. She's better off
without your help, Dad."

1206
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:53,413
"And, Dad, you keep throwing
all these random heroes at me, Dad.

1207
01:19:53,497 --> 01:19:55,373
All these war guys."

1208
01:19:55,457 --> 01:19:57,459
"Buddy, come on. Random heroes.

1209
01:19:57,626 --> 01:20:01,379
Don't you know that our history was
systematically cut out of history books?

1210
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:04,883
How come you don't know that
30,000 of us fought in World War I

1211
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:09,679
and almost 500,000 of us
sacrificed our lives in World War II?"

1212
01:20:09,763 --> 01:20:12,516
"Well, Dad, I don't care because to me,

1213
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:17,896
violence is just the worst kind
of communication, Dad. That's why--

1214
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,439
Look, I already got my project

1215
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:22,359
so please stay out of it
'cause I'm working on it."

1216
01:20:22,442 --> 01:20:25,862
"So you don't like warriors, dude.
I'm cool. That's no biggie, man.

1217
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,825
'Cause I got my secret stash here
that I been saving for you, my man.

1218
01:20:29,908 --> 01:20:32,369
This is my real jam. Political leaders.

1219
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:35,372
Simon Bolivar, the George Washington
of South America.

1220
01:20:35,455 --> 01:20:39,042
Or how about a civil-rights activist
like Cesar Chavez? Hey, come on."

1221
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:45,757
"Don't walk out on me, man. You know
how hard it is to find these heroes

1222
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:48,468
-who were spics and beaners to them?"
-[door slams]

1223
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,228
I guess he just didn't want my help
anymore.

1224
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:04,109
But now I had all this information
just stuck in my head, man,

1225
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,695
and it started playing
over and over and over.

1226
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:11,741
I started feeling like I was going insane.
And then I find out that

1227
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:16,705
one in four people in America
suffers from some form of mental illness.

1228
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:22,669
So think of your three best friends.
And if they're okay, well, then it's you.

1229
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:31,928
Latin stats roll call.
Latin stats roll call.

1230
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:35,390
So we Latin people are
the second-oldest ethnic group in America

1231
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:37,183
after Native Americans.

1232
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:40,520
And yet, at 22%, we have
the highest high-school dropout rate

1233
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:42,522
of any minority in this country.

1234
01:21:42,606 --> 01:21:47,110
And at 32%, we are the most-bullied
ethnic group in the workplace.

1235
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:51,865
And at 40% of the prison population,
because of this immigration detention,

1236
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:54,868
we are now
the largest ethnic group in jails.

1237
01:21:55,702 --> 01:21:58,038
And 60% of hate crimes
are perpetrated on us,

1238
01:21:58,121 --> 01:22:00,165
so we've got the record there, too.

1239
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:02,375
And we're almost 70 million

1240
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:06,296
hard-working,
contributing Americans in this country,

1241
01:22:06,379 --> 01:22:09,966
and this president
has effectively declared war on us

1242
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,261
by his zero tolerance,
by betraying our Dreamers,

1243
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:16,306
by publicly denigrating Mexican Americans

1244
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:21,978
and then by abandoning American citizens
in Puerto Rico and left to die.

1245
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:26,566
And how dare he. How dare he.

1246
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,986
When we're so American it hurts.

1247
01:22:31,571 --> 01:22:35,742
Because we're the only ethnic group
that has fought in every single war

1248
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:36,993
this country's ever had.

1249
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:43,416
We have shed blood for America
in each and every single one of her wars.

1250
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:46,461
We're the most decorated minority

1251
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:50,256
in each and every
single one of those wars.

1252
01:22:51,549 --> 01:22:53,885
But where are our contributions?

1253
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:56,680
Where are they? Where are they listed,
mentioned or honored?

1254
01:22:56,763 --> 01:23:01,559
Can you imagine, can you imagine
if they were put back into history?

1255
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:04,229
Written back into history textbooks?

1256
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:08,108
Can you imagine how America would see us?

1257
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,737
More importantly, can you imagine
how we would see ourselves?

1258
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,624
And then I just fell asleep.

1259
01:23:30,296 --> 01:23:33,675
I don't know how long I'd been asleep,
but it was a long time and...

1260
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,470
all I could think about is,
"God, is my son ever gonna graduate?"

1261
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:41,474
Oh, God. [mutters]

1262
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,774
[alarm sounds]

1263
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:52,027
Oh, shit. What happened? What? What?

1264
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:55,947
"John, wake up.  John, wake up.
It's Buddy's graduation,

1265
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:00,118
and, John, Buddy said he's gonna have
a big surprise for us.

1266
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:03,038
Everybody's waiting for you downstairs.
You're gonna make us late."

1267
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:06,499
"A surprise, honey? What surprise?
Why didn't anybody tell me?"

1268
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:08,877
So we race down to the auditorium

1269
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,963
for my son's graduation
from middle school.

1270
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,258
-["Pomp and Circumstance" playing]
-That's eighth grade to y'all.

1271
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,094
And my wife and I are so excited, man.

1272
01:24:18,178 --> 01:24:22,265
We're so excited because we never thought
this day was actually gonna come.

1273
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:27,187
And, um... I go to take my seat
and guess who bogarts it from me.

1274
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:28,730
The <i>come mierda</i> bully's dad.

1275
01:24:31,191 --> 01:24:33,276
"No, John, you don't get to sit down, no,

1276
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,821
because you were such a grandmother
and went crying to the headmaster.

1277
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:39,324
Now my son doesn't have a shot
at a good school.

1278
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,618
No, no, thanks a lot.
I really appreciate it.

1279
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:44,704
Glad I gave to the Financial Aid Fund
because you know what?

1280
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,915
It's really done me a world of good."

1281
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:50,710
"Excuse me, but it's good to know
you just give for your own benefit.

1282
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:54,255
And just so you know,
we're not on financial aid.

1283
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:56,758
Maybe because I'm Latin,
you assume we had to be,

1284
01:24:56,841 --> 01:25:00,553
like it's a rule or something? But, no,
my son got in 'cause he earned it."

1285
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:03,431
"Unlike some people's kids
who probably benefited from

1286
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:06,976
some white affirmative-action program
for lazy, privileged white kids,

1287
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:10,396
as if that demographic could ever
really be underrepresented, huh?"

1288
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,900
"Hey, you wanna step outside?

1289
01:25:13,983 --> 01:25:16,694
You-You-You wanna step outside?"

1290
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:20,990
"Look, there is nothing I would love more
than to mambo all over your face..."

1291
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,662
"but I'm gonna have to
deny myself that pleasure

1292
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:31,167
because as a wise Puerto Rican, Colombian,
Jewish, Incan, Aztec kid once told me,

1293
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,921
violence is the lowest form
of communication."

1294
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,515
And bam - I had my comeback.

1295
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:48,601
I was the father I wanted my son to have.

1296
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:51,980
My wife just elbows the shit outta me.

1297
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:55,942
"John, shh! Would you be quiet.
Buddy's about to talk."

1298
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,611
And then at that exact moment,

1299
01:25:58,695 --> 01:26:03,032
I hear them call my son's name out loud.
This was the moment, man.

1300
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:05,743
This is the moment I've been dreading
 my whole life.

1301
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:08,329
I couldn't go up there with him anymore.

1302
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,499
I couldn't help him, I couldn't fix it
for him, I couldn't save him,

1303
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,626
I just... I just had to let go.

1304
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:18,590
"John, shh. Would you be quiet.
Not everything is about you, John."

1305
01:26:20,216 --> 01:26:21,176
"Okay, okay."

1306
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:25,388
I see my son approaching the podium,
and I couldn't believe it.

1307
01:26:25,471 --> 01:26:28,183
I couldn't believe that was my boy.
"Who was this kid?

1308
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:31,978
Who was this amazing young man
walking towards the podium?"

1309
01:26:40,737 --> 01:26:43,489
"Um... at the first,
when the headmaster asked me

1310
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:46,784
to take my hero project
and turn it into this speech,

1311
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:49,704
I really wasn't prepared but, um...

1312
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:53,082
then something in the last few weeks
changed for me

1313
01:26:53,833 --> 01:26:59,130
because I learned from watching my dad
heroically fail.

1314
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:01,633
[laughter]

1315
01:27:02,967 --> 01:27:05,929
"I learned that a hero
doesn't have to win,

1316
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:10,642
and a hero doesn't have to beat up
an enemy or revenge himself to be a hero."

1317
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:14,729
"And I also learned we really haven't lost

1318
01:27:14,812 --> 01:27:19,859
because we've taken the worst beating
in history, and we're still here..."

1319
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:25,365
"writing, inventing, dancing,
and just not giving up."

1320
01:27:26,658 --> 01:27:30,620
"And, um,
because of a situation that I had,

1321
01:27:30,703 --> 01:27:33,331
I was forced to, um... look inside myself,

1322
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:39,087
and that's when I saw that in some ways,
I've got lots of heroes in me.

1323
01:27:39,170 --> 01:27:41,631
Because I am Cesar Chavez,

1324
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:45,677
and I am Céspedes of the Mets,
even though he's always injured."

"And I am Sonia Sotomayor."

01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:03,903
"And I am definitely not Ted Cruz."

[laughter]

1330
01:28:08,825 --> 01:28:10,576
"But the biggest thing I learned

1331
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:14,038
while I was, uh,
failing outta school this past year

1332
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:19,127
was, as one of my fellow classmates
once said to me,

1333
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:21,838
'You're the king of nothing.'"

1334
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:28,720
"But if the Mayans
invented the concept of zero...

1335
01:28:28,803 --> 01:28:31,514
then nothing is not nothing.

1336
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:34,267
And if they can make something
out of nothing..." "then my hero is..."

01:28:38,938 --> 01:28:39,939
"My..." "hero..."

Thank you. Thank you.
