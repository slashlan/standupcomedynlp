1
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:18,018
(audience cheering,
applauding)

2
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,697
- Thank you!

3
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,199
Thank you!

4
00:00:35,745 --> 00:00:37,997
Oh my God.
Thank you.

5
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,665
Thank you for coming out.

6
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,459
(audience cheering)

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,335
It's good to be here.

8
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,670
This is what I look like.

9
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,091
It's mostly my fault.

10
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,886
Well, it's all my fault.

11
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:53,846
I wish I had
an excuse, you know?

12
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:57,266
Like I had to gain
all this weight for a movie.

13
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:59,518
There's no movie.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,978
If you saw me eat,
you would think

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,231
there were multiple movies.

16
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:08,152
Are they doing a
live action "Shrek?"

17
00:01:08,194 --> 00:01:11,447
This guy's gonna be perfect!

18
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,574
I'm wearing my shirt untucked.

19
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,493
The untucked shirt.

20
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:19,747
The fat man's last hurrah.

21
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,793
Next stop muumuu.

22
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:25,002
You might see a guy
with his shirt untucked

23
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:28,798
and think,
"Oh, was he in a hurry?

24
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,175
Is he going casual?"

25
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:32,760
But you should know
that someone very close

26
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:35,346
to that man saw him
with his shirt tucked in,

27
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,682
and said, "Don't do that.

28
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,435
"That's visually unpleasing.

29
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:45,356
You look better
not fully dressed."

30
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:50,319
The untucked shirt,
it's like the male wonder bra.

31
00:01:50,361 --> 00:01:53,572
There's a surprise
underneath and...

32
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,826
you're not gonna like it.

33
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,078
(audience applauding)

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,748
This is not an UNTUCKit.

35
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,250
UNTUCKit, which is
a brand of shirt.

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,919
I do love those
UNTUCKit commercials.

37
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:10,840
They present it like some
revolutionary technology.

38
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:15,344
It's a shirt that can
be worn untucked.

39
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:18,430
Wow!

40
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,684
Like a magic shirt?

41
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,935
That's right.

42
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:25,479
Can other shirts do that?

43
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:27,064
No, this is a special shirt.

44
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:30,818
It goes with our
unzipped pants.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,153
And our unbuckled
belt, and combined

46
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:37,408
with your uncombed hair
you can look unemployed.

47
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,536
And be unwelcome
in restaurants.

48
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:44,039
That's unbelievable.

49
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,379
This shirt is actually a 2XL.

50
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:54,216
That's right, I did it.

51
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:57,720
Mission accomplished.

52
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,388
(audience cheering,
applauding)

53
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,979
There should be a moving up
ceremony for when you hit 2XL.

54
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:09,648
It is with great pride
and slight disgust,

55
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,942
that we present
this garment roughly

56
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:14,904
the size of a circus tent,

57
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:19,450
to this slob who
actually struggles to
put on his own socks.

58
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:23,287
He may now burp for
no reason at all.

59
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,706
I am new to the 2XL community.

60
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:29,168
They've been very welcoming.

61
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,336
I did some research.

62
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,588
You know what
the size after 2XL is?

63
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,674
Kill yourself.

64
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:38,052
No, it's 3X!

65
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,720
Triple X!

66
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:43,557
That's pornographic.

67
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,561
It's so fat it's obscene.

68
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:51,941
Triple X does sound like
some fat on fat action.

69
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,611
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,488
Oh, yeah.
And I'm headin' there,

71
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,699
hopefully by
the end of the show.

72
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,992
I don't know what happened.

73
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:07,539
All I did was eat
abusively for 40 years.

74
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,709
And suddenly I'm fat?

75
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,128
That doesn't seem fair.

76
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,588
I am now at the size,

77
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,465
when I go in clothing
stores sales people

78
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,176
look at me like,
"We got nothing for you.

79
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:21,220
And you can't
use our bathroom."

80
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,308
When I go out to eat,
if I order a salad,

81
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,853
the waiter's
always like, "Aw.

82
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:33,065
Look at you try."

83
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:35,150
I'm always afraid he's gonna
gather the whole staff,

84
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:39,613
"The fat pig is trying,
the fat pig is trying, I..."

85
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,532
(audience laughs)

86
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,409
I've always talked
about my weight

87
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,412
in my stand up but in
the past after shows

88
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,288
if I ran into audience
members they'd be

89
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,291
like, "Jim, you're not that
fat, you're not that fat."

90
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,752
But now after shows people
are like, "Good show."

91
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:56,755
(audience laughs)

92
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,342
"You nailed it."

93
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:03,095
I don't care.
I like to eat!

94
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,514
I like to eat.
You know, when you like to eat,

95
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:08,308
what's weird is people
assume you enjoy cooking.

96
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,893
(audience laughs)

97
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,230
Well, you must know your
way around the kitchen.

98
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:16,108
I know where the food is.

99
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,318
Well, you must love to cook.

100
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,778
Look, I like to sleep.

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,739
It doesn't mean
I wanna build a bed.

102
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,866
(audience laughs)

103
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,036
The truth is, I don't
like to do anything.

104
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,912
Like when I order
delivery, I'm kind

105
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,583
of annoyed they don't
know what I want already.

106
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,752
What, do I have
to do everything?

107
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,592
I did lose some weight
last summer, thank you.

108
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,010
-Thank you.
-(audience applauding)

109
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,179
I did. I did.

110
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,265
Well, I had
my appendix removed.

111
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,101
But it still counts.

112
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,187
I didn't know what
the appendix was,

113
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:56,231
and since I'm an idiot I
just pretended like I did.

114
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,151
The doctor was like, "We have
to remove your appendix,"

115
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:03,363
and I was, like,
"Both of them?"

116
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,615
Luckily he thought
I was kidding.

117
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,867
He was, like...
(imitates laughing)

118
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:07,951
Ah!

119
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,581
I'm so grateful
he didn't call me out.

120
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,041
I don't know what
I would've said, you know?

121
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,834
Like, "There's
only one appendix."

122
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:21,507
"Oh, ha ha, appendix.
I-- I thought you said lungs.

123
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:27,096
To me they sound
similar 'cause I'm dumb."

124
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:29,640
I didn't know what
the appendix was,

125
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,100
but I don't feel that bad.

126
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,227
The doctor told me
science isn't even sure

127
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,979
what the appendix
does exactly.

128
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,441
Science isn't even sure
why the appendix exists.

129
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,401
And I heard that and
I was, like, oh my gosh,

130
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:45,864
the appendix is
like a Kardashian.

131
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,199
It is.

132
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,703
(audience cheering,
applauding)

133
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,541
Think about it.
It's a mystery to everyone.

134
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,503
But for some of us,
causes excruciating pain.

135
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:02,506
It needs to be
removed with a knife.

136
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:05,926
Obviously, I'm not
promoting violence,

137
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,220
against any of
the Kardashians.

138
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:12,224
Just the mother.

139
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:14,226
There's always one person
that gets too into that joke.

140
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,436
"Yes, kill the mother.

141
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,690
Kill her and smear
her blood on my face."

142
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,567
(audience laughs)

143
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:23,026
I think it's strange

144
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,487
science doesn't know
what the appendix does.

145
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,364
That means nobody knows.

146
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,366
You never hear,
"Science doesn't know,

147
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,828
"but Earl has a theory.

148
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,457
Earl, when you were
cleaning the toilet,
you mumbled something."

149
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:39,459
How is that
an acceptable answer

150
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,213
from the entire
scientific community?

151
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,967
"Yeah, we don't know.

152
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:51,346
Well, back to
cloning everything."

153
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,474
And they just
remove the appendix.

154
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,351
That's the solution.
Take it out!

155
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,520
We don't know
what it does.

156
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:00,022
And it's fine.

157
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,732
But you know the first time
they did it,

158
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,027
"We removed your appendix.
Let's see what happens."

159
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,617
I had my appendix
removed in Alaska.

160
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,703
That's not why I went there.

161
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,413
I was on vacation
with my family,

162
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:18,957
and I had this sharp
pain in my abdomen,

163
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,418
and since I'm a genius,
my first thought was,

164
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,006
"Oh, I pulled a
muscle in my stomach."

165
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,801
That's what
I sincerely thought.

166
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:33,764
See all these muscles?

167
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:37,226
I thought I pulled one...

168
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,395
doin' nothin'.

169
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,189
And the pain
was overwhelming.

170
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,732
I couldn't move.

171
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,359
My wife was like,
"I'm gonna go for help,

172
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,526
I'm gonna go for help."

173
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,946
But we're in a
remote area of Alaska

174
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,531
so she just ran
to nearby cabins.

175
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,700
Eventually she came back
all out of breath.

176
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,160
She's like, "I found a guy,
I found a guy."

177
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,828
I was, like, "Oh good,
is he a doctor?"

178
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,829
She goes, "No."

179
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,914
I go, "Is he a nurse?"

180
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:02,000
She goes, "He's a lawyer."

181
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,879
I guess he can do my will.

182
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,216
So then this
lawyer-doctor came over,

183
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,884
and started
asking me questions,

184
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,928
and when you're in pain
all questions are annoying.

185
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,429
He's like,
"Do you have a fever?"

186
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:17,599
And I was like,
"Are you even a lawyer?"

187
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:18,934
He's like,
"Is it a dull pain?"

188
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:22,729
"There's nothing
boring about this."

189
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:26,358
Eventually I had to be
airlifted on advice of counsel.

190
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,111
(audience laughs)

191
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:32,322
I was airlifted,
which was embarrassing,

192
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,700
'cause unlike a heroic
airlift if someone

193
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,078
from a natural disaster
or a wounded solider,

194
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,289
I was just a fat guy
with a tummy ache.

195
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,417
(audience laughs)

196
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:48,338
The helicopter pilot was like,
"Wait, your stomach hurts?"

197
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,426
"Yeah, it's real sore."

198
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:55,721
"Do you know how much it
costs to rent a helicopter?"

199
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:58,056
"But my tummy hurts."

200
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,184
I knew it was expensive.

201
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,312
I sat on that helicopter
the entire ride

202
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,731
just holding my
stomach and praying,

203
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,442
praying, "Please
don't let this be gas."

204
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,694
(audience laughs)

205
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:14,531
"Sweet Jesus,
don't let this be gas.

206
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,701
'Cause if it's gas
I don't think I can
return to my family."

207
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,494
(audience laughs)

208
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,704
Hey kids, daddy's back.

209
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:23,290
Had some gas.

210
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,791
Took a helicopter ride.

211
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,586
None of you wanted to
go to college did ya?

212
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,087
It's a little out of
our price range now.

213
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,714
We don't know what
caused the gas.

214
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:34,217
It might've been daddy's
three breakfast burritos.

215
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:37,763
Pretty much
a medical mystery.

216
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,806
I was airlifted to
the closest hospital.

217
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,058
They removed my appendix.

218
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,225
They did a good job.

219
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,727
I mean, I'm female now.

220
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,064
(audience laughs)

221
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,316
The surgeon who
removed my appendix,

222
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,861
his name was Dr. Muffuletta.

223
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:57,741
Which is also the name of a
delicious New Orleans sandwich.

224
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:00,911
And I do look like a
guy who would know that.

225
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:02,662
So when he introduced
himself I was like,

226
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:07,209
am I being visited by
the ghost of sandwich past?

227
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,544
Is Nurse Po'Boy
about to come in?

228
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,589
(audience laughs)

229
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,425
I woke up after the surgery
covered in Mardi Gras beads.

230
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,011
(audience laughs)

231
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,055
No, I woke up and there
was a nurse standing there

232
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,349
and she was like,
"The surgery was a success.

233
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:24,476
Just let me know if
it hurts when you pee,"

234
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,895
and I was like wait,
where's the appendix?

235
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,022
(audience laughs)

236
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:32,067
How exactly did you remove it?

237
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,695
This doesn't sound
like a success at all.

238
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,281
Then she explained,
right before the surgery,

239
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,075
they inserted a catheter.

240
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,994
I didn't know what that
was so I was like, "Oh, okay."

241
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,621
And then I started
piecing it together.

242
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:46,164
It hurts when I pee,
catheter.

243
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,126
I'm suing this hospital!

244
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:53,088
You'll be hearing
from my lawyer-doctor.

245
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,506
What monsters.

246
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:57,634
If given a choice of
peeing all over myself,

247
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,179
or having a tube
inserted in my penis...

248
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,475
I'll take the pee shower.

249
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:08,437
I guess I'm old
fashioned, you know?

250
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:12,566
(audience cheering,
applauding)

251
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,152
Checking out of the hospital,
the desk clerk was so excited.

252
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,820
He was like, "You had
your appendix removed.

253
00:12:16,862 --> 00:12:18,989
I had my gallbladder
taken out."

254
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:22,159
I was like, "We should
vacation together.

255
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,952
"What are the odds
two fat Americans

256
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,539
had surgery on their
digestive system?"

257
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,959
I was released from the hospital
the day after the surgery.

258
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,586
They gave me pain killers.

259
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,172
They also instructed
me to do some walking,

260
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,048
which I assume was
part of the recovery,

261
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:41,428
but it kind of felt like
a commentary on my weight.

262
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,931
"Have you ever
done any walking?

263
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,224
"Have you ever leaned
forward and let

264
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:50,312
"your legs propel
your fat ass?

265
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,649
Let's take a break from
your motorized scooter."

266
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,152
And I was in Alaska, so
I said this was perfect.

267
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,654
So I returned to my family,
and we immediately

268
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,656
went on a hike
and it was great.

269
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,658
Alaska's beautiful.
My kids were havin' fun.

270
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,454
I was pretending like
I enjoyed being outside.

271
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:10,999
And then suddenly we saw
a bear, like, 500 yards away,

272
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:16,379
this huge brown bear, like,
way bigger then a gummy bear.

273
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:18,548
And I was so excited
'cause I watch nature shows,

274
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,425
but I had never seen
a bear in person

275
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,552
so it felt like
a celebrity sighting.

276
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:26,181
I was like, "Oh my God, I've
watched you on Animal Planet.

277
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,682
"You're so much taller
in person.

278
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,935
Can we do a selfie?"

279
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,895
But unlike
a celebrity sighting,

280
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:34,814
there was the risk of death.

281
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,441
Like, you never hear,
we're in restaurant,

282
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,984
Tom Hanks walked in
and then

283
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,404
he came over and
murdered my family.

284
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,157
That never happens.

285
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,159
But the bear was far away,
so I took out

286
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,203
my phone and I started
taking pictures,

287
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:50,080
and then suddenly
the bear stood up,

288
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,500
roared and looked
right at me.

289
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,918
Started creeping towards me,

290
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,253
tilting his head
back and forth

291
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,923
almost like
he recognized me.

292
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,384
"That guy looks like
Phillip Seymour Hoffman."

293
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:06,763
(audience cheering,
applauding)

294
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,558
I was terrified.

295
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,476
Luckily, we were
with a tour guide,

296
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,852
and I looked at him
and he goes, "Don't worry,

297
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,396
I have bear spray,"
and I was like,

298
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,815
"Do you have
anything stronger?

299
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,192
"Like a bear gun?

300
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,735
"'Cause I don't think
this bear's

301
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,780
approaching to
get his hair done."

302
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,991
And the bear kept coming,
kept coming,

303
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,742
and then suddenly
the tour guide goes,

304
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,912
"Okay, I want everyone to
start walking backwards slowly.

305
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,081
Walk backwards slowly."

306
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:37,252
I guess, so the
bear could catch up.

307
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,588
So we started walking
backwards slowly.

308
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,924
By then the bear
was in a full sprint.

309
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:47,971
I had surgery 12 hours ago,
so I smelled delicious.

310
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,806
I was also sunburned,
so I probably

311
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:53,810
looked like
a giant land salmon.

312
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,395
The bear couldn't
believe his luck,

313
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:58,481
like, "I'm not gonna have
to eat for a month."

314
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,691
I was like,
"I'm gonna die!

315
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,318
I'm gonna be
eaten by a bear!"

316
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:06,156
Which is ironic given how
many animals I've eaten.

317
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,991
So I started humming
"Circle of Life,"

318
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,036
and continued walking
backwards slowly.

319
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,746
I should point out
it's not like

320
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,540
we were walking backwards
slowly to a car or a cabin.

321
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,544
We were walking backwards
slowly to nothing.

322
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,546
It probably looked like
we were teasing the bear

323
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,175
like, "Come
and get it, Mr. Bear.

324
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,845
"Are you looking to
get a little grisly?

325
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:32,098
Craving a little 2XL
are you?"

326
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,643
And before you knew it
the bear was upon us,

327
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,729
and he killed us
and we died.

328
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:39,105
Such a bloody mess.

329
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,691
No, what really happened,

330
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,693
is at one point the tour
guide pulled out this thing,

331
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,528
it looked like a pen.

332
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,865
I was like, "Great, he's gonna
ask for the bears autograph."

333
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,700
And I learned later on
it was a bear flare,

334
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,911
and he squeezed it,
and this tiny fire ball

335
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,163
went out towards the bear
and I was like, "Oh good,

336
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,750
something to anger the bear."

337
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,543
The fireball bounced
off the bear.

338
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,546
The bear stopped and then
just ran the other way

339
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:06,716
like it forgot
something at home.

340
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,094
And we all looked at each
other like, "Oh my gosh,

341
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,137
that just happened,
that just happened."

342
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,681
And that's a true story.

343
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,934
Well, most of that's true.

344
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,728
Well, it's all true
except there was no bear.

345
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:21,940
(audience cheering,
applauding)

346
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,530
And--

347
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,491
No, there was a bear.

348
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,787
I do sometimes lie up here.

349
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,164
I'm not proud of it.

350
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,916
But sometimes we
all have to lie.

351
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,086
Like, even when I tell
my children not to lie,

352
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,964
I'm kind of lying to them.

353
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,425
Some people are like, "You
should never lie to a child,"

354
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,720
and those people
don't have kids.

355
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,180
'Cause when you have kids,
you lie to them all the time.

356
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,598
You're, like, "You wouldn't
like this ice cream,

357
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,894
"it's very spicy.

358
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:03,231
"I'd share but
Santa said I can't.

359
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,567
Now why don't you go to sleep
so I can wrestle your mom?"

360
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:10,905
(audience laughs)

361
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,824
I'm not encouraging lying.

362
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,994
I'm just saying there are
times when you need to, right?

363
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,912
Like if you're late
to meet someone,

364
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,998
and you can see that
they're already angry,

365
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,877
and you don't have an excuse,
you have to lie.

366
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,503
'Cause if you told
that person the truth,

367
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,089
they would never
speak to you again.

368
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:29,549
You can't be like,
"Hey, I gotta come clean.

369
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,178
I just couldn't
motivate to get goin'."

370
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,929
"I mean,
eventually I could.

371
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,890
What I'm tryin' to say is
I don't value your time."

372
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:40,518
(audience laughs)

373
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,270
I've identified
there are two times

374
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,856
when it's socially
acceptable to lie.

375
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,317
To spare someone's feelings,
it's okay to lie.

376
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,361
It's also okay to lie
to cover up a murder.

377
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,572
(audience laughs)

378
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,909
Allow me to explain.

379
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,495
When we discover
someone's a murderer,

380
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,789
we also learn they've
done some fibbin'.

381
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,584
But we tend to focus
on the murder part.

382
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,795
You never hear, "I'm angry
he killed that guy,

383
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,589
but frankly I'm more upset
about the lying."

384
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:13,051
It's the dishonesty
that bothers me.

385
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,095
Some trust has been broken.

386
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,847
Speaking of lying murderers,

387
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:21,184
I watch a lot of "Dateline."
I don't wanna brag.

388
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:24,270
Some other winners out there.

389
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,398
If you're unfamiliar or
you have a life, "Dateline"--

390
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,025
(audience laughs)

391
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,070
is a news magazine
show like "60 Minutes,"

392
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:37,283
but at one point "Dateline"
just went all-in on murder.

393
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,244
And it's usually
spousal murder.

394
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,037
Like if you watch
"Dateline," it appears

395
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,081
most marriages
end in murder.

396
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:46,709
(audience laughs)

397
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,670
Every episode
starts the same.

398
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,882
They had the perfect
marriage.

399
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:56,135
But you know someone's
gettin' killed.

400
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,554
A husband, a wife.

401
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,972
Sometimes they'll
get someone else

402
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:02,225
to kill their spouse,
which seems impersonal.

403
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:05,812
Like, you took a vow,
do it yourself.

404
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,605
(audience laughs)

405
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,524
Anyway, I was watchin'
this one episode

406
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,401
of "Dateline" about this
guy who murdered his wife.

407
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,819
It was gruesome.

408
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:17,156
I was watchin' with my
wife on our anniversary.

409
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,783
My wife didn't care.

410
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:22,120
I mean, she wasn't thrilled
I was taking notes.

411
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
"What are you writing down?"

412
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,999
"This guy's just sloppy.

413
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,127
It's like he's
tryin' to get caught."

414
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,338
If anything, this guy's
plan was full proof.

415
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,132
What he did
on his anniversary

416
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,925
is he threw a party
for him and his wife,

417
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:37,552
and they invited
all their friends

418
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,762
so that they could see
how happy they were,

419
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,265
and then the next morning
he took his wife fishing.

420
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,100
He rented a boat,
he brought a cooler,

421
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,562
some tackle, three
concrete blocks and a tarp.

422
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,480
(audience laughs)

423
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,525
You know, for fishing.

424
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,611
And he woulda gotten
away with the whole thing,

425
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:58,698
but three months after his
wife disappeared at sea,

426
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,951
he got engaged
to a stripper.

427
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:04,537
Which is kinda suspicious.

428
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,414
And to celebrate
their engagement,

429
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,125
they dropped acid,
as tradition would have.

430
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,669
(audience laughs)

431
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,755
And while tripping
on acid, he admitted

432
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,549
the whole thing
to his fiance.

433
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:20,720
And she turned him in
'cause she didn't
appreciate the dishonesty.

434
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:23,389
(audience laughs)

435
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,225
(audience cheering,
applauding)

436
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,774
And as the episode ended
all I could think is,

437
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,777
"I'm a terrific husband."

438
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:39,614
I've never even thought
of murdering my wife.

439
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:44,035
Well, I've never made
plans to murder my wife.

440
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:47,246
Well, I don't own
concrete blocks.

441
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:49,374
(audience laughs)

442
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,292
I can see some of
you are like,

443
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:54,295
"Jim, I don't
like the murder jokes.
I don't like them."

444
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,755
But wouldn't it
be great if

445
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,967
in a week, you learned
I was a murderer?

446
00:20:59,008 --> 00:21:00,343
'Cause then you could brag.

447
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:01,719
You could be like,
"Oh my gosh,

448
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,263
"we were at the taping
for his special.

449
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,684
And he had all these
jokes on murder."

450
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,977
"Were they good?"

451
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,562
"Not really, no.

452
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,817
He was better at
murder than comedy."

453
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,235
If you know me,
I would do anything

454
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,779
for my wife, and that's
part of my alibi.

455
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,281
No, I--

456
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,994
(audience cheering,
applauding)

457
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:27,745
I would do anything
for my wife,

458
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,789
but I'm not
a romantic person.

459
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,165
I wish I was.

460
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,875
There are moments when
it's glaringly obvious.

461
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,003
I get to travel so
much during stand up.

462
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,213
I did a show in Cologne,
Germany,

463
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:39,632
and before the show, I was
walking over this bridge

464
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,175
that went across
the Rhine River,

465
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,177
and as I walked across,
I noticed

466
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,971
there were
hundreds of locks,

467
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:46,806
hundreds of locks
on this bridge,

468
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,474
and each of the locks
had two initials,

469
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,560
and it was apparent
that couples

470
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,103
had put the lock there

471
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:54,313
as a symbol
of their relationship,

472
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,524
and I looked at it and
I thought, "That's perfect."

473
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:01,362
Nothing captures love
like a rusty padlock,

474
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:05,199
dangling over filthy water.

475
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:08,661
But it was visually spectacular
and it affected me.

476
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,455
I'm almost embarrassed
to admit this.

477
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,041
I found myself
spending the next hour

478
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,377
just kind of looking
for a hardware store

479
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:18,046
in this town I
had never been in.

480
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,048
I spent an hour
looking and eventually

481
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,424
I found a hardware store.

482
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,218
I went in and I
bought a bolt cutter.

483
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,639
(audience cheering,
applauding)

484
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:33,561
And I went back and I started
snipping off the locks.

485
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,731
And with each snip
I said, "It's over.

486
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:39,400
It's over.
You're free."

487
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:43,988
And people were
givin' me dirty looks.

488
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,949
What a grand romantic
gesture right?

489
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:51,954
But, you know the first guy
who did that was a psycho.

490
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,207
Like his partner
or girlfriend was

491
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:57,043
not a willing participant.

492
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,795
He was like,
"You're probably wondering

493
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:03,091
"why I brought you to
the middle of the bridge,

494
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,009
"in March.

495
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,554
I'm gonna do something
you'll never ever forget."

496
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:12,558
She was like, "Oh my gosh,
are you gonna jump?"

497
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,562
"No. I wanna
put this lock here.

498
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,232
"I'll put it here as
a symbol of our love.

499
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,567
"Soon others will do it,
and the bridge

500
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,528
"will be covered with locks.

501
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,822
"But you'll know
that the first lock

502
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,533
was the symbol of our love."

503
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,078
And the woman's like,
"Is that my bike lock?"

504
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,872
(audience laughs)

505
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:35,832
"Not anymore."

506
00:23:35,873 --> 00:23:39,585
(audience laughs)

507
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:44,132
"Jim, that's a sad story."

508
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:47,093
Recently, I was invited to
a surprise birthday party.

509
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:52,098
It was a surprise
birthday party for a dog.

510
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,934
That's right, I have friends
that are mentally ill.

511
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,311
(audience laughs)

512
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,272
I went, I went. It was in
my apartment building

513
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:00,898
and I needed the material.

514
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,110
(audience laughs)

515
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:08,281
And to be fair,
the dog was surprised.

516
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,783
Didn't suspect a thing.

517
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,451
Dog didn't know
it was his birthday.

518
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:15,204
The dog didn't know
it had a birthday.

519
00:24:15,246 --> 00:24:19,417
The dog wasn't sure why
people were in the apartment.

520
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,127
It was the dog's
third birthday,

521
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:23,296
which in dog years
doesn't matter.

522
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:25,423
(audience laughs)

523
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,758
Someone made that up and
we just went along with it.

524
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,052
Oh, one year equals
seven for doggies?

525
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,929
Okay.

526
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:36,184
When I see a dog,
I'll do math.

527
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:39,187
That's not fulfilling
some dog need, you know?

528
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,814
There's not a dog sitting
in a bar right now

529
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,610
going, "I'm not three,
I'm 21!

530
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,988
I can legally drink!"

531
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,533
That's not how dogs
keep track of time.

532
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,703
If you have a dog, you know
they don't keep track of time.

533
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:57,455
You've left your home,
forgotten something,

534
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,248
walked back in
only to be greeted

535
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,335
by your dog like you've
just returned from war.

536
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:05,504
"You're back!
It's a miracle!

537
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:09,050
You're back after I don't know
how long 'cause I'm a dog."

538
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:13,262
(audience laughs)

539
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:16,140
These poor dogs.

540
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:20,811
We just attach these points
of view on these poor dogs.

541
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,022
Like dog
is man's best friend.

542
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,275
How desperate are humans?

543
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,945
We're best friends, right?

544
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:32,907
Dog's like, "Well, aren't
we different species?"

545
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,408
"But we're
best friends forever."

546
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,121
"You know you lock me
in the house all day,

547
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:42,458
"with nothing but
a bowl of water.

548
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,545
You'd think you'd let your
best friend sit on the couch."

549
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,673
"We're best friends. Now
put on this fireman's outfit.

550
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:52,551
We're gonna do a photo
shoot for Instagram."

551
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:54,053
"You know sometimes
when you sleep,

552
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,513
I think about
eating your face."

553
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,266
(audience laughs)

554
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,604
But I get it.
I love dogs too.

555
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:05,439
I love animals.

556
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,024
We all have a friend
that announces

557
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,151
they love animals
in a way that implies

558
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,280
the rest of us
are drowning kittens.

559
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:15,783
"Yeah, but I love animals."

560
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,702
Well, that's a pretty
exclusive group

561
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:22,164
of just you and anyone
who's not a serial killer.

562
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,500
"Yeah, but I just get
along with animals better."

563
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,627
Or humans don't like you.

564
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:30,923
(audience laughs)

565
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,050
I did have
an opportunity to

566
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,303
go on a safari,
which was unbelievable.

567
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,097
It was breathtaking
how bad the wifi was.

568
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,808
(audience laughs)

569
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,435
I went on a safari
which is just

570
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:46,147
a fancy word
for animal stalking.

571
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,523
'Cause that's what
you do on a safari.

572
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,358
You follow animals
and watch them.

573
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,110
You're like...

574
00:26:58,075 --> 00:26:59,076
Beautiful.

575
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,580
(audience laughs)

576
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,290
It's a good thing
these animals

577
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:07,293
can't report us
to the police.

578
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:10,046
"Yeah, officer, that fat
guy in the untucked shirt

579
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:14,717
"followed me for an
hour this morning.

580
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,012
"I woke up and he was taking
pictures of me and my family.

581
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,723
(audience laughs)

582
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,726
"We were naked.

583
00:27:23,768 --> 00:27:25,770
Yeah, the guy who looks like
Phillip Seymour Hoffman."

584
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:29,607
(audience laughs)

585
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,693
On the safari, I saw one
animal kill another animal,

586
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:34,612
and intellectually I was,
like, I don't wanna see that,

587
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,282
but emotionally in the
moment I was like, "Get him."

588
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,202
"Kill it!"

589
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,579
My kids were totally
savage about it.

590
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,957
They're like, "Kill him,
kill him! I want blood."

591
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,542
My kids were with me.

592
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:53,089
My kids were poorly
behaved on a safari.

593
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,548
They're six and seven,

594
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,592
and animals would walk by
like, "Savages."

595
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,969
(audience laughs)

596
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,722
My two youngest are six
and seven year old boys,

597
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,891
and they're total savages.

598
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,559
They're constantly
picking on me.

599
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,686
They're jumping on me
and they pick on me.

600
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:10,231
How they pick on me recently
is they make fun of my,

601
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,858
what they call
my huge boy part.

602
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,528
(audience laughs)

603
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,697
Now before you think I'm
walking around the house naked,

604
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:22,785
or in fact
have a huge boy part,

605
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,579
you should know that, like,
when you have young sons,

606
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,374
you have to constantly
encourage them to
use the bathroom,

607
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,418
and if you're a dad,
sometimes you pee with them,

608
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,421
so that's why they've
seen my boy part.

609
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,964
But that doesn't
explain why sometimes

610
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,632
at dinner, they'll
just point at me

611
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:41,095
and giggle, and go,
"Dad and his huge boy part."

612
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,388
I never know what to say.

613
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,724
I'm like, "Guilty."

614
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,810
"Got me again.
Did you hear that honey?"

615
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,563
(audience laughs)

616
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:58,612
Lovely weather out there.

617
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,406
(audience laughs)

618
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:02,491
I prefer the cold to hot.
I do.

619
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:04,410
I know that's surprising
looking at me,

620
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:07,037
given I look like a snowman.

621
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,914
(audience cheering,
applauding)

622
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,583
But I prefer
the cold you know?

623
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,585
Last summer
I was in Las Vegas.

624
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:15,421
It was 114 degrees.

625
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:17,256
114 degrees.

626
00:29:17,298 --> 00:29:19,967
You can actually hear
the sun at that point.

627
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,720
(imitates sun crackling)

628
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,472
It didn't feel safe.

629
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:28,434
I was, like, "Are we
supposed to be here?"

630
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,102
114-- Like, you're never
at a friends house

631
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:31,520
and, "Warm in here."

632
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:35,191
"Yeah, I set the
thermostat to 114.

633
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,735
That's how I like it.
I'm part lizard."

634
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,237
(audience laughs)

635
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,156
Thermostats don't
even go up that high.

636
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:46,118
Meat thermometers do.

637
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,079
I think God is just
cooking people in Vegas.

638
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,623
(imitates sun crackling)

639
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,958
"Ooh, that one's smoking.
I love smoked meat."

640
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,461
(imitates sun crackling)

641
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:59,048
It was 114 degrees,
which was shocking,

642
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:02,551
but not as shocking as how
casually Las Vegas residents

643
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,595
just went about their
day in that heat.

644
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,930
It was like...
(imitates sun crackling)

645
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,306
They were like,
"Let's play Frisbee.

646
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,516
Time to walk the dog."

647
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,435
I was like, "Get inside!

648
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,355
"The Earth is on fire!

649
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:18,484
"Get inside and beg
for God's forgiveness.

650
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:22,154
You've obviously angered him!"

651
00:30:22,196 --> 00:30:24,198
That's why Vegas
is called Sin City,

652
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,160
it's the same
temperature as Hell.

653
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,995
I have a friend
from Vegas.

654
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,121
I told him it was 114.

655
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,498
He goes, "That's nothin'."

656
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,209
I'm like,
"No, that's somethin'.

657
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:38,420
That's actually the
temperature you boil water at."

658
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:42,508
He's, like, "It's not that bad."
"Not if you're makin' Ramen."

659
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:44,051
He's, like,
"That's our summer."

660
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,928
That's not summer.

661
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,846
Summer is when you
barbecue on the grill,

662
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,224
not the side walk.

663
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:53,686
It's so weird to be places
where summer is the enemy.

664
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,896
I was, like, in the
southwest, they talk

665
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,565
about summer like
it's an ex lover

666
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,650
they never wanna see again.

667
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:04,154
"We gotta get outta here
before summer gets here.

668
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:08,576
Last year, I couldn't leave my
house when summer was here."

669
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,536
You ever notice the
further north you go,

670
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:12,746
the more obsessed
people are with summer?

671
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,666
Like I-- In February,
I was in Bangor, Maine,

672
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,585
and everyone was
talking about summer.

673
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,795
Everyone I met, they're
like, "You gotta come
back during summer.

674
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:21,922
You gotta come back."

675
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,674
Which is a strange
way to greet someone.

676
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,384
"Hi, how are ya?
Come back later."

677
00:31:25,426 --> 00:31:28,470
(audience laughs)

678
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,805
And it was everyone.

679
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,098
"You gotta come
back during summer,

680
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,976
you gotta, I'm--"
"Yeah but I'm here now."

681
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,853
"Just make sure
you come back."

682
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,730
"I didn't wanna
come the first time."

683
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:39,773
(audience laughs)

684
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,192
But I love how northern
cities sell summer.

685
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,153
Like, "Summer here's
unbelievable.

686
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:47,740
It's perfect. For one twelfth
of the year it's ideal.

687
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,158
"Otherwise
it's a tundra filled

688
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,536
"with alcoholism
and depression.

689
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:55,914
But for those 13 odd
days it's worth it."

690
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,083
(audience laughs, cheers)

691
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,086
I did nothing today.

692
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,796
Didn't feel any
pressure to do anything.

693
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,840
Some places you feel like
a pressure to do something,

694
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:07,468
like St. Louis,
"You gotta go see our arch."

695
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,553
"I don't want to."

696
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,555
"Go look at our arch."

697
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:16,101
"Why don't I just go
McDonald's and see two?"

698
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:18,395
San Antonio, "You
gotta go to the Alamo."

699
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,689
"I was gonna nap."

700
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,691
"No, you're gonna stand
outside in blistering heat

701
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,777
and look at a building."

702
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:28,989
"Can't I just say
I forgot about the Alamo?"

703
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,158
You know who didn't
wanna go to the Alamo?

704
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,535
The people who
died at the Alamo.

705
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:35,037
I bet their
last thought was,

706
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,955
"I wish I didn't
go to the Alamo.

707
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:40,501
I thought it was a
rental car company."

708
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:43,170
Can you imagine
that level of bravery?

709
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:47,091
187 Texans fought
2,000 of Santa Anna's

710
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,677
finest Mexican troops
and at one point

711
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,929
those 180 Texans
just decided,

712
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,598
"We should just fight
'til we all die."

713
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,266
Like, if I was there
I would've been like,

714
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,519
"Excuse me.
I love the idea of Texas too,

715
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:03,273
"but have you tried
this Mexican food?

716
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:07,611
"It is delicioso.

717
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,824
I propose we remember
the guacamole."

718
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:15,619
Of course Vegas, the big
assignment is to gamble.

719
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,080
Nobody every admits
they gamble when
they go to Las Vegas.

720
00:33:18,122 --> 00:33:19,832
"You goin' to Vegas,
you gonna gamble?"

721
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,000
"No, I'm gonna see shows."

722
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,293
"You're not gonna
gamble at all?"

723
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,129
"Well, if I walk by
a poker table

724
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,842
"I might sit down
and lose $10,000.

725
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,429
I'm mainly going
for the shows."

726
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,431
We don't like to
admit we gamble.
People never admit it.

727
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,099
They're like,
"I'm not gambling,

728
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:39,101
"I'm just pulling this lever.
I like to pull levers.

729
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:40,811
"It's a good arm workout.

730
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:42,980
"I'm not gambling, I'm just
watching these horses run

731
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,899
and letting the winner
determine if I keep my home."

732
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:48,152
(audience laughs)

733
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,654
We are country that
loves to bet on horses.

734
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,698
Every spring,
we track the three races

735
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,032
of the Triple Crown,
and every spring

736
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,242
I always have
the same thought.

737
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,619
We're still doing this?

738
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,956
Is Woodrow Wilson president?

739
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:02,666
But people love
the Triple Crown.

740
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:05,127
The Kentucky Derby,
where people bet on horses

741
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:09,006
while they're dressed
like characters from
"Gone with the Wind."

742
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:12,301
It's like prom for gamblers.

743
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,802
"Do you like my hat?

744
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,512
I'm living in
my sisters garage."

745
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,848
(audience laughs)

746
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:21,143
"'Cause I have a debilitating
gambling addiction.

747
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:25,063
Shall we have
another mint julep?"

748
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,648
They always
announce the winner

749
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,941
of each race on the news.

750
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,359
You can always tell the horse

751
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,195
was named by a guy
on his eighth wife.

752
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,783
The horse is always named
like Viagra's Revenge.

753
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,619
Alimony Be Damned.

754
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,913
They show a picture of the
winning horse on the news.

755
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:42,539
They could show us
a picture of any horse,

756
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,833
we wouldn't
know the difference.

757
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,127
I don't know
what we're supposed
to do with that horse image.

758
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:51,215
It's not like we're gonna
run into that horse in a bar.

759
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,551
"Excuse me, did you win
the Kentucky Derby?"

760
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:57,679
"I did,
I won the Kentucky Derby.

761
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:01,517
Now I'm in a bar,
enjoying a Heiferweizen."

762
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,561
There is the classic photo
of the winning horse right?

763
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,647
They're always wearing
that huge horseshoe

764
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:10,776
wreath of flowers they stole
from someone's grave site.

765
00:35:10,818 --> 00:35:12,528
Standing next to
the winning horse

766
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:14,988
is the owner of the horse,
who did not train the horse,

767
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:17,699
did not ride the horse,
and based on body language

768
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,619
has never really
met the horse.

769
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:26,124
There the owner stands,
looking like they've
never paid taxes.

770
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,085
Sitting on top of
the winning horse

771
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,545
is the jockey,
who's dressed like

772
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:33,799
he just came from
a local pride parade.

773
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:36,218
They always interview the
jockey expecting some insight.

774
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,928
They're like, "How'd you win?"

775
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,097
The jockey's like, "I whipped
the horse and it ran."

776
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,099
(audience laughs)

777
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,268
It's very rare
for a horse to win

778
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,894
all three races in
the Triple Crown,

779
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:50,524
mainly 'cause they're
horses and they don't care.

780
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:54,403
Mostly they just want someone
to stop whipping them,

781
00:35:54,444 --> 00:35:56,530
'cause they're horses.

782
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:57,948
I didn't know this.

783
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,158
After the Triple Crown,
all those horses retire.

784
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:03,161
They retire
at the age of three.

785
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,539
It feels early.

786
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,499
They retire and then
they're sent out to stud.

787
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:10,002
Those horses get
paid to have sex,

788
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:14,172
which in some ways is better
than winning the Triple Crown.

789
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,884
That's like
the quadruple crown.

790
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:19,094
That's gotta be an
adjustment for those horses.

791
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,637
Like, "Hey, remember
when we whipped you

792
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,014
"and we wanted you to run?

793
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:24,391
"Well, now when we
whip you, we're gonna

794
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,351
have you do something
a little different."

795
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:29,730
(audience laughs)

796
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:33,150
"How many horse jokes
is this guy gonna do?

797
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,154
I never thought
I'd miss a murder joke."

798
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,115
There's a lot more
horse jokes.

799
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:43,869
And if you haven't noticed,
I know nothing about horses.

800
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:46,622
I don't horseback ride
mainly because

801
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:52,252
I prefer to be comfortable,
and it's not the 1800's.

802
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,046
I'm sure the horses
aren't thrilled either.

803
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,589
They're like, "Why am I
carrying you around?

804
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:58,592
I saw you drive up
in a Honda Civic?"

805
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:02,262
(audience cheering,
applauding)

806
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:03,972
But people like
to horseback ride.

807
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,891
I have a friend,
she told me the reason

808
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,310
she enjoys horseback riding
is 'cause she loves horses

809
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,228
which seems like
a strange way

810
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,648
of expressing love
for something.

811
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,943
Making it carry you
around on its back.

812
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:18,070
I mean I love my
Great Aunt Katie.

813
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:20,447
(audience laughs)

814
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,242
I'm not gonna make her
carry me around on her back.

815
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,285
Not anymore, yeah.

816
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,496
(audience laughs)

817
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,122
I don't even know why
we have to specify

818
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,708
that it's horse-back riding.

819
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,336
(audience laughs)

820
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:36,129
Are there people like,
"Hey, you wanna ride a horse?

821
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,382
What part?"

822
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,635
(audience laughs)

823
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:45,514
"The part that looks
like a seat, the back."

824
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:49,059
"Oh good, 'cause I've
done horse-ass riding.

825
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:51,061
That was painful,
I kept fallin' off."

826
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:53,438
(audience laughs)

827
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,023
I should probably tell you,

828
00:37:55,065 --> 00:37:57,317
the rest of the show
is all horse jokes.

829
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,069
(audience cheering,
applauding)

830
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:02,447
(gasps)
"Is he serious?"

831
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,866
(audience cheering,
applauding)

832
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,579
There are different
types of horses.

833
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,873
(audience laughs)

834
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,919
"He's gonna
keep going isn't he?"

835
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:18,255
No, there are breeds
of horses, right?

836
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,173
Which is different
from horse breeding.

837
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,217
I don't know if you've ever
seen two horses breed,

838
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:24,886
but that'll keep you
awake at night.

839
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:29,016
If you've never
seen two horses breed,
do not YouTube it.

840
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,518
Do not YouTube it and
print out still images.

841
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,145
Don't do that.

842
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,938
Don't affix your face
on one of the images

843
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,148
and show your wife
and think it's funny.

844
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,483
She won't think it's funny.

845
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:42,154
But that says more
about her then you.

846
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:43,238
What was I talkin' about?

847
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,699
Horses.

848
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,576
It's strange how
we treat horses.

849
00:38:47,617 --> 00:38:48,994
We give horses shoes.

850
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:51,872
I don't even know
if horses need shoes.

851
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,708
You never seen a horse in the
wild walking around like, "Ow!

852
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,418
"Ow!

853
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,838
I wish I had some damn shoes!"

854
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,466
We give horses shoes
that are metal.

855
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:03,550
Metal.

856
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:07,637
That's worse then Crocs.

857
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,681
That must be hard
to shop for right?

858
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:11,600
"Do you have anything in
metal but not a slip on?

859
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,770
Something I can
nail to my foot."

860
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:19,024
That's what we do,
we nail it to their foot!

861
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,359
And when we're not doing
that, we're literally

862
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:25,155
tossing the horseshoe
around as a game.

863
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:29,659
The horse must be like,
"What the hell are you
doin' with my shoes?

864
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,828
It probably looks like
we're taunting the horse.

865
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,706
"Hey, horse, why don't you
come and get your shoes?

866
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:36,374
"Why don't you go and grab it?

867
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:40,170
Oh, you can't, 'cause
you don't have hands!"

868
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:45,884
The horse shoe,
a symbol of luck for
everyone but the horse.

869
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,594
I don't know
if this is true.

870
00:39:47,636 --> 00:39:49,513
Someone told me that when
horses are sent out to stud,

871
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,767
some female horses will
wear high heel horse shoes.

872
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,227
Makes them more confident.

873
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,522
"I'm gonna be payin'
for this later on.

874
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,649
Oh, and I've been
on my feet all day."

875
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,485
(audience laughs)

876
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,949
"That's gotta be the
end of the horse jokes."

877
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,201
Horse people,

878
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:12,744
and I'm not
talkin' about people

879
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,580
that are half-horse,
half-human,

880
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,875
which are centaur's
and they don't exist...

881
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,378
anymore, right?

882
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,463
No, people who own
horses will tell you

883
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:26,591
that the horse can't even feel
the nail going in their foot.

884
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,593
Not that anyone's ever
heard a horse go,

885
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,887
"That's fine, hammer away.

886
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:33,515
Next time glue,
just don't tell me where
you got the glue from."

887
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:36,351
(audience laughs)

888
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:39,521
Oh, that was too edgy?

889
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:42,941
There's no horses in here.

890
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,568
There's not a horse
in the front row goin',

891
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:47,904
"Hey, take it easy on
the glue jokes. I'm gonna--"

892
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,281
I love how some of you
look for it.

893
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:50,949
"Is there a horse out there?"

894
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:52,742
(audience laughs)

895
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,875
It's strange how we
treat horses, you know?

896
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,626
The most shocking way
how we treat horses

897
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:05,881
is when they break
their leg, we shoot them.

898
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:09,176
That's a harsh medical plan.

899
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,844
And someone explained
the reason

900
00:41:10,886 --> 00:41:12,721
they shoot horses when
they break their leg

901
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,556
is 'cause it's
unlikely the leg

902
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:17,058
will heal properly,
and I was like, unlikely?

903
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,436
So there's a chance?

904
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,938
Can you imagine how
stressed out horses must be?

905
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,398
Like, "I stepped on a branch.

906
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,109
"It was a branch,
put down the gun!

907
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,527
Look at the branch,
it's a branch!"

908
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,070
Even if they're
injured they're like,

909
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:31,448
"I'll walk it off,
I'm gonna walk it off.

910
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,490
"Put the gun down, jeez.

911
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,076
"You guys, anyone?

912
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,369
"Have you ever
heard of Ben Gay?

913
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:38,205
What's goin' on?
Put down the gun!"

914
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,041
(audience laughs)

915
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:47,214
I can see on
some of your faces,

916
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:50,926
that you would frankly prefer
if I did more horse jokes.

917
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,761
(audience laughs)

918
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:57,182
(audience cheering,
applauding)

919
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,687
Okay.

920
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,356
(audience laughs)

921
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:06,942
It's odd, how we
treat horses 'cause

922
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:08,610
we live in this
era where we treat

923
00:42:08,652 --> 00:42:11,363
our dogs and cats
as family members.

924
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,615
People are always trying to
get their dog on an airplane.

925
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:15,200
You know it's just
a matter of time

926
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:17,577
before someone brings
a horse on a plane.

927
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:20,538
"Are you kidding me?

928
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,833
"This is my therapy horse.

929
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:26,711
He keeps me calm
on the flight."

930
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:31,007
"We'd like to welcome
our Silver Medallion
members to board.

931
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:34,928
"And anyone traveling
with a farm animal,

932
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,597
"you can board at Gate 47.

933
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:40,267
Feel free to grab some
sugar cubes that we've..."

934
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,103
(audience laughs)

935
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,775
Horse power.

936
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:49,985
(audience laughs)

937
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:56,074
Horse power is so
different from girl power.

938
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:59,244
Do you know what I mean?
It's like, "You go, horse!"

939
00:42:59,286 --> 00:43:02,163
Hey!

940
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,124
Hay is what horses eat.

941
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,918
(audience laughs)

942
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,338
Okay, I can tell at this point

943
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:14,175
there's probably one
or two, or 300 of you,

944
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:16,594
that are frankly annoyed
by the horse jokes.

945
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:18,471
(audience laughs)

946
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,348
And I want you to know that

947
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:23,143
your annoyance
gives me pleasure.

948
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,644
(audience laughs)

949
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:29,607
(audience cheering,
applauding)

950
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:33,403
All right, you know what?
That's, that's--

951
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,572
No more horse jokes.
I promise, I promise.

952
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,408
All right?
Anyway, um...

953
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,702
ponies...

954
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:41,995
are completely different.

955
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,164
(audience laughs)

956
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:45,457
Here's the problem with doing

957
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:48,585
roughly 10 minutes
of horse jokes.

958
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,253
Besides the audience
hating you

959
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,339
for the rest
of their lives.

960
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,424
It's for the next
couple minutes

961
00:43:54,466 --> 00:43:56,509
you will all be like,
"Is there a horse joke comin'?"

962
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,803
(audience laughs)

963
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:02,265
Or you're gonna be
like, "He coulda put a
horse joke in there.

964
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:03,767
"He didn't use the
reference 'giddy up.'

965
00:44:03,808 --> 00:44:06,394
Why wouldn't he
put it in there?"

966
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:09,481
But I want you to put
the horse jokes aside.

967
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,567
Put them in a barn.

968
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:14,527
And I'm gonna talk
about something else.

969
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:18,823
Maybe.

970
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:20,325
No, it's over.

971
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,203
I-- You know,
as I mentioned earlier

972
00:44:23,244 --> 00:44:24,829
I did some shows
in Europe and I only

973
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:28,625
bring that up to
try and impress you.

974
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,418
But I flew over.

975
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,963
Really the only way to
get across the Atlantic.

976
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,757
You rarely run into someone
who's like, "You know what?

977
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,927
I paddle boarded.
It was a great arm workout."

978
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:42,555
I flew over.
That transatlantic flight
wipes people out.

979
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,265
People are a mess.

980
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,851
They're like, "I need a day.
I need a day."

981
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:49,062
The flight doesn't
sound that hard.

982
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:50,522
It's like, "Oh, it was brutal.

983
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:53,400
"I had to sit and
watch two movies.

984
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:56,778
"I felt like I was
being water boarded.

985
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,405
I need a day."

986
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:01,991
I was flying back,
3,000 miles, seven hours.

987
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,660
We landed.
The guy sitting next to me

988
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:06,162
was like,
"That took too long."

989
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:11,000
It used to take six weeks,

990
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,128
on a boat,

991
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:16,256
if you survived.

992
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:17,924
That's how long it
took Columbus to get

993
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,927
from Spain to the western
hemisphere, six weeks.

994
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:22,887
But you know, once Columbus
got here he was like,

995
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,766
"I need a day.
I am so boat-lagged.

996
00:45:26,808 --> 00:45:28,059
"Give me a day and
I'll get right down

997
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:30,854
to murdering
and plundering."

998
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:34,482
"Jim don't bring up Columbus,
you're too white."

999
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:36,651
But Columbus, that's part
of our history right?

1000
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,111
Columbus ushered
in all these people

1001
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:40,029
that came to the
western hemisphere,

1002
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,865
and some of them
did bad things.

1003
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:44,451
But humans have done bad
things throughout the world.

1004
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:47,078
Like in Australia the way
some of the settlers

1005
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,038
treated the aboriginals,
it was not nice.

1006
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,166
It was not a g'day.

1007
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,168
(audience laughs)

1008
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:56,045
In fact it was a series
of bad days or bidet's.

1009
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,047
(audience laughs)

1010
00:45:58,089 --> 00:46:00,717
In New Zealand,
the settlers shared

1011
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:02,802
the land with the native
people, the Maori people,

1012
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,013
a very noble
warrior-like people,

1013
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,056
but the Maori weren't even the
first people in New Zealand.

1014
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,309
The first people in New
Zealand were the Moriori

1015
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:13,146
and then the Maori
came and ate them.

1016
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,732
Not even makin' that up.

1017
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,525
That's the most
intimidating thing

1018
00:46:17,567 --> 00:46:19,986
you could do to
your enemy, right?

1019
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,571
Like, "Oh, you're
gonna kill me?"

1020
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:23,823
"Yeah, and then I'm gonna
grab some mayonnaise."

1021
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,992
(audience laughs)

1022
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:28,786
"What are you gonna d-- Oh!"

1023
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:32,123
Could you imagine those initial
English settlers in New Zealand?

1024
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,501
'Cause the British
had conquered the world.

1025
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,919
They had colonies
on every continent

1026
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,545
so by the time they
got to New Zealand

1027
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,005
they were like,
"We've done this before.

1028
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:40,965
Let's meet with the
locals and take over."

1029
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:42,926
So they met with the Maori
and they're like,

1030
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,844
"So what happened to
these Moriori people,
did you kill them?"

1031
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,971
And they're like,
"Yeah, and then we ate them."

1032
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,765
The English were like,
"We were thinkin'

1033
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,893
"we could share the islands.

1034
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:54,646
"You wanna share?
You're not hungry now are you?

1035
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,272
"You know what?
Get 'em some shepherds pie.

1036
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,233
Tell 'em it's made
out of shepherds."

1037
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:01,194
(audience laughs)

1038
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:04,447
"Jim even makes
colonialism about eating."

1039
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:05,865
(audience laughs)

1040
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,494
They were cannibals.
By the way,

1041
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:12,288
at one time, all human
civilizations were cannibal,

1042
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,374
which means back then it
meant something different

1043
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:17,377
when someone said,
"I'm craving Indian or Thai."

1044
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:21,005
(audience laughs)

1045
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:26,594
I can see how you
wanna be offended,
but there's no reason.

1046
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,054
When I was in Europe,
I tried all

1047
00:47:28,096 --> 00:47:29,973
the local specialties,
you know?

1048
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,808
Norway, I tried
reindeer meat.

1049
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,435
I was in a Norwegian
butcher shop in January,

1050
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,312
and they had a sale
on reindeer meat,

1051
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,856
and nothing says
Christmas season is over,

1052
00:47:38,898 --> 00:47:41,776
(audience laughs)

1053
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:44,821
quite like a sale
on reindeer meat.

1054
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:48,324
It's gotta be a
tough day for Santa.

1055
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,743
"I wanna thank all you reindeer
who helped this Christmas.

1056
00:47:50,785 --> 00:47:54,581
"Great job.
Now when I call your name,

1057
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,833
come with me into
the smokehouse."

1058
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,669
(audience laughs)

1059
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:01,462
France, I ate so much cheese.

1060
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:03,590
So much delicious
French cheese,

1061
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:06,342
and I feel like I'm
still digesting it.

1062
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,305
My delicate American body
couldn't handle
the French cheese.

1063
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,390
And it's not like
I don't eat cheese.

1064
00:48:12,432 --> 00:48:15,768
Most of you are looking at me
like, "We think you eat cheese.

1065
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,272
We think you might
only eat cheese."

1066
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:22,025
But the French, they eat
cheese on a whole other level.

1067
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:23,776
In France,
they make eating cheese

1068
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,612
an official course
of the meal.

1069
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,322
So you'll eat an appetizer,

1070
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:29,449
then you'll eat an entree,
then for no reason at all

1071
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,744
you eat a bunch of
chunks of cheese,

1072
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:33,995
then you eat dessert.

1073
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:37,040
After that,
you go to the hospital.

1074
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:39,959
And of course, I've eaten
chunks of cheese before,

1075
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,378
just not in public.

1076
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,173
Or with pants on.

1077
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:46,966
Eating chunks of cheese,

1078
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,260
that's something I'm
usually caught doing.

1079
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:50,887
My wife's like, "What
the hell are you doin'?"

1080
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,057
"Nothing honey!"

1081
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,851
I remember the first time
I had the cheese course,

1082
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,936
I'd eaten an appetizer,
I'd eaten my entree

1083
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,480
and I started eating
my cheese course,

1084
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:04,484
and I heard my heart
say, "Are you mad at me?

1085
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,070
Did I do something
to anger you?"

1086
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:08,780
My brain took over.
"It's all right,
it's all right.

1087
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:11,115
"There's gonna be
some sweating.

1088
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,576
"Bowels, you can take
a couple weeks off.

1089
00:49:13,618 --> 00:49:15,244
Appendix, get ready to blow."

1090
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,704
(audience laughs)

1091
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:19,207
Tried so many delicious
French cheeses,

1092
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,501
and I couldn't tell you
the name of one of them.

1093
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,252
And they would
tell me the names.

1094
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,797
They're like, "This is
(imitating French).

1095
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,299
From the
(imitating French) region."

1096
00:49:28,341 --> 00:49:31,469
And I'd be like,
"So not cheddar?

1097
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:32,887
"'Cause I tried cheddar.

1098
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:35,765
"You guys get cheddar
over here yet?

1099
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:38,559
I like me some cheddar."

1100
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:41,354
Some of the French cheeses
I tried were goat cheese,

1101
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:44,565
or as the goats
call it, cheese.

1102
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:48,444
They're not caught up
in your cow cheese bias.

1103
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:51,739
You know, when I see cheese
I don't even see an animal.

1104
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:54,701
I just see something
my body can't process.

1105
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:58,204
(audience laughs)

1106
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,915
I like goat cheese. I'd never
looked at a goat and thought,

1107
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,792
"I bet that would
make good cheese."

1108
00:50:02,834 --> 00:50:04,669
(audience laughs)

1109
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:06,421
How do we even get to
the point of goat cheese?

1110
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:08,715
Was someone like,
"This cow cheese is good,

1111
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:11,718
but see that dog that
looks like it smokes meth?"

1112
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:16,681
(audience cheering,
applauding)

1113
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,852
"Can someone try and milk it?

1114
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:21,936
"I got a hunch it
would make cheese

1115
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:24,188
that would great with beets."

1116
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,524
(audience laughs)

1117
00:50:26,566 --> 00:50:29,152
Those Europeans, they have
a different approach to dairy.

1118
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,695
When they make a
sandwich in Europe

1119
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:32,321
they put butter
on their bread,

1120
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,198
they put butter on the bread,
and then mayonnaise.

1121
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,992
Ugh.

1122
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,036
That's like putting on
contacts and glasses.

1123
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,247
(audience laughs)

1124
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,582
Butter on the bread
of a sandwich?

1125
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:44,250
That actually sounds
like something Americans

1126
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:47,503
would do that Europeans
would criticize us for.

1127
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:50,214
"Those American pigs,
when they make a sandwich,

1128
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,467
"they put butter on the bread.

1129
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:55,261
No wonder they fat pig."

1130
00:50:55,303 --> 00:50:57,930
That's a good impression
of absolutely every European.

1131
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:02,018
(audience laughs)

1132
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,394
I did love doing
shows over there.

1133
00:51:03,436 --> 00:51:05,438
You never knew what
was gonna work.

1134
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,939
Sometimes there's
a language barrier.

1135
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,733
There's different references.

1136
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,193
There's famous people
in other countries

1137
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,611
we've never heard of.

1138
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:13,613
I was doing this show
in Ireland before.

1139
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,239
I was doing the sound check
before the show,

1140
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,532
and the sound guy was like,

1141
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,868
"Do you have any
special requests?"

1142
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,953
And I jokingly said, "Well,
I'll probably close my show

1143
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,122
by singing Raglan Road,"

1144
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:24,457
which is a famous
Irish folk song

1145
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:26,542
based on a famous Irish poem

1146
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:30,338
and the sound guy was like,
"Ooh, I don't recommend that."

1147
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,799
And I was like,
"Well, I was kidding but why?"

1148
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,218
And he goes, "Well recently
Billy Joelle did that."

1149
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:37,470
And I was like,
"Who's Billy Joelle?"

1150
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:39,472
(audience laughs)

1151
00:51:39,514 --> 00:51:42,892
And he goes, "You don't
know who Billy Joelle is?"

1152
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:45,478
I was like, "I'm from
another country,

1153
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,479
"I don't know
who's famous here.

1154
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,939
"What is it,
Superman's dad?

1155
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,982
I don't know."

1156
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,194
He goes, "Billy Joelle
is from America.

1157
00:51:53,236 --> 00:51:55,279
And I was like,
"Oh my gosh, there's
an American who's famous

1158
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:58,991
in Ireland that
I've never heard of."

1159
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:03,496
He goes, "Billy Joelle,
Piano Man. Uptown Girl."

1160
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:05,540
I was like,
"Oh, you mean Billy Joel."

1161
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:07,458
(audience laughs)

1162
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,086
He goes,
"No, it's Billy Joelle."

1163
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,047
For a second I thought,
"Maybe he's right."

1164
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:15,341
(audience laughs)

1165
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,470
This wouldn't be the
first time I discovered

1166
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:23,558
I mispronounced someone's
name for my entire life.

1167
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,351
In my mind I started
going through

1168
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,103
every conversation
I had on Billy Joel.

1169
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:29,981
I'm like, "Did anybody
else say Billy Joelle?

1170
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:34,277
When I said Billy Joel,
did anyone look at me strange?"

1171
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,487
Then I remember, you know
who pronounces it Billy Joel?

1172
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:38,781
Billy Joel.

1173
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:41,158
And at that point
the opening act had come in,

1174
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,035
and he was also from Ireland,
and I said,

1175
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,121
"Hey, this sound guys
calls Billy Joel Billy Joelle.

1176
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:49,041
And the Irish comic
goes, "It is Billy Joelle."

1177
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,461
I was like, "Is everyone
crazy in this country?

1178
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:54,589
What, there's no one
in Ireland named Joel?"

1179
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:57,758
And he goes, "Yeah,
we call them Joelle."

1180
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,760
I was like, "Well then,
what would you call someone

1181
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,554
who's actually named Joelle?"

1182
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:05,558
He goes, "You mean
like Billy Joelle?"

1183
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,020
Stop it.

1184
00:53:09,061 --> 00:53:10,354
No.

1185
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:11,981
I loved Ireland.

1186
00:53:12,023 --> 00:53:13,316
I spent two weeks there.

1187
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,151
One of the weeks,
I was in Donegal,

1188
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,862
which is a county in
the northwestern part of
the Republic,

1189
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,614
and I had noticed something.

1190
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,866
Everyone in Donegal
has a washer and dryer,

1191
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:24,201
but nobody uses their dryer.

1192
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:26,495
They're like,
"That won't be necessary.

1193
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,206
We'll just
hang that out to dry."

1194
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,042
And I was kinda skeptical,
but I was staying with friends,

1195
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,668
and they offered
to do my laundry,

1196
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,128
so they took my clothes
and they washed it,

1197
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:35,922
and they hung it out to dry,

1198
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:38,716
and I was kind of impressed
'cause after only three days...

1199
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:41,344
(audience laughs)

1200
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:42,970
my clothes were still wet.

1201
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:45,264
(audience laughs)

1202
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,599
'Cause what they've
yet to realize

1203
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,477
is it rains every
day in Donegal.

1204
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:52,438
It's like living in a shower.

1205
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,857
But my friend, she was so
proud of the line drying,

1206
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,734
she goes,
"Isn't that just better?

1207
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:59,028
Doesn't that smell glorious?"

1208
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,740
Meanwhile I'm holding
a wet tee shirt.

1209
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:04,200
"Yeah, this is great.

1210
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:08,579
I can just pretend
I got off a log ride."

1211
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,374
"There's nothing better than
waking up on a cold morning

1212
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:14,085
and putting on a wet
Billy Joelle tee shirt."

1213
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,128
(audience laughs)

1214
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:20,424
(audience cheering,
applauding)

1215
00:54:24,095 --> 00:54:25,680
My kids were with
me in Amsterdam.

1216
00:54:25,721 --> 00:54:27,306
I brought my kids to
the Anne Frank house.

1217
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,266
I told some friends that
and they were like,

1218
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,477
"Aren't your kids
a little young for
the Anne Frank house?"

1219
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:35,147
And you know what I learned?
They are. They're too young.

1220
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,816
But I wanted to
bring them, you know?

1221
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:38,693
It's an important place
I want them to learn.

1222
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:40,778
So I brought them.
We were standing outside
the Anne Frank house,

1223
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,447
and I said, "This is a
special somber place.

1224
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,117
"This is where Anne Frank,
her family and some friends

1225
00:54:46,158 --> 00:54:47,952
"hid from the Nazis
for two years,

1226
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,495
"and they couldn't
speak during the day,

1227
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,288
"and Anne also
wrote this diary.

1228
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:52,415
So let's be respectful."

1229
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,916
My six year old
raises his hand

1230
00:54:53,958 --> 00:54:56,335
and he goes, "Do they
have video games here?"

1231
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:57,837
(audience laughs)

1232
00:54:57,878 --> 00:55:01,382
And I said, "I'm gonna
need you to be quiet,

1233
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,342
for the rest of your life."

1234
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:05,136
(audience laughs)

1235
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,138
I bought tickets online
to the Anne Frank house.

1236
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,931
I Googled it.

1237
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,975
The Anne Frank house
has a Google rating

1238
00:55:11,017 --> 00:55:14,812
of 4.4 out of five stars.

1239
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:19,442
Who's giving the Anne
Frank house a bad review?

1240
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,736
(audience laughs)

1241
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:24,488
It's like, "Yeah,
it wasn't that fun.

1242
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,408
It was kind of crowded,
and there were no video games."

1243
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:29,368
(audience laughs)

1244
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:32,663
Why do we feel the need
to review everything?

1245
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:36,500
Nobody's going to Anne Frank's
house looking for hot dogs.

1246
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:41,088
"Well, I misread it. I thought
it was Anne's Frank house.

1247
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:44,383
I was gettin' ready to
have me an Amsterdam dog."

1248
00:55:44,425 --> 00:55:46,135
(audience laughs)

1249
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:47,678
When I travel with my kids,

1250
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,264
we always try to do one
educational thing a day.

1251
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:53,434
It usually involves going to
a museum, and museums are great,

1252
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:55,770
they're important, but
they're also exhausting, right?

1253
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:58,064
Acting like you're
interested in that crap.

1254
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,357
(audience laughs)

1255
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:03,694
There's so much pressure
to be impressed in a museum.

1256
00:56:03,736 --> 00:56:05,613
It's like "Ooh,
look at that kids.

1257
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:08,074
"Wow, that's a, well
that's a water fountain.

1258
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,743
What do we got over here?"

1259
00:56:10,785 --> 00:56:12,828
And I've been to all
kinds of museums.

1260
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,830
I've been to
children's museums,

1261
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,374
which are really just
museums of diseases

1262
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:20,503
your kids can get from
other peoples kids.

1263
00:56:20,544 --> 00:56:22,046
It's like, "Why don't
you go over there

1264
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:25,174
and see if we get
the chicken pox."

1265
00:56:25,216 --> 00:56:28,427
In Stockholm, I brought
my kids to a ship museum,

1266
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:32,556
the Vasa Museum.
It was a ship museum,
but it only had one ship,

1267
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:35,643
so it felt more
like a ship garage.

1268
00:56:35,684 --> 00:56:37,895
But that one ship,
the Vasa ship,

1269
00:56:37,937 --> 00:56:42,149
sunk on its maiden voyage
in Stockholm's harbor
in the 1700's,

1270
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:45,319
which is not good,
but that's the largest
attraction in Sweden.

1271
00:56:45,361 --> 00:56:47,238
Most countries,
their big attraction

1272
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,907
is a design marvel like
the Sydney Opera House

1273
00:56:49,949 --> 00:56:52,159
or the Eiffel Tower,
but Sweden was like,

1274
00:56:52,201 --> 00:56:54,411
"Here's our boat
that didn't float."

1275
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:57,248
(audience laughs)

1276
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,250
"This is why
we make furniture."

1277
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:02,753
(audience laughs)

1278
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,922
"That, ironically, floats."

1279
00:57:04,964 --> 00:57:07,591
(audience laughs)

1280
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,844
Often the museums
are art museums.

1281
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,012
Those are the most
intimidating, right?

1282
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:15,141
'Cause in art museums, they
tell us what is the good art.

1283
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,560
We have no say in the matter.
"That's good art."

1284
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:22,398
"Oh, okay.
I'll take your word for it."

1285
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,316
They treat everyone like
a child in an art museum.

1286
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:25,401
They're like,
"Don't touch anything.

1287
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:26,777
Nobody touch anything."

1288
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:29,572
I wasn't gonna.

1289
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,739
Now I kinda want to.

1290
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,700
(audience laughs)

1291
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,993
Everyone's speaking
in hushed tones.

1292
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,369
"Be respectful.

1293
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,622
"We're about to look at
the work of a mad man.

1294
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:42,042
He painted this after he
chopped off his own ear."

1295
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:45,462
"Why are we whispering?
Van Gogh's dead.

1296
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,965
Even if he was alive,
he couldn't hear us."

1297
00:57:48,007 --> 00:57:50,342
(audience laughs)

1298
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,094
Recently after a show,
someone came up to me.

1299
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,054
They're like you know,
it's not pronounced Van Gogh,

1300
00:57:54,096 --> 00:57:56,098
it's pronounced
Billy Joelle.

1301
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,309
(audience laughs)

1302
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:02,646
(audience cheering,
applauding)

1303
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:07,693
I do find it hard
to leave art museums,

1304
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:10,237
mainly 'cause I
can't find the exit.

1305
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:11,989
Great, another room filled

1306
00:58:12,031 --> 00:58:14,867
with paintings of
ugly Dutch people.

1307
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:19,580
In the 1600's they painted
every ugly Dutch person.

1308
00:58:19,622 --> 00:58:21,832
"Hey, you're hard to look at.
Can I do your portrait?"

1309
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:25,211
(audience laughs)

1310
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:26,921
"Makin' that hay
look good aren't ya?"

1311
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,839
(audience laughs)

1312
00:58:28,881 --> 00:58:32,218
Fine art, sometimes I feel
like it's wasted on me.

1313
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:33,344
You know like the Mona Lisa?

1314
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,012
We've all seen the Mona Lisa.

1315
00:58:35,054 --> 00:58:37,765
The most beautiful
smile in the world.

1316
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:39,350
The most beautiful smile.

1317
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,268
I'm like, "Have you
seen Halle Berry?"

1318
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:42,853
(audience laughs)

1319
00:58:42,895 --> 00:58:44,355
Heck, have you
seen Chuck Berry?

1320
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:45,648
(audience laughs)

1321
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,359
I don't even know
if Mona Lisa's smiling.

1322
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,694
To me it looks like she's,
just came from the dentist.

1323
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,695
She's like, "Mmm."

1324
00:58:51,737 --> 00:58:53,864
(audience laughs)

1325
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:56,992
"Novocain's wearin' off."

1326
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,578
Art museums will
occasionally ask

1327
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:01,205
if you'd like to
become a member.

1328
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,831
"Would you like to
become a member?"

1329
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:07,253
"Uh, how, how often would
I have to come here?"

1330
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,964
(audience laughs)

1331
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:15,552
I think I can only pretend
to be interested once.

1332
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:18,013
There's always people
sketching in an art museum.

1333
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,306
I always point them
out to security.

1334
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,600
I'm like, "Copying."

1335
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:26,438
Got a forgery
happening mid forge.

1336
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,317
Those art museum security guards
you know, they're important.

1337
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:33,237
Some of that art is priceless.
Some of it's on loan.

1338
00:59:33,279 --> 00:59:34,238
You see that next to a painting.

1339
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,491
On loan from a rich person.

1340
00:59:37,533 --> 00:59:41,495
"The poor people
may look at my art.

1341
00:59:41,537 --> 00:59:44,707
But don't let them get their
peasant fingers on it."

1342
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,501
(audience laughs)

1343
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,336
Some of that art is priceless.

1344
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:54,133
Recently, a Da Vinci painting
sold for $450 million.

1345
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:58,220
400-- What room do you
put that in your house?

1346
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:00,848
"I put that in the game room."

1347
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,975
It was a Da Vinci
painting, Salvator Mundi.

1348
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:04,935
It was a painting of Jesus,

1349
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:07,938
but it's not like Da Vinci even
knew what Jesus looked like.

1350
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,983
He painted it 1500 years
after Jesus walked the earth.

1351
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:12,776
So he was just guessing.
He's like, "I don't know.

1352
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:14,695
He's got brown eyes probably?
I don't know."

1353
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:15,988
(audience laughs)

1354
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:20,117
He probably just
painted someone he knew.

1355
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:21,827
You know back in
the day they're like,

1356
01:00:21,869 --> 01:00:24,038
people are like, "What,
is that your nephew Eddie?"

1357
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:26,707
Da Vinci's like,
"No, that's Jesus.

1358
01:00:26,749 --> 01:00:28,375
(audience laughs)

1359
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,878
The savior of the world."

1360
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,504
(audience laughs)

1361
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:36,925
"Eddie is wearing
the same outfit as him."

1362
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,469
"That's a coincidence."

1363
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:41,263
(audience laughs)

1364
01:00:42,723 --> 01:00:44,767
So many paintings
of Jesus right?

1365
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,145
But there's really two
types of paintings of Jesus.

1366
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:51,857
There's Jesus as an adult,
or Jesus as a baby.

1367
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:54,777
There's no teenage Jesus.

1368
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:58,947
There's no acne Jesus,

1369
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,075
with the beginning
of a mustache.

1370
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,910
(audience laughs)

1371
01:01:02,951 --> 01:01:06,288
"Jim, you're going
to Hell for that."

1372
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:10,125
And you sound
so dumb right now.

1373
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,669
That is my worst fear is to
come across like an idiot,

1374
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:14,463
and you guys are like,
"You should be terrified then."

1375
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:16,382
(audience laughs)

1376
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:18,675
I mostly get nervous
when I'm talking to
really smart people.

1377
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,260
You ever been
talking to someone,

1378
01:01:20,302 --> 01:01:24,139
and you hear yourself
not make sense?

1379
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,810
But instead of stopping,
you just keep talkin'?

1380
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,980
"You know what? I'll pull it
together at the end.

1381
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:35,609
Oops, that might
not have been a word."

1382
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:38,362
That's usually the moment
where I make eye contact
with my wife.

1383
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:40,739
She's like, "What the hell
are you doing?"

1384
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:44,201
"I'm trying to
make you look good."

1385
01:01:44,243 --> 01:01:46,245
Here's how dumb I am.

1386
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:48,372
When someone's criticized
on social media

1387
01:01:48,414 --> 01:01:51,375
for being stupid,
I get nervous.

1388
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:55,045
Like, "Oh, they're comin'
for all us dummies.

1389
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:59,258
Probably gonna start with a
spellin' test or somethin'."

1390
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:01,635
(Jim chuckles)

1391
01:02:01,677 --> 01:02:04,388
The kids aren't with me,
but if we're really quiet

1392
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,223
we can hear them screaming
in New York City.

1393
01:02:06,265 --> 01:02:07,891
(audience laughs)

1394
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,726
When I travel
without my children,

1395
01:02:09,768 --> 01:02:11,270
in between those
moments of guilt,

1396
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,647
are just hours of happiness.

1397
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:15,482
(audience laughs)

1398
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:18,652
(audience cheering,
applauding)

1399
01:02:20,821 --> 01:02:22,739
I mean, I love my kids.

1400
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,867
I just love them more
when I'm not with them.

1401
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,952
(audience laughs)

1402
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:29,329
And when I travel without
my kids, I do nothing.

1403
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,081
I'm so productive when
I travel with them.

1404
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:33,125
When they're not here,
I do nothing,

1405
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:35,043
and then I'll do nothing
all day and then

1406
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,962
I'll call home
and my saintly wife

1407
01:02:37,004 --> 01:02:38,755
will just pick up the phone,

1408
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,091
and there'll be chaos
in the background.

1409
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:42,468
And she'll be like,
"What'd you do today?"

1410
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,511
And I'll be like,
"What'd I do?

1411
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:47,764
"Well, I got up.

1412
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,100
Did that a couple times."

1413
01:02:50,142 --> 01:02:51,768
(audience laughs)

1414
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,355
"Enough about me.
What about you?"

1415
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:57,024
And she'll put my
kids on the phone.

1416
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,317
They'll be like,
"Third grade's hard,"

1417
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:01,612
and I'll be like,
"It gets so much worse."

1418
01:03:01,653 --> 01:03:03,238
School is hard you know?

1419
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,032
I try and be supportive
in the morning.

1420
01:03:05,073 --> 01:03:07,242
I'll be like, "Look,
I know you don't wanna go,

1421
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:11,830
"but just remember, I never
have to go to school again.

1422
01:03:11,872 --> 01:03:14,041
Anyway, off you go.
I'm gonna nap."

1423
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,584
(audience laughs)

1424
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,713
I don't know.
I wouldn't wanna be a kid.

1425
01:03:19,755 --> 01:03:20,923
I like the age I am.

1426
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:22,174
I wouldn't
wanna be a teenager.

1427
01:03:22,216 --> 01:03:23,467
I wouldn't wanna be
in my 20's.

1428
01:03:23,509 --> 01:03:25,469
I like being 30 years old.

1429
01:03:25,511 --> 01:03:29,598
(audience laughs)

1430
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,726
I try and schedule tours
around school breaks, you know?

1431
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,729
Like at Christmas one year,
I did a bunch of shows
in Florida,

1432
01:03:35,771 --> 01:03:37,314
and my wife
and kids came down.

1433
01:03:37,356 --> 01:03:38,815
My wife's family
also came down

1434
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,026
'cause they didn't want
us to have a good time.

1435
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:43,820
(audience laughs)

1436
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,448
I'm kidding.
I love my wife's family.

1437
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:49,826
Did that sound believable?

1438
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:50,953
I do love them.

1439
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,412
They're my in-laws.

1440
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,373
That's a strange term,
in-laws.

1441
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:58,168
"Are you related?"
"Uh, legally.

1442
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,421
In a court of law."

1443
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:03,549
In-law, it's like the
opposite of being in love.

1444
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,717
We're in law.

1445
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,512
We law each other.

1446
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:10,847
Very much.

1447
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:12,849
In-laws are like
family you're assigned.

1448
01:04:12,891 --> 01:04:14,351
It's like, "You wanna spend
your life with that person?

1449
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:17,312
You gotta take
those 10 people."

1450
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,107
"All of them?"

1451
01:04:20,148 --> 01:04:24,319
My only issue with my in-laws
is there's too many of them.

1452
01:04:24,361 --> 01:04:25,904
My wife is
one of nine children,

1453
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,782
so every holiday all
nine of the siblings

1454
01:04:28,824 --> 01:04:30,993
and their individual
families all

1455
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,830
get together and spend
every moment together.

1456
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:39,501
Over Christmas, I went to
a movie with 30 people.

1457
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:42,296
I didn't even know
that was legal.

1458
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,714
We were walkin' around,

1459
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:47,342
people thought we
were from a church.

1460
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:51,263
To put it in perspective Jesus
only walked around with 12.

1461
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:53,557
(audience laughs)

1462
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,018
I learned very
quickly I don't wanna

1463
01:04:56,059 --> 01:04:59,021
do anything with 30 people.

1464
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,106
If I was on the Titanic
and the last rescue boat

1465
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:04,484
was filled with 30 people,
I'd be like, "You guys go ahead.

1466
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:06,320
"I don't want to be
there when you try

1467
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,738
and decide
where to eat lunch."

1468
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:10,157
(audience laughs)

1469
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,492
Oh, but it was more
then 30 people,

1470
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,704
'cause sometimes those
30 people will invite
other people.

1471
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,581
So you'll have
conversations and someone

1472
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:20,334
will be like, "I'm your
wife's uncles best friend."

1473
01:05:20,375 --> 01:05:23,170
Oh, there's a term for that.
Stranger.

1474
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,547
(audience laughs)

1475
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,007
You're a total stranger.

1476
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:30,510
(audience cheering,
applauding)

1477
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:32,262
I do love my wife's parents.

1478
01:05:32,304 --> 01:05:33,889
Their names are
Louise and Dominic

1479
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,599
so I call them Louise and Dom.

1480
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:37,684
My wife's siblings, some
of them have gotten married

1481
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:39,853
and their spouses,
some of their spouses

1482
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:45,317
call Louise and Dom
Mom and Dad 'cause
they're weirdos.

1483
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,652
No, I understand.

1484
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:47,944
Sometimes you
marry into a family

1485
01:05:47,986 --> 01:05:49,655
and become so close
to the parents

1486
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:52,532
that you wanna call them
Mom and Dad, but don't.

1487
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,826
(audience laughs)

1488
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:59,039
It's weird and confusing
for the rest of us.

1489
01:05:59,081 --> 01:06:01,792
Wait, that's his mom?

1490
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,043
He married his sister?

1491
01:06:03,085 --> 01:06:05,587
(audience laughs)

1492
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,756
What state is he from?

1493
01:06:07,798 --> 01:06:09,800
(audience laughs)

1494
01:06:12,094 --> 01:06:14,179
This is, by the way
this is all prosthetic.

1495
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:16,098
(audience laughs)

1496
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,432
After the show it comes off.

1497
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,559
I just air it out
and it's like,

1498
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:23,480
I feel so free when I get
it off, you know what I mean?

1499
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:26,483
It's getting harder and harder
to motivate to exercise.

1500
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:29,569
In your 20's, you're like,
"I wanna be with someone
physically fit,

1501
01:06:29,611 --> 01:06:31,071
so I'll be physically fit,"
and in your 30's,

1502
01:06:31,113 --> 01:06:33,365
you're like,
"I wanna fight off aging,"

1503
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:35,325
and in your 40's
you're like, "It's over."

1504
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:37,828
(audience laughs)

1505
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:39,705
And now I'm at the
point where I look

1506
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:43,834
at morbidly obese people and
I'm like, "They seem happy."

1507
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:47,671
That's one way to live a life.

1508
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:50,298
I used to exercise
to lose weight.

1509
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:55,095
Now I exercise so I can
continue to fit in cars.

1510
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:57,431
It's still a fitness goal.

1511
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,392
(audience laughs)

1512
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:03,353
I've been in better
shape in my life.

1513
01:07:03,395 --> 01:07:05,105
I go in and out.
It's been awhile.

1514
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:06,773
Not last year but
the year before

1515
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:08,567
my big accomplishment is

1516
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,444
I ran the
New York City Marathon.

1517
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,487
-(audience applauds)
-Thank you.

1518
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:14,698
Thank you.
Thank you.

1519
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:18,034
Half of you are,
like, "No, you didn't."

1520
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:20,454
I did, you bastards,
all right?

1521
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:23,707
I ran and completed.
All right, fine, I didn't.

1522
01:07:23,749 --> 01:07:25,792
(audience laughs)

1523
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:28,378
But I thought about it.

1524
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:31,631
Which I guess is technically
different then running it.

1525
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:33,508
It turns out I couldn't run

1526
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:37,637
the New York City Marathon
'cause I didn't want to.

1527
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,307
Which is the main reason
I don't do a lotta things.

1528
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,392
I just rarely admit it.

1529
01:07:42,434 --> 01:07:44,478
It's like, "Hey, Jim,
why didn't you come
to my birthday party?"

1530
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:47,397
"I didn't want to."

1531
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,900
We never really reply
to invitations that way.

1532
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,820
"Don't wanna go.

1533
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:56,656
Completely available,
just not interested."

1534
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:59,534
(audience laughs)

1535
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:02,162
"Really wish I wasn't there,
so I won't be."

1536
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:04,372
(audience laughs)

1537
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:06,833
I know people who have run
the New York City Marathon.

1538
01:08:06,875 --> 01:08:08,543
They always bring it up.

1539
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,170
They're like, "Yeah, I ran
the New York City Marathon."

1540
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:12,881
I always ask, "Did you win?"

1541
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:14,549
"No, but I finished."

1542
01:08:14,591 --> 01:08:16,885
"What place you come at?"
"I don't know."

1543
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:20,263
"Sounds like
you came in last."

1544
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:24,935
"Really what you're saying
is you lost the New York
City Marathon."

1545
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:26,394
"If I were you I
wouldn't bring that up."

1546
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,979
(audience laughs)

1547
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,315
But that's why some
people run marathons

1548
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:32,776
so that they can say,
"I ran a marathon."

1549
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:36,238
Which to me is not
a good enough reason.

1550
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,948
Heck, I can say
I ran a marathon.

1551
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,826
In fact, earlier I did.

1552
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:43,036
It didn't feel good,
it felt dishonest.

1553
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:47,791
I guess what I'm trying to say
is marathon runners are liars.

1554
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,126
All of them.

1555
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,003
It's too far.
It's way too far.

1556
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,508
26.2 miles, that's too far
to run, jog or frankly drive.

1557
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,677
Let's be serious.

1558
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:00,554
But you know what?
I'm not a runner.

1559
01:09:00,595 --> 01:09:01,721
I'm not a runner.
Half of you are like,

1560
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,974
"We never thought you were.

1561
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:06,393
At this point we're not
sure if you're a walker."

1562
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,478
But running is huge right?

1563
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,230
There are stores
just for runners.

1564
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:11,982
There's magazines
dedicated to running.

1565
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,401
"Runners World," a magazine
all about running,

1566
01:09:14,442 --> 01:09:16,444
and if you thought
running was boring,

1567
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,822
wait 'til you read
about running.

1568
01:09:18,864 --> 01:09:21,658
(audience laughs)

1569
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,494
At this point,
is there any information

1570
01:09:24,536 --> 01:09:27,831
we don't have on running?

1571
01:09:27,873 --> 01:09:31,960
Oh, you're supposed to use
your arms when you run.

1572
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:36,006
What? I think I've been
runnin' backwards.

1573
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,300
No wonder I keep losin'.

1574
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,886
(audience laughs)

1575
01:09:40,927 --> 01:09:41,928
The runners high.

1576
01:09:41,970 --> 01:09:44,180
I'm sure that's not a myth.

1577
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:50,353
Let me get this right.
You're confusing
exhaustion for high?

1578
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:53,106
Have you ever
been high before?

1579
01:09:53,148 --> 01:09:57,986
How can you confuse,
"I can't breathe" with "Joy?"

1580
01:09:58,028 --> 01:10:00,322
(audience laughs)

1581
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,741
The runner's high.

1582
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:04,659
Has anyone ever used
that as an excuse?

1583
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:08,663
Sorry I ate all the chips.
Runner's high.

1584
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,165
Hey, I ran a 10K
in high school.

1585
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:12,834
I think I'm still high.

1586
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,462
But there's running, and then
there's running a marathon.

1587
01:10:15,503 --> 01:10:19,299
You know you have to
pay to run a marathon?

1588
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:21,426
What?

1589
01:10:21,468 --> 01:10:23,053
For the New York City Marathon

1590
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,221
you have to pay $250

1591
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:31,227
to run by yourself 26 miles.

1592
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:35,482
That's some
S&M stuff there.

1593
01:10:35,523 --> 01:10:36,942
That's like the subplot of

1594
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,027
a "Law & Order:
Special Victims Unit."

1595
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:41,321
You gotta pay that up front.

1596
01:10:41,363 --> 01:10:42,989
It's not like there's
a toll system.

1597
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,366
Like we're on 13 mile.

1598
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:47,869
What is this a chip reader?

1599
01:10:47,911 --> 01:10:49,704
You ever see the
beginning of a marathon?

1600
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,290
All there runners line up in
their voluntary prison number?

1601
01:10:52,332 --> 01:10:54,209
(audience laughs)

1602
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,545
And then someone
shoots a gun. Red flag.

1603
01:10:57,587 --> 01:11:01,174
And the runners disperse
like Godzilla's approaching.

1604
01:11:01,216 --> 01:11:03,134
Ah!

1605
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:07,097
Why is there a weapon
involved in a foot race?

1606
01:11:07,138 --> 01:11:11,017
Whatever happened to
someone saying "go?"

1607
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:13,520
All right let's review how
we're gonna start the marathon.

1608
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,522
We'll get all the
lemmings lined up there

1609
01:11:15,563 --> 01:11:18,733
and then without any warning,
Cooter will shoot his .357.

1610
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,194
(audience laughs)

1611
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:24,280
In the air this time, Cooter.

1612
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,574
Then we'll just sit
back, count the money

1613
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:29,202
and watch some of
them soil themselves.

1614
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:30,745
(audience laughs)

1615
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:34,207
(audience cheering,
applauding)

1616
01:11:38,336 --> 01:11:41,214
You ever see the
winner of a marathon?

1617
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,550
They do not look healthy.

1618
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:47,178
They look like they were
forced to run a marathon.

1619
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,098
Like it was some negotiation
as part of ransom.

1620
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:51,474
I finished, I finished!

1621
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,436
Now can I have my children?

1622
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:57,022
I ran 26 miles,
I drank my own urine,

1623
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:59,065
I'm wearing
a tin foil blanket.

1624
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:02,318
What's going on
with my kids?

1625
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,738
Of course I respect
people who run marathons.

1626
01:12:04,779 --> 01:12:06,031
Heck, I'm impressed
by the people

1627
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,700
who pass out
water at marathons.

1628
01:12:08,742 --> 01:12:11,828
I always look at them,
I'm like, I couldn't do that.

1629
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:16,708
Probably gotta get up early,
then you gotta find cups.

1630
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:20,211
Then there's passin'
out all that water.

1631
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,840
My arm's just sore
thinkin' about it.

1632
01:12:23,882 --> 01:12:26,176
At least those people are doing
something at the marathon.

1633
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,219
You ever see the rest of the
people watchin' the marathon?

1634
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,346
They're like.

1635
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:32,057
(audience laughs)

1636
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:40,065
What is going on
in your life,

1637
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:44,778
if you're watching
strangers run a marathon?

1638
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,654
(audience laughs)

1639
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:51,743
I suppose some of them are
there supporting friends.

1640
01:12:51,785 --> 01:12:53,328
I wouldn't want that.

1641
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:58,083
I don't even want someone
to see me in a hurry.

1642
01:12:58,124 --> 01:13:01,127
That seems like a big
request of a friend, right?

1643
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:05,048
"Hey, can you watch
me run 26 miles?

1644
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:08,259
Only take your entire Sunday."

1645
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,096
You can only watch someone
run part of a marathon.

1646
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,597
It's not that big
of a commitment.

1647
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:14,265
It's like, "You can do it,
you can do it!

1648
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:15,600
All right,
I'm goin' to brunch."

1649
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:18,645
(audience laughs)

1650
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:21,064
But you could watch
someone run a marathon.

1651
01:13:21,106 --> 01:13:22,440
You can't go into
a health club

1652
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:25,401
and watch someone
on a treadmill.

1653
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,986
(audience laughs)

1654
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,371
"Excuse me sir,
what are you doin'?"

1655
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,498
"I'm supportin' that lady."

1656
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:41,417
(audience laughs)

1657
01:13:41,459 --> 01:13:44,879
"Do you, uh,
do you know her?"

1658
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,881
"Not yet,

1659
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:51,678
but I brought her this
lock for the bridge."

1660
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:54,055
All right, that is all for me.
Thank you very much.

1661
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:55,431
(audience cheering,
applauding)

1662
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,267
This was so fun.
Thank you for coming.

1663
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,519
Appreciate it.

1664
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,193
(audience applauding,
cheering)
