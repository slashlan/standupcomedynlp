00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,880
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you very much.</font>

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,240
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.
Might've peaked a bit early, but...</font>

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,640
<font color="#ffff00">Welcome to my show.</font>

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,080
<font color="#ffff00">My show is called  Nanette.</font>

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,040
<font color="#ffff00">And the reason
my show is called  Nanette,</font>

13
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,920
<font color="#ffff00">is because I named it before I wrote it.</font>

14
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,720
<font color="#ffff00">I named it at around the time
I'd met a woman called Nanette...</font>

15
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
<font color="#ffff00">who I thought was very interesting.</font>

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,840
<font color="#ffff00">So interesting. "Nanette,"
I thought, "I reckon I can squeeze</font>

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,640
<font color="#ffff00">a good hour of laughs
out of you, Nanette, I reckon."</font>

18
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,760
<font color="#ffff00">But...</font>

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
<font color="#ffff00">turns out...</font>

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,000
<font color="#ffff00">no.</font>

21
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,200
<font color="#ffff00">I met her in a small-town café.</font>

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,200
<font color="#ffff00">Now, I feel... I don't feel comfortable
in a small town. I get a bit tense.</font>

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,680
<font color="#ffff00">Mainly because I am this situation.</font>

24
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,760
<font color="#ffff00">And in a small town,
that's all right from a distance.</font>

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,120
<font color="#ffff00">People are like, "Oh, good bloke!"
And then...</font>

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,800
<font color="#ffff00">get a bit closer and it's like, "Oh no!
Trickster woman, what are you doing?"</font>

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,600
<font color="#ffff00">I get a lot of side-eye.</font>

28
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,000
<font color="#ffff00">So I feel quite tense in a small town.</font>

29
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,360
<font color="#ffff00">Now, I'm from a small town,
a very small town in...</font>

30
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,560
<font color="#ffff00">I'm from Tasmania.</font>

31
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,000
<font color="#ffff00">Now, of course,
Tasmania is that little island</font>

32
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,400
<font color="#ffff00">floating off the... arse end</font>

33
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
<font color="#ffff00">of mainland Australia there, just...</font>

34
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,280
<font color="#ffff00">Lovely place.</font>

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
<font color="#ffff00">Famous for a lot of things.</font>

36
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
<font color="#ffff00">Potatoes. Very...</font>

37
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,200
<font color="#ffff00">And our frighteningly small gene pool.
That's...</font>

38
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,720
<font color="#ffff00">I wish I was joking.</font>

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,640
<font color="#ffff00">But I am very partial to the potato.</font>

40
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,640
<font color="#ffff00">Very versatile... vegetable.</font>

41
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,840
<font color="#ffff00">And not all the branches go directly
away from the trunk</font>

42
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,840
<font color="#ffff00">in our family tree, I will admit.</font>

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,120
<font color="#ffff00">It's a bit... topiary. But...</font>

44
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,920
<font color="#ffff00">I love Tasmania.</font>

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,640
<font color="#ffff00">I loved growing up there.
I felt right at home, I did.</font>

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,480
<font color="#ffff00">But I had to leave</font>

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,280
<font color="#ffff00">as soon as I found out
I was a little bit lesbian.</font>

48
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,240
<font color="#ffff00">And you do find out, don't you? Yeah.</font>

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,240
<font color="#ffff00">I got a letter.</font>

50
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,840
<font color="#ffff00">"Dear Sir/Madam."</font>

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,120
<font color="#ffff00">Wasn't a great letter to receive
in mid-'90s Tasmania.</font>

52
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,480
<font color="#ffff00">Because the wisdom of the day was
if you chose to be gay...</font>

53
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,120
<font color="#ffff00">I say "wisdom", even though
homosexuality's clearly not a choice.</font>

54
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,120
<font color="#ffff00">Wisdom is always relative, you know.</font>

55
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,280
<font color="#ffff00">And in a place like Tasmania,
everything's very relative, but I...</font>

56
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,760
<font color="#ffff00">But the wisdom of the day was that,
if you chose to be gay,</font>

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,280
<font color="#ffff00">then you should just get yourself
a one-way ticket to the mainland,</font>

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,760
<font color="#ffff00">and don't come back.</font>

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,120
<font color="#ffff00">Gays... why don't you just
pack your AIDS up into a suitcase there</font>

60
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
<font color="#ffff00">and fuck off to Mardi Gras?</font>

61
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,800
<font color="#ffff00">Because homosexuality was a crime</font>

62
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,920
<font color="#ffff00">in Tasmania 'til 1997.</font>

63
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,120
<font color="#ffff00">Not long enough ago.</font>

64
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,600
<font color="#ffff00">And I took a long time
to come to terms with my sexuality.</font>

65
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,360
<font color="#ffff00">There's a few reasons for that.</font>

66
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,080
<font color="#ffff00">A lot of it has to do with bad press.</font>

67
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,560
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, they didn't get a good rap when
I was growing up, the homosexuals.</font>

68
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,480
<font color="#ffff00">We didn't have social media
like we do now, but...</font>

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,680
<font color="#ffff00">"Letters to the Editor," let me tell you.</font>

70
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
<font color="#ffff00">Slow Twitter. Brutal.</font>

71
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,320
<font color="#ffff00">But in all the debate about...
homosexuality...</font>

72
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
<font color="#ffff00">no one ever really talked
about the lesbians.</font>

73
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,320
<font color="#ffff00">You know? It was all the gay men.
They're the problem!</font>

74
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,320
<font color="#ffff00">Anal sex.
That's when the devil will get you!</font>

75
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,520
<font color="#ffff00">But lesbians, they're like, "No...</font>

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,680
<font color="#ffff00">What even are they?
What they do, though, really?</font>

77
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,080
<font color="#ffff00">Do they even exist
if no one's watching, really?</font>

78
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,720
<font color="#ffff00">No, don't worry about them.
No harm in a cuddle."</font>

79
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,640
<font color="#ffff00">For a long time, I knew more facts
about unicorns than I did about lesbians.</font>

80
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,480
<font color="#ffff00">Another reason I struggled with--
There are no facts about unicorns.</font>

81
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,800
<font color="#ffff00">Another reason I struggled
to identify as gay was</font>

82
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,600
<font color="#ffff00">the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.
Precisely that.</font>

83
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,240
<font color="#ffff00">The Mardi Gras was my first introduction
to my people.</font>

84
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,080
<font color="#ffff00">I watched it on... my TV</font>

85
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,600
<font color="#ffff00">in my little living room in my small town.</font>

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,040
<font color="#ffff00">That was my first introduction
to my people. The Mardi Gras.</font>

87
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,960
<font color="#ffff00">My people...
flaunting their lifestyle in a parade!</font>

88
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,120
<font color="#ffff00">I used to watch it, going,
"There they are, my people.</font>

89
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,320
<font color="#ffff00">They're busy, aren't they?</font>

90
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,000
<font color="#ffff00">Gosh. Don't they love to dance and party?"</font>

91
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,400
<font color="#ffff00">I used to sit there and watch it and go,
"Where... where do the quiet gays... go?</font>

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,720
<font color="#ffff00">Where are the quiet gays supposed to go?"</font>

93
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,360
<font color="#ffff00">I still do.</font>

94
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,880
<font color="#ffff00">I'm just like...</font>

95
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,520
<font color="#ffff00">the pressure on my people</font>

96
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,440
<font color="#ffff00">to express our identity and pride
through the metaphor of party</font>

97
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,160
<font color="#ffff00">is very intense.</font>

98
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,360
<font color="#ffff00">Don't get me wrong, I love the spectacle,
I really do,</font>

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,640
<font color="#ffff00">but I've never felt compelled
to get amongst it.</font>

100
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,480
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know? I'm a quiet soul.</font>

101
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,080
<font color="#ffff00">My favorite sound in the whole world
is the sound of a teacup finding its place</font>

102
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,280
<font color="#ffff00">on a saucer.</font>

103
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,200
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, it's very, very difficult
to flaunt that lifestyle in a parade.</font>

104
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,840
<font color="#ffff00">I don't even like the flag.</font>

105
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,760
<font color="#ffff00">Controversial!</font>

106
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
<font color="#ffff00">But there, I've said it. Now...</font>

107
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,760
<font color="#ffff00">the Pride flag, now, I love what it means,
that is perfect.</font>

108
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,320
<font color="#ffff00">Pride. Wonderful.</font>

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,320
<font color="#ffff00">But the flag itself? Bit busy.</font>

110
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,600
<font color="#ffff00">It's just six very shouty,
assertive colors,</font>

111
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,480
<font color="#ffff00">stacked on top of each other,
no rest for the eye.</font>

112
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
<font color="#ffff00">An afternoon of that waving in my face,</font>

113
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,840
<font color="#ffff00">I need to express my identity
through the metaphor of a nap.</font>

114
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,960
<font color="#ffff00">I don't...</font>

115
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,280
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think I'm very good at gay.</font>

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,520
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not the only who thinks that. I've...</font>

117
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,880
<font color="#ffff00">I've been getting a bit of negative
feedback of late from my people,</font>

118
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,200
<font color="#ffff00">the lesbians.</font>

119
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,800
<font color="#ffff00">Bit of negative feedback.</font>

120
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,360
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause, gosh, don't my people
love the feedback. Not...</font>

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,320
<font color="#ffff00">Not shy!</font>

122
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,080
<font color="#ffff00">Not shy with the feedback.
One of our spokespeople last year...</font>

123
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,480
<font color="#ffff00">Self-appointed.</font>

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,280
<font color="#ffff00">One of our spokespeople approached me
straight after one of my shows</font>

125
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
<font color="#ffff00">to give me a bit of feedback,
and that's my favorite time for feedback.</font>

126
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,880
<font color="#ffff00">Straight after a show? Yes, please!</font>

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
<font color="#ffff00">That is when my skin is at its thickest.</font>

128
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,200
<font color="#ffff00">The feedback? Apparently, she said,</font>

129
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,440
<font color="#ffff00">"I was very disappointed in your show
this year, Hannah.</font>

130
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,920
<font color="#ffff00">I just don't think
there was enough lesbian content."</font>

131
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,280
<font color="#ffff00">I'd been on stage the whole time.</font>

132
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,080
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't... even straighten up
halfway through, you know?</font>

133
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,040
<font color="#ffff00">Perhaps I've been slacking off a bit.</font>

134
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,720
<font color="#ffff00">When I first started... the comedy,</font>

135
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,080
<font color="#ffff00">over a decade ago, always, nothing but.</font>

136
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,120
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing but lesbian content. Wall to wall.</font>

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,120
<font color="#ffff00">My first ever show...  was classic
new gay comic 101. My coming out story.</font>

138
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,840
<font color="#ffff00">I told lots of cool jokes
about homophobia.</font>

139
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,080
<font color="#ffff00">Really solved... that problem.</font>

140
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,640
<font color="#ffff00">Tick.</font>

141
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,920
<font color="#ffff00">I told... a story about the time
this young man had almost beaten me up</font>

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,080
<font color="#ffff00">because he thought...</font>

143
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,320
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, he thought I was
cracking on to his girlfriend.</font>

144
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,560
<font color="#ffff00">Actually, that bit was true,
got that right, but.... there was a twist.</font>

145
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,320
<font color="#ffff00">It happened late at night,
it was at the bus stop.</font>

146
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,760
<font color="#ffff00">The pub had closed,
it was the last bus home,</font>

147
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,600
<font color="#ffff00">and I was waiting at the bus stop.
And I was talking to a girl, and...</font>

148
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,880
<font color="#ffff00">you know, you could say flirting.
I don't know.</font>

149
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,880
<font color="#ffff00">And... out of nowhere, he just comes up
and starts shoving me, going,</font>

150
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,640
<font color="#ffff00">"Fuck off, you fucking faggot!"</font>

151
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,200
<font color="#ffff00">And he goes, "Keep away
from my girlfriend, you fucking freak!"</font>

152
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:38,560
<font color="#ffff00">And she's just stepped in, going,
"Whoa, stop it! It's a girl!"</font>

153
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,560
<font color="#ffff00">And he's gone, "Oh, sorry."</font>

154
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,040
<font color="#ffff00">He said, "Oh, I'm so sorry.
I don't hit women," he said.</font>

155
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,960
<font color="#ffff00">What a guy!</font>

156
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,600
<font color="#ffff00">"I don't hit women."</font>

157
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,960
<font color="#ffff00">How about you don't hit anyone?</font>

158
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,480
<font color="#ffff00">Good rule of thumb.
And he goes, "Sorry, I got confused.</font>

159
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
<font color="#ffff00">I thought you were a fucking faggot...</font>

160
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,640
<font color="#ffff00">trying to crack on to my girlfriend."</font>

161
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,040
<font color="#ffff00">Now I understand I have a responsibility
to help lead people out of ignorance</font>

162
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,440
<font color="#ffff00">at every opportunity I can,
but I left him there, people.</font>

163
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,400
<font color="#ffff00">Safety first.</font>

164
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">The main part, the centerpiece,
of that show,</font>

165
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,560
<font color="#ffff00">was coming out to my family,
and particularly my mom.</font>

166
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,400
<font color="#ffff00">Because my mom is very funny. She lives
a comedy better than I can ever write it.</font>

167
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,200
<font color="#ffff00">Her response to me coming out,</font>

168
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,120
<font color="#ffff00">when I told her I was
a little bit lesbian...</font>

169
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
<font color="#ffff00">Baby steps.</font>

170
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,880
<font color="#ffff00">Her response... was this.
She's just gone,"Oh, Hannah.</font>

171
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,920
<font color="#ffff00">Why did you have to tell me that?</font>

172
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,160
<font color="#ffff00">That's not something I need to know.</font>

173
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,920
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, what if I told you
I was a murderer?"</font>

174
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,320
<font color="#ffff00">It's still funny.</font>

175
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,440
<font color="#ffff00">And it's a fair call. Murderer.</font>

176
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,280
<font color="#ffff00">Murderer.</font>

177
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,400
<font color="#ffff00">You would hope that's a phase.</font>

178
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,560
<font color="#ffff00">Real jokes.</font>

179
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,560
<font color="#ffff00">But I reckon I've been slacking off
in recent years</font>

180
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,200
<font color="#ffff00">with my lesbian content.</font>

181
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,000
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think I've been
representing my people</font>

182
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,800
<font color="#ffff00">as much as I should be.</font>

183
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,600
<font color="#ffff00">You know, last year, my grandma
asked me if I had a boyfriend.</font>

184
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,880
<font color="#ffff00">And I realized, in that moment,</font>

185
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,200
<font color="#ffff00">that I'd... quite forgotten...</font>

186
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,040
<font color="#ffff00">to come out to Grandma.</font>

187
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,240
<font color="#ffff00">I thought I'd...</font>

188
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,560
<font color="#ffff00">I remember it being on my to-do list.</font>

189
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
<font color="#ffff00">I thought, "I'll wait
till it comes up in conversation."</font>

190
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,280
<font color="#ffff00">But it never does.</font>

191
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,160
<font color="#ffff00">But finally it did.</font>

192
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
<font color="#ffff00">But I did not take the opportunity!</font>

193
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,400
<font color="#ffff00">No, I deflected it like a real man.</font>

194
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,120
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "No...</font>

195
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,160
<font color="#ffff00">No, Grandma.</font>

196
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,800
<font color="#ffff00">No, I don't have time for boyfriends."</font>

197
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,000
<font color="#ffff00">Plural.</font>

198
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,920
<font color="#ffff00">Confident, wasn't I?
"But if I had time, heaps!"</font>

199
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,800
<font color="#ffff00">And she said, "Ah, well, you never know.</font>

200
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,920
<font color="#ffff00">One day you might walk around the corner,
and there he'll be!"</font>

201
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,520
<font color="#ffff00">"Mr. Right," she called him.</font>

202
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,480
<font color="#ffff00">And I have been approaching every corner
with caution</font>

203
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
<font color="#ffff00">since then.</font>

204
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,240
<font color="#ffff00">No offense to Mr. Right,
if you are out there.</font>

205
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,720
<font color="#ffff00">But you're also Mr. Very Very Too Late.</font>

206
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,600
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause I've done quite a lot of work
on this lesbian situation here</font>

207
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,240
<font color="#ffff00">and I don't imagine I've got
a tight turning circle on identity.</font>

208
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,960
<font color="#ffff00">Imagine the feedback.</font>

209
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,440
<font color="#ffff00">Not enough lesbian content.</font>

210
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,240
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what I reckon my problem is?</font>

211
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,520
<font color="#ffff00">I don't lesbian enough.</font>

212
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,280
<font color="#ffff00">Not in the scheme of my existence.
Not a lot.</font>

213
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,640
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, I keep my hand in.</font>

214
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,120
<font color="#ffff00">Bit of lesbian content there.</font>

215
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,520
<font color="#ffff00">I'll be sprinkling it throughout the show.</font>

216
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,680
<font color="#ffff00">Keep your feedback forms to yourselves.</font>

217
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,040
<font color="#ffff00">No, I mean, if you were to plot my week,
I don't... Not a lot.</font>

218
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,880
<font color="#ffff00">Not a lot of lesbian-ing... gets done.</font>

219
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,080
<font color="#ffff00">I cook dinner more.
I cook dinner way more than I lesbian.</font>

220
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,040
<font color="#ffff00">But nobody every introduces me
as "that chef comedian," do they?</font>

221
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,040
<font color="#ffff00">Not enough lesbian content.</font>

222
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,880
<font color="#ffff00">I should quit. I'm a disgrace.</font>

223
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,400
<font color="#ffff00">What sort of comedian
can't even make the lesbians laugh?</font>

224
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
<font color="#ffff00">Every comedian ever.</font>

225
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,480
<font color="#ffff00">That's a good joke, isn't it? Classic.</font>

226
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,920
<font color="#ffff00">It's bulletproof, too.</font>

227
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,080
<font color="#ffff00">Very clever, because it's funny...</font>

228
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,160
<font color="#ffff00">because it's true.</font>

229
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,120
<font color="#ffff00">The only people who don't think
it's funny... are us lezzers...</font>

230
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,840
<font color="#ffff00">But we've got to laugh...
because if we don't...</font>

231
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,600
<font color="#ffff00">proves the point.</font>

232
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,560
<font color="#ffff00">Checkmate.</font>

233
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,640
<font color="#ffff00">Very clever joke.</font>

234
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,880
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't write that. That is not my joke.</font>

235
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,560
<font color="#ffff00">It's an old...  An oldie.
Oldie but a goldie. A classic.</font>

236
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,880
<font color="#ffff00">It was written, you know,
well before even  women  were funny.</font>

237
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,480
<font color="#ffff00">And back then, in the good old days,</font>

238
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,280
<font color="#ffff00">lesbian meant something different
than it does now.</font>

239
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
<font color="#ffff00">Back then, lesbian wasn't about sexuality,</font>

240
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,960
<font color="#ffff00">a lesbian was just any woman
not laughing at a man.</font>

241
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,480
<font color="#ffff00">"Why aren't you laughing? What are you?
Some kind of lesbian?" Classic.</font>

242
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,720
<font color="#ffff00">"Go on. You gotta laugh. Lighten up.
Stop taking everything so seriously!</font>

243
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,920
<font color="#ffff00">Fucking learn to take a joke.
You need to lighten up.</font>

244
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,120
<font color="#ffff00">I'll tell you what you need to lighten up.
You need a good dicking.</font>

245
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,920
<font color="#ffff00">Get a cock up you! Drink some jizz!
You know?"</font>

246
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,320
<font color="#ffff00">Actual advice?</font>

247
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,280
<font color="#ffff00">It's counterproductive.</font>

248
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
<font color="#ffff00">I do think I have to quit comedy though.</font>

249
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,600
<font color="#ffff00">And seriously.
I know it's probably not the forum...</font>

250
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,880
<font color="#ffff00">to make such an announcement, is it?</font>

251
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,400
<font color="#ffff00">In the middle of a comedy show.
But I have been questioning...</font>

252
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,360
<font color="#ffff00">you know, this whole comedy thing.</font>

253
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,840
<font color="#ffff00">I don't feel very comfortable
in it anymore.</font>

254
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,800
<font color="#ffff00">You know... over the past year,
I've been questioning it, and reassessing.</font>

255
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,080
<font color="#ffff00">And I think it's healthy
for an adult human to take stock,</font>

256
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,680
<font color="#ffff00">pause and reassess.</font>

257
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,840
<font color="#ffff00">And when I first started doing the comedy,
over a decade ago,</font>

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,040
<font color="#ffff00">my favorite comedian was Bill Cosby.</font>

259
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,760
<font color="#ffff00">There you go.
It's very healthy to reassess, isn't it?</font>

260
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,680
<font color="#ffff00">And I built a career
out of self-deprecating humor.</font>

261
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I've built my career on.</font>

262

Pink headbands on bald babies!</font>

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,880
<font color="#ffff00">That's weird.</font>

I understand that.</font>

bald babies are boys.</font>

307
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,560
<font color="#ffff00">I assume they're angry feminists,

308
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
<font color="#ffff00">How about this?</font>

309
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,840
<font color="#ffff00">How about we stop separating the children
into opposing teams from day dot?</font>

310
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,880
<font color="#ffff00">How about we give them, I dunno, seven
to ten years to consider themselves...</font>

311
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,760
<font color="#ffff00">on the same side?</font>

312
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,320
<font color="#ffff00">Did you know human men and human women
have more in common...</font>

313
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,240
<font color="#ffff00">than they don't? Did you know that?</font>

314
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,760
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think many people do know that
because we always focus on the difference.</font>

315
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,240
<font color="#ffff00">The difference between men and women.</font>

00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,440
<font color="#ffff00">They're very different.
Now, dogs are heaps different to...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">"Men and women are very different.
We're from different planets!"</font>

and women are for his penis.</font>

319
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,240
<font color="#ffff00">Here's an idea. I say we get rid of pink
and give all the babies blue.</font>

320
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,920
<font color="#ffff00">I've thought about this and it's not
because blue is a masculine color.</font>

321
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,640
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause that... is false.</font>

322
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,560
<font color="#ffff00">I love that people go,
"Blue, yeah, a very masculine color.</font>

323
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,280
<font color="#ffff00">Very reliable.</font>

324
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,360
<font color="#ffff00">Very rational color, blue.</font>

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,480
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, you can trust blue.</font>

326
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
<font color="#ffff00">It's why we've got it on flags.</font>

327
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,400
<font color="#ffff00">Lot of blue on flags. Navy blue.
Everyone trusts a boat."</font>

328
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,320
<font color="#ffff00">Blue, if anything, is a feminine color.</font>

329
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,400
<font color="#ffff00">It really is full of contradictions.</font>

330
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,440
<font color="#ffff00">You know, blue is a cold color.
It's on the cold end of the spectrum.</font>

331
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,280
<font color="#ffff00">But the hottest part of the flame?</font>

332
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,760
<font color="#ffff00">Blue.</font>

333
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,120
<font color="#ffff00">If you're feeling blue...</font>

334
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,840
<font color="#ffff00">you're sad.</font>

335
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,600
<font color="#ffff00">But optimism? Blue skies ahead!</font>

336
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,320
<font color="#ffff00">Make up your mind.</font>

337
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,240
<font color="#ffff00">A blueprint is a plan,</font>

338
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,720
<font color="#ffff00">but if something happens not on the plan,
where does that come from?</font>

339
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,040
<font color="#ffff00">Out of the blue!</font>

340
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,720
<font color="#ffff00">Blue's a wonderful color
to start life with.</font>

341
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,440
<font color="#ffff00">There's room for every kind of human
in blue.</font>

342
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,240
<font color="#ffff00">There's a whole spectrum,
'cause blue doesn't demand...</font>

343
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,120
<font color="#ffff00">it doesn't demand action
like all the other colors.</font>

344
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,400
<font color="#ffff00">Think about this.</font>

345
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
<font color="#ffff00">You're stuck in traffic...</font>

346
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,680
<font color="#ffff00">and the lights turn...</font>

347
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,280
<font color="#ffff00">blue.</font>

348
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,520
<font color="#ffff00">Less road rage, people. Less road rage.</font>

349
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,800
<font color="#ffff00">More accidents, ironically enough.</font>

350
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,640
<font color="#ffff00">I get mistaken for a man quite a lot.</font>

351
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,440
<font color="#ffff00">But not for long.</font>

352
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,600
<font color="#ffff00">My masculinity doesn't hold up
to scrutiny. I'm only a man at a glance.</font>

353
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,240
<font color="#ffff00">Which means it happens
in a customer service situation, usually.</font>

354
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,840
<font color="#ffff00">Because I'm only a man at a glance,
it means I'm very much right there still.</font>

355
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,480
<font color="#ffff00">Right in front of the person
who's just called me "sir"...</font>

356
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,760
<font color="#ffff00">and deeply regrets it.</font>

357
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,240
<font color="#ffff00">The really good ones just erase my memory
of being called "sir."</font>

358
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
<font color="#ffff00">They're clever. It's a clever trick.
They do that with a combination...</font>

359
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,960
<font color="#ffff00">of hypnosis, and the magic word.</font>

360
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,680
<font color="#ffff00">They go, "Can I help you, sir?</font>

361
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,160
<font color="#ffff00">Madam."</font>

362
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,000
<font color="#ffff00">And it works.</font>

363
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,440
<font color="#ffff00">Gone.</font>

364
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,760
<font color="#ffff00">I do not remember being called "sir"
if someone calls me "madam"</font>

365
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,080
<font color="#ffff00">immediately after.</font>

366
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,240
<font color="#ffff00">Because "madam" is a very triggering word
for me.</font>

367
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,320
<font color="#ffff00">It is. It's what my mom used to call me
when I was in a lot of trouble...</font>

368
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,720
<font color="#ffff00">for opening a brothel.</font>

369
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,120
<font color="#ffff00">Can we just have more words?</font>

370
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,360
<font color="#ffff00">It's the apology I don't understand,</font>

371
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,200
<font color="#ffff00">when people apologize
for mistaking me for a man.</font>

372
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,880
<font color="#ffff00">I got it on a flight recently.
Walking on, the cabin manager,</font>

373
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,680
<font color="#ffff00">"Welcome aboard, sir.</font>

374
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,320
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, madam, I'm so sorry.</font>

375
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
<font color="#ffff00">I'm so sorry. I'm sorry."</font>

376
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,320
<font color="#ffff00">I was like, "It's okay!</font>

377
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,840
<font color="#ffff00">It's not like you called a man 'madam'.
That could have been..."</font>

378
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,360
<font color="#ffff00">So I said, "Don't worry."
She said, "I'm so sorry."</font>

379
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:48,360
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Don't apologize.
In fact, I should thank you. I enjoyed it.</font>

380
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,360
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you. Never apologize.
Don't apologize.</font>

381
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,240
<font color="#ffff00">Look, I don't identify as transgender,</font>

382
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,120
<font color="#ffff00">but I'm partial to a holiday.</font>

383
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,600
<font color="#ffff00">I love being mistaken for a man,
'cause just for a few moments,</font>

384
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,520
<font color="#ffff00">life gets a hell of a lot easier.</font>

385
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,680
<font color="#ffff00">I'm top-shelf normal, king of the humans.
I'm a straight white man.</font>

386
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,000
<font color="#ffff00">I'm about...</font>

for no fucking effort!</font>

388
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,400
<font color="#ffff00">Do not apologize. I was going to take
my assigned seat and both the armrests.</font>

391
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,520
<font color="#ffff00">Just jokes. I wouldn't want to be
a straight white man. Not... right now.</font>

00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,560
<font color="#ffff00">This is...</font>

393
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,600
<font color="#ffff00">Not at this moment in history. It is not
a good time to be a straight white man.</font>

394
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,960
<font color="#ffff00">I wouldn't want to be
a straight white man. Not if you paid me.</font>

395
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,680
<font color="#ffff00">Although the pay would be
substantially better.</font>

396
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
<font color="#ffff00">But, no...</font>

397
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,200
<font color="#ffff00">I don't think it's an easy time
for you fellas, I do feel for you.</font>

398
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,760
<font color="#ffff00">Very difficult, very confusing time.</font>

399
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,640
<font color="#ffff00">Because-- And you're not coping.</font>

400
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,760
<font color="#ffff00">Because, for the first time ever, you're
suddenly a sub-category of human.</font>

401
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,640
<font color="#ffff00">Right? "No, we invented the categories.
We're not supposed to play!</font>

402
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,200
<font color="#ffff00">We're human-neutral."</font>

403
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
<font color="#ffff00">Not anymore.</font>

404
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,120
<font color="#ffff00">I've always been judged by what I am.</font>

405
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,320
<font color="#ffff00">Always been a fat, ugly dyke.
I'm dead inside. I can cope.</font>

406
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,440
<font color="#ffff00">But you fellas... Bit soft in the belly?</font>

407
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,960
<font color="#ffff00">You hear "straight white man,"
you're like, "No.</font>

408
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,520
<font color="#ffff00">No, that's reverse sexism."</font>

409
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,880
<font color="#ffff00">No, it's not.
You wrote the rules. Read them.</font>

410
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,200
<font color="#ffff00">Just jokes. Banter.
Don't feel intimidated.</font>

411
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,800
<font color="#ffff00">It's just locker room talk.</font>

412
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,720
<font color="#ffff00">[audience cheers]</font>

413
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,920
<font color="#ffff00">Just jokes, though.</font>

414
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,840
<font color="#ffff00">Just jokes.</font>

415
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,720
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know why I love picking on,
telling jokes about straight white men?</font>

416
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,400
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause they're such good sports.</font>

417
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,240
<font color="#ffff00">They're like, "Oh, good joke about me.</font>

418
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,160
<font color="#ffff00">That's a refreshing perspective.</font>

419
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,320
<font color="#ffff00">If you hate men so much, why do you
try so fucking hard to look like one?"</font>

420
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,440
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause you need a good role model
right now, fellas.</font>

421
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,320
<font color="#ffff00">[audience cheers]</font>

422
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,680
<font color="#ffff00">Dropping like flies.</font>

423
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,760
<font color="#ffff00">Jokes aside, if I may just give you
a little human-to-human advice.</font>

424
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,640
<font color="#ffff00">Because I do understand it is a difficult
and confusing time for you now.</font>

425
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,160
<font color="#ffff00">You know, it's changing, it's shifting,
and I understand that.</font>

426
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,680
<font color="#ffff00">But... may I just, you know,
suggest that you learn</font>

427
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,560
<font color="#ffff00">to, sort of, move
beyond your defensiveness.</font>

428
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,440
<font color="#ffff00">Right? That's your first point,
you're stuck on it,</font>

429
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,680
<font color="#ffff00">but you need to get some space around it,
learn to develop...</font>

430
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:14,560
<font color="#ffff00">try and develop a sense of humor about it,
or you need to lighten up, learn to laugh.</font>

431
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,080
<font color="#ffff00">Tell you what might help.
How about a good dicking?</font>

432
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,320
<font color="#ffff00">Get a cock up ya, drink some jizz!</font>

433
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,880
<font color="#ffff00">You gotta laugh!</font>

434
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,000
<font color="#ffff00">That's weird advice, isn't it?</font>

435
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,040
<font color="#ffff00">It's weird.</font>

436
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,520
<font color="#ffff00">It doesn't... It's not good, is it?
It doesn't feel very nice, does it?</font>

437
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
<font color="#ffff00">Laughter's the best medicine, they say.</font>

438
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,040
<font color="#ffff00">I don't. I reckon penicillin
might give it the nudge.</font>

439
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,760
<font color="#ffff00">There is truth to it, though.
Laughter is very good for the human.</font>

440
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,040
<font color="#ffff00">It really is.</font>

441
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,680
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause when you laugh,
you release tension.</font>

442
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,920
<font color="#ffff00">And when you hold tension
in your human body, it's not healthy.</font>

443
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,360
<font color="#ffff00">It's not healthy psychologically
or physically.</font>

444
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,400
<font color="#ffff00">That's why it's good to laugh. It's even
better to laugh with other people.</font>

445
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,880
<font color="#ffff00">When you laugh, in a room full of people,
when you share a laugh,</font>

446
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,000
<font color="#ffff00">you will release more tension</font>

447
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,240
<font color="#ffff00">because laughter is infectious.</font>

448
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,080
<font color="#ffff00">You stand to release more tension
when you laugh with other people</font>

449
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,920
<font color="#ffff00">than you would if you laugh alone.</font>

450
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,120
<font color="#ffff00">Mainly because when you laugh alone,
that's mental illness</font>

451
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,920
<font color="#ffff00">and that's a different kind of tension.</font>

452
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
<font color="#ffff00">Laughter doesn't help.</font>

453
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
<font color="#ffff00">Trust me.</font>

454
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,120
<font color="#ffff00">Tension isolates us.</font>

455
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,240
<font color="#ffff00">And laughter connects us.</font>

456
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,480
<font color="#ffff00">Good result. Good on me.</font>

457
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,600
<font color="#ffff00">What a guy.</font>

458
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,600
<font color="#ffff00">What a guy. I'm basically Mother Teresa.</font>

459
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,280
<font color="#ffff00">But just like Mother Teresa...</font>

460
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,280
<font color="#ffff00">my methods are not exactly charitable.</font>

461
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,080
<font color="#ffff00">Let me explain to you what a joke is.</font>

462
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,200
<font color="#ffff00">And when you strip it back
to its bare essential... components,</font>

463
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,600
<font color="#ffff00">like, its bare minimum,</font>

464
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,840
<font color="#ffff00">a joke is simply two things,
it needs two things to work.</font>

465
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,400
<font color="#ffff00">A setup and a punch line.</font>

466
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,240
<font color="#ffff00">And it is essentially a question
with a surprise answer.</font>

467
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,880
<font color="#ffff00">Right? But in this context,</font>

468
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,760
<font color="#ffff00">what a joke is is a question</font>

469
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,520
<font color="#ffff00">that I have artificially inseminated.</font>

470
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,000
<font color="#ffff00">Tension. I do that, that's my job.</font>

471
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,480
<font color="#ffff00">I make you all feel tense,</font>

472
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,560
<font color="#ffff00">and then I make you laugh,
and you're like, "Thanks for that.</font>

473
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,080
<font color="#ffff00">I was feeling a bit tense."</font>

474
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,760
<font color="#ffff00">I made you tense.</font>

475
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,400
<font color="#ffff00">This is an abusive relationship.</font>

476
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,760
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know why I'm such a funny fucker?</font>

477
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:47,080
<font color="#ffff00">Do you? It's because, you know, I've been
learning the art of tension diffusion</font>

478
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,760
<font color="#ffff00">since I was a children.</font>

479
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,280
<font color="#ffff00">Back then it wasn't a job,
wasn't even a hobby,</font>

480
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,000
<font color="#ffff00">it was a survival tactic.</font>

481
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,320
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't have to invent the tension.</font>

482
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,120
<font color="#ffff00">I was the tension.</font>

483
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,560
<font color="#ffff00">And... I'm tired of tension.</font>

484
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,160
<font color="#ffff00">Tension is making me sick.</font>

485
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,240
<font color="#ffff00">It is time... I stopped... comedy.</font>

486
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,200
<font color="#ffff00">I have to quit comedy... but I mean...</font>

487
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,640
<font color="#ffff00">I can't quit you.</font>

488
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,640
<font color="#ffff00">No, I can't quit you. I can't.</font>

489
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,240
<font color="#ffff00">Because I don't have a backup plan, guys.</font>

490
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
<font color="#ffff00">What have I got?</font>

491
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:29,720
<font color="#ffff00">Fifteen years ago, I barely graduated
from an Art History degree.</font>

492
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,720
<font color="#ffff00">Fifteen years ago.</font>

493
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
<font color="#ffff00">Art History. Fifteen--</font>

494
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,200
<font color="#ffff00">They were dead then. They're just deader.</font>

495
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,480
<font color="#ffff00">My CV is pretty much a cock and balls
drawn under a fax number.</font>

496
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:51,200
<font color="#ffff00">Could you imagine me working in a gallery
with an asymmetrical woolen poncho</font>

497
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
<font color="#ffff00">with an aggressive... fringe?</font>

498
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,360
<font color="#ffff00">Nasty jewelry, having the opinion?</font>

499
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,720
<font color="#ffff00">No. There's...
You know, art history is highbrow.</font>

500
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,280
<font color="#ffff00">I don't belong in that world,
I'm not from that world.</font>

501
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,600
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not from money, or even
that much chat, if I'm honest, but...</font>

502
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,040
<font color="#ffff00">high art, you know,
that's what elevates and civilizes people.</font>

503
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,960
<font color="#ffff00">You know, galleries, the ballet,
the the-a-ter.</font>

504
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,720
<font color="#ffff00">All these things,
you go there, you get better.</font>

505
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,240
<font color="#ffff00">Comedy? Lowbrow.</font>

506
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:27,960
<font color="#ffff00">Well, I'm sorry to inform you, but nobody
here is leaving this room a better person.</font>

507
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:32,560
<font color="#ffff00">We're just rolling around
in our own shit here, people.</font>

508
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,960
<font color="#ffff00">But I-- A couple of years ago,
a man came up to me after... my show.</font>

509
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,200
<font color="#ffff00">He had an opinion.</font>

510
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,560
<font color="#ffff00">Lesbians give feedback.</font>

511
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,920
<font color="#ffff00">Men? Opinions.</font>

512
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,920
<font color="#ffff00">Now, in the show, I'd spoken about
taking antidepressant medication,</font>

513
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,440
<font color="#ffff00">and he had an opinion on that.</font>

514
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,280
<font color="#ffff00">Now, interestingly, I'd also spoken about
how unhelpful unsolicited advice is</font>

515
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,480
<font color="#ffff00">in a... mental health plan,
but he mustn't have heard that bit.</font>

516
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,640
<font color="#ffff00">He came up to me after the show
to give me his opinion.</font>

517
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,520
<font color="#ffff00">He said, "You shouldn't take medication
because you're an artist.</font>

518
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,480
<font color="#ffff00">It's important that you feel."</font>

519
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,880
<font color="#ffff00">He said, "If Vincent van Gogh
had have taken medication,</font>

520
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,280
<font color="#ffff00">we wouldn't have the sunflowers."</font>

521
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,680
<font color="#ffff00">I never, ever, ever thought that my art
history degree would ever come in handy.</font>

522
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,840
<font color="#ffff00">But, oh, my lord.</font>

523
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,880
<font color="#ffff00">I tore that man
a college debt-sized new arsehole.</font>

524
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,240
<font color="#ffff00">I said, "Good opinion, mate.</font>

525
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
<font color="#ffff00">Except that he did medicate.</font>

526
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,160
<font color="#ffff00">A lot.</font>

527
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,280
<font color="#ffff00">He self-medicated a lot. He drank a lot.
He even nibbled on his own paints.</font>

528
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,200
<font color="#ffff00">Problem.</font>

529
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,120
<font color="#ffff00">And also, you know what else?</font>

530
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,800
<font color="#ffff00">He didn't just paint sunflowers, he did
quite a few portraits of psychiatrists.</font>

531
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,400
<font color="#ffff00">Not even random ones.
Psychiatrists who were treating him.</font>

532
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,440
<font color="#ffff00">And medicating him.</font>

533
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,680
<font color="#ffff00">And there's one particular portrait
of one particular psychiatrist,</font>

534
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,720
<font color="#ffff00">and he's holding a flower,
and it isn't a sunflower.</font>

535
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,080
<font color="#ffff00">It's a foxglove.</font>

536
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,640
<font color="#ffff00">And that foxglove forms part
of a medication</font>

537
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,160
<font color="#ffff00">that Van Gogh... took for epilepsy.</font>

538
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,760
<font color="#ffff00">And that derivative of the foxglove plant
medi-fucking-cation..."</font>

539
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,720
<font color="#ffff00">I must have skipped a dose that day
'cause I was feeling.</font>

540
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,040
<font color="#ffff00">"The derivative of the foxglove, if you
overdose it a bit, you know what happens?</font>

541
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:56,600
<font color="#ffff00">You can experience the color yellow
a little too intensely.</font>

542
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,960
<font color="#ffff00">So perhaps... we have the sunflowers
precisely because...</font>

543
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,560
<font color="#ffff00">Van Gogh medicated.</font>

544
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,560
<font color="#ffff00">What do you honestly think, mate?" I said.</font>

545
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,360
<font color="#ffff00">"That creativity means you must suffer?</font>

546
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,800
<font color="#ffff00">That is the burden of creativity?</font>

547
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,200
<font color="#ffff00">Just so you can enjoy it?</font>

548
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,280
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck you, mate.
If you like sunflowers so much,</font>

549
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,040
<font color="#ffff00">buy a bunch and jerk off into a geranium."</font>

550
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,880
<font color="#ffff00">Know what he said?</font>

551
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
<font color="#ffff00">He goes,</font>

552
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,960
<font color="#ffff00">"No need to be so sensitive."</font>

553
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,440
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not being sensitive. I'm an artist.</font>

554
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
<font color="#ffff00">That's feeling.</font>

555
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:56,080
<font color="#ffff00">"Don't be so sensitive." That is the
most common nugget of advice I get.</font>

556
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause I'm a very sensitive person.</font>

557
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,440
<font color="#ffff00">And I get told to
"stop being so sensitive" an awful lot.</font>

558
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,880
<font color="#ffff00">And it is always yelled.</font>

559
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,720
<font color="#ffff00">Which I find very insensitive.</font>

560
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
<font color="#ffff00">I don't get it.</font>

561
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,080
<font color="#ffff00">"Stop being so sensitive."
I don't understand.</font>

562
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,800
<font color="#ffff00">Why is insensitivity
something to strive for?</font>

563
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,760
<font color="#ffff00">I happen to know that my sensitivity
is my strength. I know that.</font>

564
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,480
<font color="#ffff00">It's my sensitivity that's helped me
navigate a very difficult path in life.</font>

565
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,560
<font color="#ffff00">So when somebody tells me
to "stop being so sensitive,"</font>

566
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,480
<font color="#ffff00">you know what?
I feel a little bit like a nose</font>

567
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,880
<font color="#ffff00">being lectured by a fart.</font>

568
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,280
<font color="#ffff00">Not the problem.</font>

569
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,600
<font color="#ffff00">I feel like, in a comedy show, there's
no room for the best part of the story...</font>

570
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
<font color="#ffff00">which is the ending.</font>

571
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,760
<font color="#ffff00">You know, in order to finish on a laugh,</font>

572
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,560
<font color="#ffff00">you know, you have to end...
with punch lines.</font>

573
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,480
<font color="#ffff00">Like, take my coming-out story,
for example. The best part of that story</font>

574
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,080
<font color="#ffff00">is the fact that Mum and I have
a wonderful relationship now.</font>

575
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,440
<font color="#ffff00">More than mother and daughter,
we're friends, we trust each other.</font>

576
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,640
<font color="#ffff00">Look what I did to the room. No tension.
You're just going, "Good on you.</font>

577
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,800
<font color="#ffff00">Got a good relationship with your mum,
have you?</font>

578
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,680
<font color="#ffff00">Can you go back to the tension?</font>

579
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,160
<font color="#ffff00">That was hilarious."</font>

580
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,800
<font color="#ffff00">But, yeah, Mum said to me last year,
she said,</font>

581
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,640
<font color="#ffff00">"I'm very proud... that I raised you kids
without religion."</font>

582
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,640
<font color="#ffff00">I'd love to give you guys context on that,</font>

583
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,360
<font color="#ffff00">but that's not how
my mum runs a conversation.</font>

584
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,120
<font color="#ffff00">I have no idea why she brought that up
in Target.</font>

585
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,880
<font color="#ffff00">No idea.</font>

586
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,160
<font color="#ffff00">She said, "I'm very proud
that I raised you kids without religion</font>

587
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,120
<font color="#ffff00">because, you know, I've raised
five children with minds of their own."</font>

588
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,640
<font color="#ffff00">And I've just sort of gone, "Good on you.</font>

589
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,160
<font color="#ffff00">What aren't you proud of, Mum?"</font>

590
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,480
<font color="#ffff00">I was home for a week. We had time.</font>

591
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,880
<font color="#ffff00">Because Mum and I have established jokes
around this difficult time in our life.</font>

592
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,000
<font color="#ffff00">We really do. The banter, if you will.</font>

593
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,080
<font color="#ffff00">I say things like,
"Mum, you made my life very difficult."</font>

594
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,800
<font color="#ffff00">And she'll go, "Yeah, well, I don't think
I liked you very much."</font>

595
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,600
<font color="#ffff00">And we laugh!</font>

596
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,960
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause you've got to laugh. And...</font>

597
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,880
<font color="#ffff00">But not this day.
She went quiet and... got tense.</font>

598
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
<font color="#ffff00">But what my mum eventually said to me</font>

599
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,440
<font color="#ffff00">is pretty much... at the core</font>

600
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,720
<font color="#ffff00">of why I'm questioning... comedy.</font>

601
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,440
<font color="#ffff00">She said to me, "The thing I regret</font>

602
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,400
<font color="#ffff00">is that I raised you
as if you were straight.</font>

603
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,200
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't know any different.
I am so sorry.</font>

604
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,160
<font color="#ffff00">I'm so sorry.</font>

605
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,080
<font color="#ffff00">I knew... well before you did...</font>

606
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,080
<font color="#ffff00">that your life was going to be so hard.
I knew that,</font>

607
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,000
<font color="#ffff00">and I wanted it more than anything
in the world not to be the case.</font>

608
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,880
<font color="#ffff00">And I know I made it worse,</font>

609
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,680
<font color="#ffff00">because I wanted  you  to change
because I knew the world wouldn't."</font>

610
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,920
<font color="#ffff00">And I looked at my mum in that moment</font>

611
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,160
<font color="#ffff00">and thought, "How did that happen?</font>

612
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,120
<font color="#ffff00">How did my mum</font>

613
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,400
<font color="#ffff00">get to be the hero of  my  story?"</font>

614
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,160
<font color="#ffff00">She evolved.</font>

615
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,960
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't.</font>

616
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,760
<font color="#ffff00">See... I think part of my problem</font>

617
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,360
<font color="#ffff00">is comedy has suspended me
in a perpetual state of adolescence.</font>

618
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,880
<font color="#ffff00">The way I've been telling that story</font>

619
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,800
<font color="#ffff00">is through jokes.</font>

620
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:03,120
<font color="#ffff00">And stories... unlike jokes,
need three parts.</font>

621
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,400
<font color="#ffff00">A beginning, a middle, and an end.</font>

622
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,680
<font color="#ffff00">Jokes... only need two parts.</font>

623
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,400
<font color="#ffff00">A beginning and a middle.</font>

624
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,720
<font color="#ffff00">And what I had done,
with that comedy show about coming out,</font>

625
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,480
<font color="#ffff00">was I froze an incredibly formative
experience at its trauma point</font>

626
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,560
<font color="#ffff00">and I sealed it off into jokes.</font>

627
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,800
<font color="#ffff00">And that story became a routine,
and through repetition,</font>

628
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,040
<font color="#ffff00">that joke version fused with
my actual memory of what happened.</font>

629
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,520
<font color="#ffff00">But unfortunately that joke version
was not nearly sophisticated enough</font>

630
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,240
<font color="#ffff00">to help me undo the damage done to me
in reality.</font>

631
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
<font color="#ffff00">Punch lines need trauma</font>

632
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,960
<font color="#ffff00">because punch lines...</font>

633
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,720
<font color="#ffff00">need tension, and tension feeds trauma.</font>

634
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,360
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't come out to my grandma last year
because I'm still ashamed of who I am.</font>

635
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,240
<font color="#ffff00">Not intellectually.</font>

636
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
<font color="#ffff00">But, right there,</font>

637
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,040
<font color="#ffff00">I still have shame.</font>

638
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,160
<font color="#ffff00">You learn from the part of the story
you focus on.</font>

639
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,440
<font color="#ffff00">I need to tell my story properly.</font>

640
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,680
<font color="#ffff00">Because the closet, for me,
was no easy thing... to come out of.</font>

641
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,480
<font color="#ffff00">From the years 1989 to 1997, right?</font>

642
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,200
<font color="#ffff00">This is ten years.
Effectively my adolescence.</font>

643
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,960
<font color="#ffff00">Tasmania was at the center
of a very toxic national debate</font>

644
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,640
<font color="#ffff00">about homosexuality and whether or not
it should be legalized.</font>

645
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,240
<font color="#ffff00">And I'm from the northwest coast
of Tasmania, the Bible Belt.</font>

646
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,520
<font color="#ffff00">Seventy percent of the people...
I lived amongst...</font>

647
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,680
<font color="#ffff00">believe that homosexuality should be...
a criminal act.</font>

648
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,800
<font color="#ffff00">Seventy percent of the people who
raised me, who loved me, who I trusted,</font>

649
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,760
<font color="#ffff00">believed that homosexuality was a sin,</font>

650
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,520
<font color="#ffff00">that homosexuals were heinous,
sub-human pedophiles.</font>

651
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,040
<font color="#ffff00">Seventy percent.</font>

652
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,600
<font color="#ffff00">By the time I identified as being gay,
it was too late.</font>

653
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,600
<font color="#ffff00">I was already homophobic, and you do not
get to just flick a switch on that.</font>

654
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,040
<font color="#ffff00">No, what you do is you internalize
that homophobia</font>

655
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,880
<font color="#ffff00">and you learn to hate yourself.</font>

656
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,560
<font color="#ffff00">Hate yourself to the core.</font>

657
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,840
<font color="#ffff00">I sat soaking in shame...</font>

658
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,200
<font color="#ffff00">in the closet, for ten years.</font>

659
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,720
<font color="#ffff00">Because the closet can only stop you
from being seen. It is not shame-proof.</font>

660
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
<font color="#ffff00">When you soak a child in shame,</font>

661
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,640
<font color="#ffff00">they cannot develop the neurological
pathways that carry thought...</font>

662
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,640
<font color="#ffff00">you know, carry thoughts of self-worth.</font>

663
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,560
<font color="#ffff00">They can't do that.</font>

664
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:49,400
<font color="#ffff00">Self-hatred is only ever a seed
planted from outside in.</font>

665
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,280
<font color="#ffff00">But when you do that to a child,</font>

666
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,400
<font color="#ffff00">it becomes a weed so thick,
and it grows so fast,</font>

667
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480
<font color="#ffff00">the child doesn't know any different.</font>

668
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,000
<font color="#ffff00">It becomes... as natural as gravity.</font>

669
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,520
<font color="#ffff00">When I came out of the closet,
I didn't have any jokes.</font>

670
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,520
<font color="#ffff00">The only thing I knew how to do
was to be invisible and hate myself.</font>

671
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,600
<font color="#ffff00">It took me ten years to understand I was
allowed to take up space in the world.</font>

672
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,120
<font color="#ffff00">But, by then, I'd sealed it off into jokes
like it was no big deal.</font>

673
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,800
<font color="#ffff00">I need to tell my story properly.</font>

674
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:27,280
<font color="#ffff00">Because I paid dearly for a lesson that
nobody seems to have wanted to learn.</font>

675
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,440
<font color="#ffff00">And this is bigger... than homosexuality.</font>

676
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,920
<font color="#ffff00">This is about how we conduct debate</font>

677
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,240
<font color="#ffff00">in public about sensitive things.</font>

678
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,160
<font color="#ffff00">It's toxic, it's juvenile,
it's destructive.</font>

679
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,840
<font color="#ffff00">We think it's more important to be right</font>

680
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,040
<font color="#ffff00">than it is to appeal to the humanity
of people we disagree with.</font>

681
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,560
<font color="#ffff00">Ignorance will always walk amongst us</font>

682
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:52,240
<font color="#ffff00">because we will never know
all of the things.</font>

683
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,400
<font color="#ffff00">I need to tell my story properly</font>

684
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,080
<font color="#ffff00">because you learn from
the part of the story... you focus on.</font>

685
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,520
<font color="#ffff00">Take Vincent.</font>

686
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,400
<font color="#ffff00">Old mate... Vincent van Gogh.</font>

687
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,080
<font color="#ffff00">The way we tell his story... it's no good.</font>

688
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,920
<font color="#ffff00">It's destructive. Because we've reduced it
to a tale of rags to riches.</font>

689
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
<font color="#ffff00">He only sold one painting in his life.</font>

690
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,160
<font color="#ffff00">You know? Now look at him.</font>

691
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,240
<font color="#ffff00">"He's quite dead."
Yeah, but very successful!</font>

692
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,240
<font color="#ffff00">Only sold one painting in his lifetime.</font>

693
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,480
<font color="#ffff00">And people believe, with that story, that
Van Gogh was this misunderstood genius.</font>

694
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,360
<font color="#ffff00">You know, he was born ahead of his time.</font>

695
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,960
<font color="#ffff00">What a load of shit.</font>

696
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,920
<font color="#ffff00">Nobody is born ahead of their time.</font>

697
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,920
<font color="#ffff00">It's impossible!</font>

698
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,600
<font color="#ffff00">Nobody's born ahead of their time!</font>

699
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,320
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe premmie babies, but they catch up!</font>

700
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,200
<font color="#ffff00">Artists don't invent zeitgeists!</font>

701
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,000
<font color="#ffff00">They respond to it.</font>

702
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,880
<font color="#ffff00">He was not ahead of his time.
He was a Post-Impressionist painter,</font>

703
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,400
<font color="#ffff00">painting at the peak
of Post-Impressionism,</font>

704
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,400
<font color="#ffff00">while Peter was picking
his pickled pepper.</font>

705
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,160
<font color="#ffff00">He wasn't born ahead of his time.</font>

706
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,800
<font color="#ffff00">He couldn't network.</font>

707
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,480
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause he was mental.</font>

708
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,160
<font color="#ffff00">He was... crazy. He had unstable energy.</font>

709
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,520
<font color="#ffff00">People would cross the street
to avoid him.</font>

710
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,440
<font color="#ffff00">That's why he didn't sell any more
than one painting in his lifetime.</font>

711
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,960
<font color="#ffff00">He couldn't network.</font>

712
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,800
<font color="#ffff00">This whole idea, this romanticizing
of mental illness, is ridiculous.</font>

713
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:26,840
<font color="#ffff00">It is not a ticket to genius.</font>

714
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,040
<font color="#ffff00">It's a ticket to fucking nowhere.</font>

715
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,480
<font color="#ffff00">And artists are not these incredible,
you know, mythical creatures</font>

716
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,120
<font color="#ffff00">that exist outside of the world.</font>

717
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,960
<font color="#ffff00">No, artists have always been
very much part of the world,</font>

718
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,200
<font color="#ffff00">and very... very firmly attached to power.</font>

719
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,280
<font color="#ffff00">Always.
Power and money, art is always there.</font>

720
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,160
<font color="#ffff00">Right back to the Renaissance.
Oh, the Turtles? All of them.</font>

721
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,840
<font color="#ffff00">All of them, they knew how to network.</font>

722
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:55,960
<font color="#ffff00">Leonardo?</font>

723
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,640
<font color="#ffff00">Raphael?</font>

724
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,600
<font color="#ffff00">Donatello?</font>

725
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,240
<font color="#ffff00">They're right up there, painting
their own business cards, schmoozing.</font>

726
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,480
<font color="#ffff00">Michelangelo was a bit difficult,
he was a bit... crazy.</font>

727
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,800
<font color="#ffff00">But, you know, he still networked.
He gave gobbies to the Pope.</font>

728
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:16,080
<font color="#ffff00">Kissed his ring. Literally. But...</font>

729
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,840
<font color="#ffff00">I think it's a shame that art history
is such an elitist sport.</font>

730
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,760
<font color="#ffff00">It taught me a lot, you know.</font>

731
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,640
<font color="#ffff00">Useless...
as far as a money-earner's concerned,</font>

732
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,280
<font color="#ffff00">but I learned a lot about the world
because of art history.</font>

733
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,880
<font color="#ffff00">I understand this world very well.</font>

734
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,800
<font color="#ffff00">I understand the world I live in...
because of art history.</font>

735
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,280
<font color="#ffff00">I understand the world I live in
and my place in it.</font>

736
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,200
<font color="#ffff00">And I don't have one.</font>

737
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,320
<font color="#ffff00">And do you know how much time
that saved me?</font>

738
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,960
<font color="#ffff00">I'm quite old, but look at the skin!</font>

739
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,680
<font color="#ffff00">That's 'cause I haven't wasted time
looking... for how I fit in.</font>

740
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,760
<font color="#ffff00">I don't.</font>

741
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,200
<font color="#ffff00">A lot of naps.</font>

742
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,360
<font color="#ffff00">Art history taught me there's only
ever been two types of women.</font>

743
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,120
<font color="#ffff00">A virgin or a whore.</font>

744
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,040
<font color="#ffff00">Most people think that Miley Cyrus
and Taylor Swift invented that binary,</font>

745
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,360
<font color="#ffff00">but it's been going on thousands of years.</font>

746
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,760
<font color="#ffff00">There's only ever been two options
for a little girl to grow up into.</font>

747
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,000
<font color="#ffff00">Virgin or whore.
We were always given a choice.</font>

748
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,360
<font color="#ffff00">Take your pick.
Ladies' choice! That's the trick.</font>

749
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,680
<font color="#ffff00">The patriarchy, it's not a dictatorship.
Take your choice!</font>

750
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:28,280
<font color="#ffff00">And I don't fit very neatly
into either of those categories.</font>

751
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,840
<font color="#ffff00">Virgin or whore?</font>

752
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,880
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, on a technicality, I'd get virgin.</font>

753
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,760
<font color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

754
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,680
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know, if you go into a gallery
with ye olde paintings there,</font>

755
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,840
<font color="#ffff00">there's a lot of evidence to suggest that
women have existed for a very long time.</font>

756
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,880
<font color="#ffff00">Longer than clothes.</font>

757
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,920
<font color="#ffff00">But not this masculine, off-center,
lesbian situation here.</font>

758
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,120
<font color="#ffff00">And I... Art history taught me, you know,</font>

759
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,920
<font color="#ffff00">I look at these history women and I don't
feel like I'm the same species.</font>

760
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,040
<font color="#ffff00">There's a lot of things that I do,
and it's not an identity construction.</font>

761
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,080
<font color="#ffff00">No, I've...
Just things happen naturally.</font>

762
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,880
<font color="#ffff00">And art history taught me that these
things are not really the place</font>

763
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,960
<font color="#ffff00">of a woman, you know?</font>

764
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,080
<font color="#ffff00">One of the things I do, I can generate
thoughts in my own brain... unprompted.</font>

765
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,160
<font color="#ffff00">I can do that, all the time!</font>

766
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,960
<font color="#ffff00">Had another one.
They just come all the time, and...</font>

767
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,120
<font color="#ffff00">Art history taught me, you know,</font>

768
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,760
<font color="#ffff00">historically, women didn't have time
for the think-thoughts.</font>

769
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,760
<font color="#ffff00">They were too busy napping,
naked, alone, in the forest.</font>

770
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,160
<font color="#ffff00">Even biologically...
I don't feel like I'm the same species.</font>

771
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,880
<font color="#ffff00">For a start,
I've got a functioning skeletal system.</font>

772
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,200
<font color="#ffff00">If you go into the galleries,</font>

773
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,800
<font color="#ffff00">you see, if a woman's not sporting
a corset and/or a hymen...</font>

774
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,640
<font color="#ffff00">she just loses all structure.
Just sort of like...</font>

775
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,840
<font color="#ffff00">Just flopping about all over the place,
going, "Oh, what does, furniture?"</font>

776
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,840
<font color="#ffff00">Sidesaddle, tits akimbo.</font>

777
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,800
<font color="#ffff00">No wonder we can't reverse park, ladies!</font>

778
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,360
<font color="#ffff00">Dumb history women couldn't even
reverse park their arse onto a chair!</font>

00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,920
<font color="#ffff00">Another thing I do
that's not very ladylike</font>

780
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,960
<font color="#ffff00">is every day I seem to be able to finish
the getting of the dressed.</font>

781
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,040
<font color="#ffff00">Every day!</font>

782
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,760
<font color="#ffff00">Not a problem.
All the buttons, all the way up.</font>

783
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,120
<font color="#ffff00">I'm quite a vague
and forgetful person, but...</font>

784
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,200
<font color="#ffff00">Seem to do it quite easily.</font>

785
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,760
<font color="#ffff00">Especially if I'm leaving the house
to get my portrait painted.</font>

786
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,280
<font color="#ffff00">Never once have I thought,
"You know what, today,</font>

787
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,400
<font color="#ffff00">I must just leave a cheeky one out."</font>

788
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,400
<font color="#ffff00">High art.</font>

789
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,640
<font color="#ffff00">I'm going to call it, guys.</font>

790
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:01,720
<font color="#ffff00">Bullshit.</font>

791
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,520
<font color="#ffff00">High art, my arse.</font>

792
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,000
<font color="#ffff00">The history of western art is just
the history of men painting women</font>

793
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,000
<font color="#ffff00">like they're flesh vases
for their dick flowers.</font>

794
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,680
<font color="#ffff00">Having... said that,</font>

795
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,560
<font color="#ffff00">I think I've ruined any chance
of getting a job in a gallery now.</font>

796
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:28,240
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, I could pay
to be a volunteer guide.</font>

797
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,640
<font color="#ffff00">'Cause it doesn't get any better
with modern art, I tell you.</font>

798
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,600
<font color="#ffff00">I trip on the first hurdle. Pablo Picasso.
I hate him, but you're not allowed to.</font>

799
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,600
<font color="#ffff00">I hate him.</font>

800
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,880
<font color="#ffff00">But you can't. Cubism.</font>

801
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,840
<font color="#ffff00">And if you ruin... cubism,</font>

802
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,360
<font color="#ffff00">then civilization as we know it
will crumble.</font>

803
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:51,720
<font color="#ffff00">Cubism.
Aren't we grateful... in this room...</font>

804
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,200
<font color="#ffff00">that we live in a post-cubism world?</font>

805
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,480
<font color="#ffff00">Isn't that the first thing we all write in
our gratitude journals? "Oh, thank god."</font>

806
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,240
<font color="#ffff00">I don't like Picasso. I fucking hate him.</font>

807
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:10,240
<font color="#ffff00">I really-- I just--
He's rotten in the face cavity.</font>

808
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:13,840
<font color="#ffff00">I hate Picasso! I hate him!
And you can't make me like--</font>

809
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,840
<font color="#ffff00">But you get it a lot: "Oh, cubism..."</font>

810
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,480
<font color="#ffff00">And I know I should be more generous
about him too</font>

811
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,560
<font color="#ffff00">because he suffered a mental illness.</font>

812
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,080
<font color="#ffff00">But you see, nobody knows that.
Because it doesn't fit with his mythology.</font>

813
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">They go, "I think you're thinking
of Van Gogh."</font>

814
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,720
<font color="#ffff00">No, I'm thinking about them all,
actually...</font>

815
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,480
<font color="#ffff00">Because Picasso, he's sold to us</font>

816
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:38,960
<font color="#ffff00">as this passionate, virile,
tormented genius, man, ball sack, right?</font>

817
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,440
<font color="#ffff00">There's no room in that story for...
is there?</font>

818
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,600
<font color="#ffff00">-[audience member] No.
-No. It's rhetorical, but...</font>

819
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:46,600
<font color="#ffff00">There's a...</font>

820
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,080
<font color="#ffff00">But he did suffer a mental illness.
Picasso did.</font>

821
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,040
<font color="#ffff00">He suffered badly
and it got worse as he got older.</font>

822
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,200
<font color="#ffff00">Picasso suffered... the mental illness
of misogyny.</font>

823
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,640
<font color="#ffff00">Split the room.</font>

824
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,000
<font color="#ffff00">Didn't I?
And I bet you I know how that felt.</font>

825
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,320
<font color="#ffff00">Is misogyny a mental illness?</font>

826
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,200
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah.</font>

827
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,680
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, it is!
Especially if you're a heterosexual man.</font>

828
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:22,880
<font color="#ffff00">Because if you hate what you desire,
do you know what that is?</font>

829
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,800
<font color="#ffff00">Fucking tense!</font>

830
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,880
<font color="#ffff00">Sort your shit out.
Yeah, he did suffer from a mental illness.</font>

831
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,760
<font color="#ffff00">Smarter men than I have proved he didn't
suffer a mental illness, but they're--</font>

832
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:35,760
<font color="#ffff00">No, they're wrong.</font>

833
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,640
<font color="#ffff00">They'd say he's not a misogynist.
They're wrong. He was.</font>

834
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,440
<font color="#ffff00">If you don't believe me,
let me provide you a quote</font>

835
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,240
<font color="#ffff00">from Picky Asshole himself.</font>

836
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,360
<font color="#ffff00">He said, "Each time... I leave a woman,
I should burn her.</font>

837
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,160
<font color="#ffff00">Destroy the woman,
you destroy the past she represents."</font>

838
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:55,760
<font color="#ffff00">Cool guy.</font>

839
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,640
<font color="#ffff00">The greatest artist
of the twentieth century.</font>

840
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:04,400
<font color="#ffff00">Let's make art great again, guys.</font>

841
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,680
<font color="#ffff00">Picasso fucked an underage girl.</font>

842
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,480
<font color="#ffff00">And that's it for me. Not interested.</font>

843
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,680
<font color="#ffff00">"But cubism...</font>

844
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,760
<font color="#ffff00">We need it."</font>

845
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,600
<font color="#ffff00">Marie-Thérèse Walter.
She was 17 when they met. Underage.</font>

846
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,800
<font color="#ffff00">Legally underage. Picasso was 42,
married, at the height of his career.</font>

847
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,600
<font color="#ffff00">Does it matter? Yeah.</font>

848
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,120
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, it actually does.</font>

849
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,480
<font color="#ffff00">It does matter.</font>

850
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:42,280
<font color="#ffff00">But as Picasso said, no, it was perfect.
I was in my prime, she was in her prime.</font>

851
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,000
<font color="#ffff00">I probably read that when I was 17.
Do you know how grim that was?</font>

852
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,720
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, I'm in my prime!</font>

853
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,240
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, there is no view at my peak.</font>

854
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:01,720
<font color="#ffff00">But I wasn't upset at the time,
because I was learning about cubism!</font>

855
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,480
<font color="#ffff00">Now, I should qualify this, though.</font>

856
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,000
<font color="#ffff00">Cubism is important.</font>

857
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,240
<font color="#ffff00">You know, it really is.
It was a real game-changer.</font>

858
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,320
<font color="#ffff00">Picasso freed us from slavery, people.
He really did.</font>

859
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,600
<font color="#ffff00">He freed us from the slavery
of having to reproduce</font>

860
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,680
<font color="#ffff00">believable three-dimensional reality
on a two-dimensional surface.</font>

861
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,760
<font color="#ffff00">Three-point perspective,
that illusion that gives us</font>

862
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,200
<font color="#ffff00">the idea of a single stable world view,
a single perspective?</font>

863
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,200
<font color="#ffff00">Picasso said, "No!</font>

864
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,040
<font color="#ffff00">Run free! You can have all perspectives.
That's what we need.</font>

865
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,640
<font color="#ffff00">From above, from below,
inside out, the sides.</font>

866
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,480
<font color="#ffff00">All the perspectives at once!"</font>

867
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,760
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you, Picasso.</font>

868
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:42,600
<font color="#ffff00">What a guy.</font>

869
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
<font color="#ffff00">What a hero. Thank you. But tell me,</font>

870
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,560
<font color="#ffff00">any of those perspectives a woman's?</font>

871
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,440
<font color="#ffff00">No. Well, I'm not fucking interested.</font>

872
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,480
<font color="#ffff00">You just put a kaleidoscope filter
on your cock.</font>

873
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:56,160
<font color="#ffff00">You're still painting flesh vases
for your dick flowers.</font>

874
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:04,520
<font color="#ffff00">Separate the man from the art.
That's what I keep hearing.</font>

875
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,440
<font color="#ffff00">You've got to learn to separate the man
from the art.</font>

876
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,680
<font color="#ffff00">The art is important, not the artist.</font>

877
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,720
<font color="#ffff00">You've got to learn to separate the man
from the art.</font>

878
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,880
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, all right. Okay. Let's give it a go.</font>

879
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,120
<font color="#ffff00">How about you take Picasso's name
off his little paintings</font>

880
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,320
<font color="#ffff00">and see how much his doodles are worth
at auction?</font>

881
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,400
<font color="#ffff00">Fucking nothing!
Nobody owns a circular Lego nude,</font>

882
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,920
<font color="#ffff00">they own a Picasso!</font>

883
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,680
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry.</font>

884
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:34,920
<font color="#ffff00">You won't hear too many extended sets
about art history in a comedy show, so...</font>

885
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,680
<font color="#ffff00">you're welcome.</font>

886
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,680
<font color="#ffff00">And it's bold, I know.</font>

887
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:46,520
<font color="#ffff00">Comedy is more used to throwaway jokes
about priests being pedophiles</font>

888
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,600
<font color="#ffff00">and Trump grabbing the pussy.</font>

889
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,920
<font color="#ffff00">I don't have time for that shit.</font>

890
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,840
<font color="#ffff00">I don't.</font>

891
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,040
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know who used to be
an easy punch line?</font>

892
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:57,840
<font color="#ffff00">Monica Lewinsky.</font>

893
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,680
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe, if comedians had done
their job properly,</font>

894
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,440
<font color="#ffff00">and made fun of the man
who abused his power,</font>

895
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:06,800
<font color="#ffff00">then perhaps we might have had
a middle-aged woman</font>

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,520
<font color="#ffff00">with an appropriate amount of experience
in the White House,</font>

897
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,200
<font color="#ffff00">instead of, as we do,
a man who openly admitted</font>

898
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:15,920
<font color="#ffff00">to sexually assaulting
vulnerable young women because he could.</font>

00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:22,680
<font color="#ffff00">[cheering continues]</font>

901
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:30,680
<font color="#ffff00">Do you know what should be the target
of our jokes at the moment?</font>

902
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,080
<font color="#ffff00">Our obsession with reputation.</font>

903
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,360
<font color="#ffff00">We're obsessed. We think reputation
is more important than anything else,</font>

904
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,160
<font color="#ffff00">including humanity.</font>

905
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,920
<font color="#ffff00">And do you know who takes the mantle
of this myopic adulation</font>

906
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,520
<font color="#ffff00">of reputation?</font>

907

<font color="#ffff00">Celebrities. And comedians are not immune.</font>

908
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,720
<font color="#ffff00">They're all cut from the same cloth.</font>

909
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,960
<font color="#ffff00">Donald Trump, Pablo Picasso,</font>

910
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:55,600
<font color="#ffff00">Harvey Weinstein,</font>

911
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,800
<font color="#ffff00">Bill Cosby, Woody Allen, Roman Polanski.</font>

912
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:02,920
<font color="#ffff00">These men are not exceptions,
they are the rule.</font>

913
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,520
<font color="#ffff00">And they are not individuals,
they are our stories.</font>

914
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,360
<font color="#ffff00">And the moral of our story is,
"We don't give a shit.</font>

915
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,440
<font color="#ffff00">We don't give a fuck...
about women or children.</font>

916
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,680
<font color="#ffff00">We only care about a man's reputation."</font>

917
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,240
<font color="#ffff00">What about his humanity?</font>

918
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,760
<font color="#ffff00">These men control our stories!</font>

919
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,200
<font color="#ffff00">And yet they have a diminishing connection
to their own humanity,</font>

920
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,000
<font color="#ffff00">and we don't seem to mind</font>

921
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,600
<font color="#ffff00">so long as they get
to hold onto their precious reputation.</font>

922
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,520
<font color="#ffff00">Fuck reputation. Hindsight is a gift.</font>

923
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,200
<font color="#ffff00">Stop wasting my time!</font>

924
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,760
<font color="#ffff00">If you...</font>

925
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,920
<font color="#ffff00">Look, I am angry.</font>

926
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,000
<font color="#ffff00">I apologize.</font>

927
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,040
<font color="#ffff00">I do, I apologize. I know...</font>

928
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,520
<font color="#ffff00">I know there's a few people in the room
going, "Now, look...</font>

929
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,760
<font color="#ffff00">I think... she's lost control
of the tension."</font>

930
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,920
<font color="#ffff00">That's correct. I went on it a bit there.</font>

931
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,920
<font color="#ffff00">So, I'm not very experienced
in controlling anger.</font>

932
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,440
<font color="#ffff00">It's not my place to be angry on
a comedy stage. I'm meant to be doing...</font>

933
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,000
<font color="#ffff00">self-deprecating humor.</font>

934
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,760
<font color="#ffff00">People feel safer
when men do the angry comedy.</font>

935
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,440
<font color="#ffff00">They're the kings of the genre.</font>

936
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,160
<font color="#ffff00">When I do it, I'm a miserable lesbian,
ruining all the fun and the banter.</font>

937
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:23,080
<font color="#ffff00">When men do it, heroes of free speech.</font>

938
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,680
<font color="#ffff00">I love... angry white man comedy.</font>

939
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,320
<font color="#ffff00">It's so funny, it's hilarious.</font>

940
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,560
<font color="#ffff00">They're adorable. Why are they angry?</font>

941
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,120
<font color="#ffff00">What's up, little fella?</font>

942
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,240
<font color="#ffff00">What are they angry about?
Gosh, can't work it out.</font>

943
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,920
<font color="#ffff00">They're like the canaries in the mine,
aren't they?</font>

944
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,120
<font color="#ffff00">If they're having a tough time...</font>

945
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,040
<font color="#ffff00">the rest of us are goners.</font>

946
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,480
<font color="#ffff00">Do you remember that story about
that young man who almost beat me up?</font>

947
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,040
<font color="#ffff00">It was a very funny story.</font>

948
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,160
<font color="#ffff00">It was very funny, I made a lot of people
laugh about his ignorance,</font>

949
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,560
<font color="#ffff00">and the reason I could do that is because
I'm very good at this job.</font>

950
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,320
<font color="#ffff00">I actually am pretty good
at controlling the tension.</font>

951
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:12,720
<font color="#ffff00">And I know how to balance that
to get the laugh at the right place.</font>

952
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,120
<font color="#ffff00">But in order to balance the tension
in the room with that story,</font>

953
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:18,760
<font color="#ffff00">I couldn't tell that story
as it actually happened.</font>

954
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,600
<font color="#ffff00">Because I couldn't tell the part of the
story where that man realized his mistake.</font>

955
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,480
<font color="#ffff00">And he came back.</font>

956
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,000
<font color="#ffff00">And he said, "Oh, no, I get it.</font>

957
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,920
<font color="#ffff00">You're a lady faggot.</font>

958
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,600
<font color="#ffff00">I'm allowed to beat the shit out of you,"
and he did!</font>

959
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,720
<font color="#ffff00">He beat the shit out of me
and nobody stopped him.</font>

960
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,600
<font color="#ffff00">And I didn't... report that to the police,</font>

961
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,880
<font color="#ffff00">and I did not take myself to hospital,
and I should have.</font>

962
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,040
<font color="#ffff00">And you know why I didn't?</font>

963
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,840
<font color="#ffff00">It's because I thought
that was all I was worth.</font>

964
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,920
<font color="#ffff00">And that is what happens
when you soak one child in shame</font>

965
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,920
<font color="#ffff00">and give permission to another to hate.</font>

966
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,840
<font color="#ffff00">And that was not homophobia, pure
and simple, people. That was gendered.</font>

967
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,240
<font color="#ffff00">If I'd been feminine,
that would not have happened.</font>

968
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,560
<font color="#ffff00">I am incorrectly female.</font>

969
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:17,040
<font color="#ffff00">I am incorrect,
and that is a punishable offense.</font>

970
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,400
<font color="#ffff00">And this tension, it's yours.
I am not helping you anymore.</font>

971
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,520
<font color="#ffff00">You need to learn what this feels like
because this... this tension</font>

972
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,600
<font color="#ffff00">is what not-normals carry inside of them
all of the time</font>

973
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,040
<font color="#ffff00">because it is dangerous to be different!</font>

974
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,720
<font color="#ffff00">To the men...</font>

975
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,320
<font color="#ffff00">to the men in the room, I speak to you
now, particularly the white men,</font>

976
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,120
<font color="#ffff00">especially the straight white men.</font>

977
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,600
<font color="#ffff00">Pull your fucking socks up!</font>

978
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:49,160
<font color="#ffff00">How humiliating!</font>

979
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
<font color="#ffff00">Fashion advice from a lesbian.</font>

980
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,840
<font color="#ffff00">That is your last joke.</font>

981
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,000
<font color="#ffff00">All my life,</font>

982
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,360
<font color="#ffff00">I've been told that I'm a man-hater.</font>

983
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,800
<font color="#ffff00">I don't hate men, I honestly do not.</font>

984
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:17,520
<font color="#ffff00">I don't hate men.</font>

985
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,560
<font color="#ffff00">But...</font>

986
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:24,360
<font color="#ffff00">there's a problem.</font>

987
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,440
<font color="#ffff00">See, I don't even believe that women
are better than men.</font>

988
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:33,840
<font color="#ffff00">I believe women are just as corruptible
by power as men,</font>

989
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,320
<font color="#ffff00">because you know what, fellas, you don't
have a monopoly on the human condition,</font>

990
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:39,640
<font color="#ffff00">you arrogant fucks.</font>

991
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,160
<font color="#ffff00">But the story is as you have told it.</font>

992
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,320
<font color="#ffff00">Power belongs to you.</font>

993
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,280
<font color="#ffff00">And if you can't handle criticism,</font>

994
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,720
<font color="#ffff00">take a joke,</font>

995
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:53,400
<font color="#ffff00">or deal with your own tension
without violence,</font>

996
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:55,880
<font color="#ffff00">you have to wonder
if you are up to the task</font>

997
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,560
<font color="#ffff00">of being in charge.</font>

998
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,960
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not a man-hater.
But I'm afraid of men.</font>

999
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,920
<font color="#ffff00">If I'm the only woman
in a room full of men, I am afraid.</font>

1000
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,920
<font color="#ffff00">And if you think that's unusual, you're
not speaking to the women in your life.</font>

1001
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,560
<font color="#ffff00">I don't hate men, but I wonder how
a man would feel if they'd lived my life.</font>

1002
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,240
<font color="#ffff00">Because it was a man who sexually
abused me when I was a child.</font>

1003
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:23,880
<font color="#ffff00">It was a man who beat the shit out of me
when I was 17, my prime.</font>

1004
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,680
<font color="#ffff00">It was two men who raped me
when I was barely in my twenties.</font>

1005
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:30,960
<font color="#ffff00">Tell me why is that okay.</font>

1006
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:35,400
<font color="#ffff00">Why was it okay to pick me off the pack
like that and do that to me?</font>

1007
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,080
<font color="#ffff00">It would have been more humane to just
take me out to the back paddock</font>

1008
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,760
<font color="#ffff00">and put a bullet in my head</font>

1009
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,920
<font color="#ffff00">if it is that much of a crime
to be different!</font>

1010
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,040
<font color="#ffff00">I don't tell you this...</font>

1011
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,080
<font color="#ffff00">so you think of me as a victim.</font>

1012
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:56,200
<font color="#ffff00">I am not a victim. I tell you this
because my story has value.</font>

1013
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,720
<font color="#ffff00">My story has value.</font>

1014
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:04,160
<font color="#ffff00">I tell you this 'cause I want you to know,
I need you to know, what I know.</font>

1015
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,440
<font color="#ffff00">To be rendered powerless
does not destroy your humanity.</font>

1016
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,600
<font color="#ffff00">Your resilience is your humanity.</font>

1017
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:14,440
<font color="#ffff00">The only people who lose their humanity
are those who believe they have the right</font>

1018
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,040
<font color="#ffff00">to render another human being powerless.</font>

1019
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:18,480
<font color="#ffff00">They are the weak.</font>

1020
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,120
<font color="#ffff00">To yield and not break,
that is incredible strength.</font>

1021
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,800
<font color="#ffff00">You destroy the woman,
you destroy the past she represents.</font>

1022
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:32,600
<font color="#ffff00">I will not allow my story...</font>

1023
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:34,960
<font color="#ffff00">to be destroyed.</font>

1024
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:38,600
<font color="#ffff00">What I would have done
to have heard a story like mine.</font>

1025
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,840
<font color="#ffff00">Not for blame.</font>

1026
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,040
<font color="#ffff00">Not for reputation, not for money,
not for power.</font>

1027
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,920
<font color="#ffff00">But to feel less alone.</font>

1028
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,200
<font color="#ffff00">To feel connected.</font>

1029
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,880
<font color="#ffff00">I want my story... heard.</font>

1030
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,520
<font color="#ffff00">Because, ironically,
I believe Picasso was right.</font>

1031
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,240
<font color="#ffff00">I believe we could paint a better world</font>

1032
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,760
<font color="#ffff00">if we learned how to see it
from all perspectives,</font>

1033
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,520
<font color="#ffff00">as many perspectives as we possibly could.</font>

1034
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,360
<font color="#ffff00">Because diversity is strength.</font>

1035
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,680
<font color="#ffff00">Difference is a teacher.</font>

1036
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:14,160
<font color="#ffff00">Fear difference, you learn nothing.</font>
