[crowd cheering]

4
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:32,967
Thank you.

5
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,387
Thank you so much, everybody.
Thank you for clapping.

6
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:38,556
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

7
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,391
Thanks.

8
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:42,877
Thanks a lot.

9
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:47,231
Thank you. That's cool.

10
00:00:47,265 --> 00:00:49,609
All right.

11
00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:51,903
This is a good crowd.
This is...

12
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:55,448
All right. Thank you.
That guy has a high voice.

13
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:58,702
- [laughter]
- [laughs]

14
00:00:58,736 --> 00:01:00,411
All right, I got a lot of jokes,
so I'm just gonna start

15
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,414
telling them. Here we go.

16
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,584
I went to a baseball game
last summer in a stadium

17
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:10,421
and they had a huge TV
in the stadium. A Jumbotron.

18
00:01:10,455 --> 00:01:14,592
And this guy proposed to his
girlfriend using the giant TV.

19
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:16,969
He put her name up there,
said, "Will you marry me?"

20
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:19,472
She said yes.
The crowd went wild.

21
00:01:19,506 --> 00:01:21,808
They found the couple
in the audience.

22
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:24,268
I was sitting there thinking,
"God, that's so romantic.

23
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:26,730
That's so cool."
And then I remembered thinking,

24
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:29,440
you know, you could also
use a screen like that

25
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:32,802
if you're having trouble
breaking up with somebody.

26
00:01:34,354 --> 00:01:36,030
Be like, "Hey, I'm gonna
grab a hot dog.

27
00:01:36,064 --> 00:01:39,183
But you should definitely
look at that screen."

28
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,817
That's a smooth way out of it.

29
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,462
I think my favorite sign
that I've seen

30
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:54,883
is "Bridge May Be Icy."

31
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:57,260
'Cause it's so honest, you know?
It's just like,

32
00:01:57,294 --> 00:02:01,639
"Bridge... may be,
I don't know. I'm...

33
00:02:01,673 --> 00:02:04,768
...a sign. I don't have
a conscious mind. I'm...

34
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:06,561
...a tilted yellow square.

35
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:08,438
What are these shapes
on the front of me?

36
00:02:08,472 --> 00:02:09,981
I mean, bridge may be chocolate.
Whatever you want.

37
00:02:10,015 --> 00:02:12,984
I don't care."

38
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:14,945
"Bridge may not be icy."

39
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:16,821
That means the same thing
as "Bridge may be icy."

40
00:02:16,855 --> 00:02:19,991
That's... even better, you know?
More optimistic.

41
00:02:20,025 --> 00:02:22,911
That's a better sign.

42
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:27,039
"Bridge may not be icy."
Hey, I like your attitude, sign.

43
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:31,586
"Bridge probably not icy.
Give it a shot." Even better.

44
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,947
It's August, bridge probably
not icy. You're right.

45
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,094
One sign I don't like
is "Please use other door."

46
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:44,040
You're a fucking door,
you don't get to take a break.

47
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:49,604
Just be a door.
Just swing.

48
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:53,007
This door thinks it's a wall.
This is ridiculous.

49
00:02:54,518 --> 00:02:56,527
When I see
"Please use other door,"

50
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,614
I wish I had a sign with me
to put on the other door

51
00:02:59,648 --> 00:03:03,534
that says "No, no, no.
Use... first door.

52
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,745
First door pulling bullshit.
First door lazy.

53
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,705
Use first door. Trust me,

54
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,666
find way to use first door."
Yeah. Okay.

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,876
[chuckles]

56
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,503
I like that sign
"Beware of dog."

57
00:03:13,537 --> 00:03:15,379
I saw that at Staples,
they had them.

58
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:16,756
They look really professional.

59
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,800
I just wanted
to buy a pile of them.

60
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,136
Just put 'em up
in stupid places, you know?

61
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,808
Like... like in the men's room
of a fancy restaurant.

62
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:28,685
Guy gets up to go
to the bathroom,

63
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,980
"Oh, shit. There's a...

64
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:35,383
There's a dog in the men's room.
I think I'm..."

65
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:40,571
Just hang one
around a dog's neck.

66
00:03:40,605 --> 00:03:42,740
What a vicious, considerate
poodle we have here.

67
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:45,409
Look at that.

68
00:03:45,443 --> 00:03:48,329
Or maybe, you know,
like if you get a massage,

69
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,540
they lay you down
on that table,

70
00:03:50,574 --> 00:03:53,626
and there's a hole
that you look through.

71
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,714
Just centered under the hole
on the floor.

72
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,340
Guy's like, "Oh, I'm gonna
get a massage. Great.

73
00:03:59,374 --> 00:04:02,468
Oh, shit.

74
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:05,137
There's a freaking dog
in this room."

75
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:08,916
Pets are animals
that are not delicious.

76
00:04:11,011 --> 00:04:12,896
I don't think that
was by mistake.

77
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,815
I think we probably
tried to eat all of them.

78
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:18,150
Like, "Okay, these don't taste
good, so we'll give these

79
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:21,278
first names and sweaters
and we'll hang out with them.

80
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:24,824
And then, uh, let's eat
the rest. Let's eat these."

81
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:28,244
[laughs]

82
00:04:28,278 --> 00:04:30,663
We even eat birds. I can't
believe we eat birds.

83
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:32,373
How did that start? Somebody
was like, "You see that

84
00:04:32,407 --> 00:04:33,499
flying up there?

85
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:36,920
I wanna put that in my mouth.

86
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,922
Yeah, that looks good."
"It's covered in feathers."

87
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,006
"No, no, no.
I'll do some shit to it.

88
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,533
I'll make it good."

89
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:44,969
"What if it doesn't taste good?"

90
00:04:45,003 --> 00:04:46,137
"Well, then I'll capture it,

91
00:04:46,171 --> 00:04:47,471
and I'll put it in a cage

92
00:04:47,505 --> 00:04:50,016
and it'll live in my kitchen.

93
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,710
And I'll have it shit
on old news."

94
00:04:54,763 --> 00:04:57,607
I think we're mean
to birds, man. Like...

95
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,693
I mean, turkeys,
we break the wishbone.

96
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:03,738
We've killed the bird,
we've cooked it,

97
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,865
and we've eaten it.
Then we're like,

98
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:10,494
"You wanna break
its fucking bones, man?"

99
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,706
"Yeah. Yeah, let's...
let's break its bones, man.

100
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,025
We'll make a wish."

101
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:18,461
"What did you wish for?"

102
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:21,447
"Death to all turkeys."

103
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,761
It seems like there's
a fine line between having a pet

104
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:30,848
and having a hostage
from a different species.

105
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,767
You go to somebody's house,
they're like, "Close the door.

106
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,211
He'll get out. Close the door!
He'll get out!"

107
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:39,857
Okay.

108
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:43,344
What kind of relationship do you
have with this dog exactly?

109
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:47,031
Owner walks away,
the dog's like... [pants]

110
00:05:47,065 --> 00:05:49,867
"He's not looking. Open
the door, let me out. Come on.

111
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:53,830
I can't shit when I want to.
Open this door!

112
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,957
This woman put sunglasses
on me last week.

113
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:57,500
I'm gonna eat her
when she's sleeping if you don't

114
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:59,627
open the goddamn door
right now."

115
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:02,630
I saw a poster that said
"Missing cat."

116
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:05,883
They had a picture of the cat
and a whole description.

117
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:07,969
Missing, huh?

118
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:11,121
I think that's
from the human perspective.

119
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:15,018
The cat made that poster,
it would say, "Free cat.

120
00:06:15,052 --> 00:06:19,355
Finally." Picture of the cat
would be like...

121
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,732
"Cat is hunter, cat gets own
food, cat has no first name,

122
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,567
don't look for cat, fuck off,
leave cat alone, fuck off."

123
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:28,055
Okay, cat, we get it. Jesus.

124
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,203
The hairless cat,
that's a weird looking animal.

125
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:34,954
Looks like somebody
procrastinated when they were

126
00:06:34,988 --> 00:06:37,957
designing animals or something.

127
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:40,751
Like, "Okay, animals
are due for earth today."

128
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:43,546
"I thought they
were due Monday."

129
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,507
"No, they're due today."

130
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:48,968
"Oh, shit. Uh...

131
00:06:49,002 --> 00:06:51,829
Yeah, no, I am finished. Uh...

132
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,308
It's, uh...

133
00:06:56,342 --> 00:06:58,978
The hairless cat,
what do you think?"

134
00:06:59,012 --> 00:07:00,688
"I think it looks
like a meth addict.

135
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:03,173
Let's see what God says,
come on."

136
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:09,239
I wonder what the hairless cat
looks like to regular cats.

137
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:12,850
Just walks by
and they're like, "Whore."

138
00:07:18,907 --> 00:07:21,167
I've learned that there's a fine
line between killing a fly

139
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:24,278
and applauding a fly.

140
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,757
There was one in my living room,
I was trying to kill it.

141
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:30,218
But I was too slow.
So was I just...

142
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:32,803
...following the fly
around my house,

143
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:36,307
clapping for it.

144
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:40,186
Sending the exact wrong message
to the fly.

145
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,772
He's like, "Oh, this guy, uh...
he likes what I'm doing.

146
00:07:42,806 --> 00:07:45,316
Huh, you like that?

147
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,610
You think that's impressive,
let me fly right up to your face

148
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:50,571
give you a close-up
of some of this.

149
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:53,783
Oh, now he's waving at me."

150
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,952
I have an L-shaped sofa.

151
00:07:55,986 --> 00:07:58,437
Lowercase.

152
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:04,443
- [applause]
- Thanks.

153
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:13,970
Soap scum seems like a really
harsh term for that stuff.

154
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:17,640
Maybe we overreacted
a little bit with that one.

155
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,642
"Look at this soap scum."

156
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:20,977
"I think that's just
dried soap, man."

157
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:22,645
"No.

158
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:25,464
This shit betrayed me.

159
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:31,403
This used to help me clean,
now I have to clean it?

160
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:33,948
It's the lowest form
of soap there is, man.

161
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:36,183
You're looking at scum
right there."

162
00:08:38,403 --> 00:08:40,579
When I was little,
I learned that "please"

163
00:08:40,613 --> 00:08:42,539
was the magic word.

164
00:08:42,573 --> 00:08:44,208
Then I got a little older,
and I learned that "abracadabra"

165
00:08:44,242 --> 00:08:46,377
was the magic word.

166
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,338
Then I learned that they're
never interchangeable,

167
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:51,281
under any circumstances.

168
00:08:53,543 --> 00:08:55,845
"For you, sir."
"I will have the grilled cheese

169
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,015
with tomato, abracadabra."

170
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:03,311
"Okay, here's your
grilled cheese. Enjoy."

171
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:05,271
"Will you abracadabra
just look at me

172
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:08,232
when I'm talking to you?"

173
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,218
"Bitch, abracadabra."

174
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,659
And there's a fourth example,
but I can't say it

175
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,828
'cause I'm a white comedian.

176
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:23,914
[laughter]

177
00:09:23,948 --> 00:09:26,609
Those are the rules.

178
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:32,448
White privilege does not extend
onto the stage, you see.

179
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,969
One thing you don't see
that often is a black magician.

180
00:09:37,003 --> 00:09:39,763
There aren't that many
black magicians.

181
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:42,599
Probably because of racism.

182
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:44,394
If a black guy makes something
disappear, they're like,

183
00:09:44,428 --> 00:09:46,545
"Hey, get him!"

184
00:09:48,848 --> 00:09:51,634
"It's magic."
"No, you're black."

185
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,987
White guy can make
a whole woman disappear.

186
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:56,155
They're like, "Ah, she's fine.
He's white.

187
00:09:56,189 --> 00:09:59,158
Don't worry about it."

188
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:02,870
People get so mad when you run
and try to catch the elevator.

189
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:04,621
I can't get over how angry
they get.

190
00:10:04,655 --> 00:10:06,374
What they really hate
is when you run and catch it

191
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:07,417
and you go, "I just wanna say
hey, everybody.

192
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,443
Have a good ride. Okay?"

193
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:12,463
They don't like that.

194
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:15,091
People are crabby in elevators.

195
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,802
One time I was in an elevator
and I hit the wrong floor.

196
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:21,138
And then I hit my floor.

197
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:23,933
And people looked at me
like I stabbed a baby

198
00:10:23,967 --> 00:10:25,517
in front of them or something.
I just...

199
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:28,479
I just made a mistake, you know?

200
00:10:28,513 --> 00:10:31,065
Longest moment of my life was
when we got to the first floor

201
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:33,234
that I hit...

202
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:36,404
The doors opened, and nobody
got on, nobody got off.

203
00:10:36,438 --> 00:10:39,823
I was like...
[humming nervously]

204
00:10:39,857 --> 00:10:41,492
The elevator was like,
"Oh, this asshole messed up.

205
00:10:41,526 --> 00:10:45,455
I'm gonna stay open
extra long."

206
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:48,082
I had to, like, improvise
some sort of a cover, you know?

207
00:10:48,116 --> 00:10:51,835
I just leaned out, I was like,
"Bobby? Pssh.

208
00:10:51,869 --> 00:10:55,839
He said he was gonna met me
on four. That's weird.

209
00:10:55,873 --> 00:10:58,617
[makes farting sound]
Anyway..."

210
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:02,596
If you ask somebody how they're
doing, sometimes they'll say,

211
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:05,475
"A-OK." It's like
they're giving you the beginning

212
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:08,794
of a weird multiple choice
answer or something.

213
00:11:10,514 --> 00:11:13,399
"How you doing?"
"A-OK.

214
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:16,635
B-suicidal. Uh...

215
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:21,031
C-horny." "Okay,
I think I'm gonna head out."

216
00:11:21,065 --> 00:11:23,893
"D-all of the above.
Hold on."

217
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,123
I was in the supermarket

218
00:11:29,157 --> 00:11:31,041
and I saw they
had prune juice for sale.

219
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:33,461
And I had to stop 'cause I was
like, "Prune juice?

220
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:36,880
I thought prunes
were dried plums.

221
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:40,134
What the hell is prune juice?

222
00:11:40,168 --> 00:11:44,263
How hard are we squeezing
these prunes?"

223
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:45,806
"Come on, you little shit.
We'll get some juice out of you.

224
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,933
Come on."

225
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,060
"Okay, that's 97 prunes,
we have one glass.

226
00:11:50,094 --> 00:11:53,230
Should we keep going?"

227
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:57,234
There's no such thing
as prune juice. That's bullshit.

228
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:59,487
That's plum juice.
That's the reason you're a prune

229
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,989
is that we took the juice
from the plum, leaving you.

230
00:12:02,023 --> 00:12:04,908
And then you took credit...

231
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:09,563
...calling it your juice?
What a dick move, prunes.

232
00:12:10,698 --> 00:12:13,901
I've never seen raisin juice
for sale.

233
00:12:18,415 --> 00:12:20,508
Prunes are pushy.
I mean, that's their nature.

234
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:23,302
You eat a prune... [laughs]

235
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:26,305
- That's like...
- [applause]

236
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,098
...sending a cop
into your stomach

237
00:12:28,132 --> 00:12:30,226
to break up the party.

238
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,685
Food's digesting, having
a good time, you eat a prune.

239
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:32,978
"Lights on. Let's go.
Everybody out.

240
00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:36,106
Come on, move. We gotta go. Go."

241
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,483
Piece of broccoli,
"My friend's still in there."

242
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:38,650
"I don't give
a shit. No pun intended.

243
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,444
We gotta clear the room."

244
00:12:40,478 --> 00:12:44,098
Freaking prunes.
You ruin everything.

245
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:49,161
I like French toast way better
than toast.

246
00:12:49,195 --> 00:12:53,123
I think a French kiss
is nicer than just a plain kiss.

247
00:12:53,157 --> 00:12:55,501
So I guess the rule is
if you make something French,

248
00:12:55,535 --> 00:12:57,503
- you make it better.
- [woman cheers]

249
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:02,199
- Except for people.
- [laughter, applause]

250
00:13:06,212 --> 00:13:08,514
It's the...
it's the one exception.

251
00:13:08,548 --> 00:13:10,558
But, you know... [laughs]

252
00:13:10,592 --> 00:13:12,059
I'm just saying
they're not better.

253
00:13:12,093 --> 00:13:13,143
They're equal,
they're the same as us.

254
00:13:13,177 --> 00:13:15,145
French people...

255
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,648
A souvenir is a funny thing
to me.

256
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:20,317
What an interesting concept.
It's like, "Hey,

257
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,528
I got you something to remember
the time I went to Paris

258
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,805
and you didn't.

259
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,492
Yeah, put this on your mantle
so you can remember the time

260
00:13:28,526 --> 00:13:30,744
that I had a great vacation
and you stayed home

261
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:33,623
'cause you couldn't afford
to go. There you go, enjoy.

262
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:35,625
A piece of garbage
from another continent.

263
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:38,669
Do what you want with it."

264
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:40,212
I like airports, though,

265
00:13:40,246 --> 00:13:42,423
'cause they have
those flat escalators.

266
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,133
People never look more
like groceries

267
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:47,719
than when they're going
through an airport.

268
00:13:47,753 --> 00:13:50,640
Just going by. I wanna get one
of those rubber dividers

269
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:54,726
in the supermarket,
just put it on the thing there.

270
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,314
"This is my stuff,
that's your stuff.

271
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:02,134
Don't try to make me carry
your shit, okay? That's mine."

272
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,491
I don't like when I'm stopped
at a stoplight,

273
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:10,951
I'm sitting there in my car,
the light changes,

274
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,078
and people in the crosswalk,

275
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:15,414
and they don't, like,
hurry up to get out of the way.

276
00:14:15,448 --> 00:14:18,626
And sometimes it'll be
like a tough guy in the group,

277
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,753
and he'll, like,
slow down almost.

278
00:14:21,787 --> 00:14:24,298
Just to show how tough he is.
He's like looking at my car

279
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:27,718
like he's gonna fight it.
You know?

280
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:29,803
I think you should be able
to hit one person a year

281
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:34,291
- with your car.
- [laughter, applause]

282
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:38,187
Not to kill,
just to communicate.

283
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:41,398
Just to say, "Hey, you know,
it was my turn."

284
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:43,651
Then as he rolls over the top
of your car,

285
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,444
maybe he'd be thinking,
"God, this guy used

286
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:49,990
his one hit for the year on me.

287
00:14:50,024 --> 00:14:53,243
Maybe I'm a dick."

288
00:14:53,277 --> 00:14:55,078
Yeah.

289
00:14:55,112 --> 00:14:56,622
If I'm in the crosswalk
and the light changes,

290
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:59,375
I'm not saying I run
out of the way,

291
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:02,670
but I make a gesture
to the driver who's waiting

292
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:04,880
to let them know that I'm not
a dick. Know what I mean?

293
00:15:04,914 --> 00:15:06,590
The light changes, I don't run,
but I do a thing with my arms.

294
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:10,553
I go...

295
00:15:10,587 --> 00:15:12,429
Just so they can see,
"Oh, his torso's running. Look.

296
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:14,598
He's trying.
This guy's...

297
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:16,308
He's a good person.
You see that?

298
00:15:16,342 --> 00:15:20,229
The top half is considerate."

299
00:15:20,263 --> 00:15:21,438
I like that
at a lot of crosswalks

300
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:22,690
they have a countdown.

301
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:24,274
It's like they tell you exactly

302
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:25,484
when it will be funny to push

303
00:15:25,518 --> 00:15:27,737
your friend into traffic.

304
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:30,306
Just like, "Here we go."

305
00:15:31,775 --> 00:15:34,201
One time I was at a crosswalk
and I saw a guy

306
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:36,161
wearing the same shirt
that I was wearing.

307
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:38,622
It was kind of a specific shirt
and I looked at him,

308
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:41,584
and he was a dork.
Just like a dorky looking guy.

309
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:45,755
And I thought, I've got
the same taste as a dork.

310
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:48,840
That makes me a dork.
That sucks. You know?

311
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:51,510
Two months later,
I'm in a restaurant.

312
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:53,596
It happened again. I see a guy
wearing the same shirt

313
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,972
that I'm wearing,
but he was really good-looking.

314
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:58,392
He was with a beautiful woman.
And I just looked at him

315
00:15:58,426 --> 00:16:01,270
and I thought,
"I'm the dork."

316
00:16:01,304 --> 00:16:05,315
[laughter]

317
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:09,653
Can't win.

318
00:16:09,687 --> 00:16:12,448
I bought a box of crackers,
took out the first cracker,

319
00:16:12,482 --> 00:16:15,826
and I looked at it, it had holes
throughout the cracker.

320
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,829
I was trying to figure out,
why are there holes?

321
00:16:18,863 --> 00:16:23,500
For aerodynamics maybe?
Just... whoosh! Oh.

322
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:24,752
Look how quickly I can
eat these crackers.

323
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:26,962
[whooshing]

324
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:29,506
I'm so glad they perforated
them with that tiny drill press.

325
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,634
That's like [whooshing]

326
00:16:31,668 --> 00:16:35,745
Without those, ugh! Fucking wind
resistance on these crackers.

327
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:42,770
That joke never does well,
but I like it.

328
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:46,315
- So I don't give a shit.
- [applause]

329
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:48,233
I believe in it. You know,
there were like six people

330
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:50,486
in here who liked it,
so that's, you know,

331
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,446
that's my demographic
for the crackers joke.

332
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,057
And it's... I stand by it.

333
00:16:59,153 --> 00:17:00,579
How bad does a guess
have to be

334
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:03,732
for it to be
an uneducated guess?

335
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,127
"Do you know the temperature
outside?"

336
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:09,905
"Uh, carrots?"

337
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:15,344
"Did you say carrots?"

338
00:17:15,378 --> 00:17:18,639
"Yeah, I was just guessing.
I don't know, carrots?"

339
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:21,809
"Are you educated?"
"No. No, I'm not." "Okay.

340
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:25,688
Well, that makes sense because
it's never been carrots outside

341
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:28,315
and never will be carrots.
So you need to get an education,

342
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,233
go to school, then come back
to me, maybe you can

343
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:33,362
make an educated guess."

344
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:34,946
"Okay."

345
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,225
I wonder what a walrus vampire
would look like.

346
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:45,624
Probably a lot like the other
walruses, I don't know.

347
00:17:45,658 --> 00:17:50,504
Be hard to pick it out
of a crowd. [laughs]

348
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,507
I like the word "folks"
'cause it's so positive.

349
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,719
You know, black folks,
white folks, Asian folks.

350
00:17:56,753 --> 00:17:59,346
It's just got a good feel to it.
You never hear,

351
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,417
"I was at a party and these
fucking folks showed up.

352
00:18:05,845 --> 00:18:09,005
Folks are the worst, man."

353
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,276
You never hear on the news,
"22 folks were killed

354
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,821
when a bus hit a train."

355
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:19,015
"Oh, those poor folks!"

356
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:23,579
Quesadilla, that's a word
that you never

357
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,873
see the English translation for.
You never see that in English.

358
00:18:25,907 --> 00:18:28,542
You know? They just keep it
in Spanish.

359
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,002
I guess 'cause maybe it's too
awkward or something.

360
00:18:31,036 --> 00:18:34,297
You know, "And for you, sir?"
"I will have the quesa...

361
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:39,077
'cheese female small, ' please.

362
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:43,724
One little cheese girl for me,
that'd be great."

363
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,809
[chuckles]

364
00:18:45,843 --> 00:18:49,020
"Okay. You want any peppers
or chicken in there?"

365
00:18:49,054 --> 00:18:50,522
"No, I think she's
been through enough.

366
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,008
I'll just have the... [laughs]"

367
00:18:55,686 --> 00:18:57,863
I feel like they could bring
fajitas out from the kitchen

368
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:00,557
a little bit later.

369
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:05,662
There's a lot of showboating
going on with fajitas.

370
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:07,539
Seems unnecessary,

371
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:09,959
a fire emergency coming
through the dining room.

372
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:11,835
"Ah, it's fajitas,
they just need attention.

373
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:13,963
Fuck 'em."

374
00:19:13,997 --> 00:19:15,714
I was eating some fajitas

375
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:17,883
and I burnt the roof
of my mouth.

376
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:21,052
And I was like, "Ow! The roof
of my mouth, that hurts.

377
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:24,347
It's really tender. Wait
a minute. The roof of my mouth?

378
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:27,434
This is the ceiling of my mouth.

379
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:30,837
The roof of my mouth
is way up here.

380
00:19:33,057 --> 00:19:34,900
Whoever named this was not using

381
00:19:34,934 --> 00:19:37,319
the attic of their mouth
at all."

382
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:40,739
[laughter, applause]

383
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:43,141
Thanks.

384
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,870
I love applause
for head architecture.

385
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:49,790
This is a good crowd.

386
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,917
I took Super Shuttle
from the airport.

387
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:54,461
I think they forgot to put
the word "slow" in the middle

388
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:58,448
- of their name.
- [scattered applause]

389
00:19:59,792 --> 00:20:01,635
Hey, if I'm eating
some Tic Tacs,

390
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,929
and you want some,
I'm happy to give you some.

391
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:06,598
Just don't give me
a specific number.

392
00:20:06,632 --> 00:20:10,101
It's too stressful.
You know?

393
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:14,256
You want two?
Okay, one... 11. Fuck.

394
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,152
No, I don't want those back.
Just...

395
00:20:19,186 --> 00:20:23,223
They're in your palm,
just keep them. Okay? Thank you.

396
00:20:24,984 --> 00:20:27,870
When I was in high school,
I took karate.

397
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:30,831
One time I lost my temper
in class.

398
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:32,457
That's when I learned that
there's a difference

399
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:36,069
between taking karate
and receiving karate.

400
00:20:39,665 --> 00:20:42,909
I received the shit
out of that karate.

401
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:48,098
I like when people use
the term "color scheme."

402
00:20:48,132 --> 00:20:51,852
'Cause it sounds so sneaky.

403
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,854
"Okay, we're gonna
make this room look great,

404
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:56,214
and here's how
we're gonna do it.

405
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,527
Blue. Beige. Green.

406
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,904
Sh! Somebody's coming.
Don't talk about colors.

407
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:04,531
Hey, how you doing?
What's up?"

408
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:07,242
[chuckles]

409
00:21:07,276 --> 00:21:10,537
Sometimes the opposite
of something bad is also bad.

410
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:14,083
It's confusing.
Like pickpocketing. That's bad.

411
00:21:14,117 --> 00:21:16,752
But I found that putting thing
in people's pockets

412
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:19,154
is also bad.

413
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,633
So pickpocketing
and its opposite, put-pocketing,

414
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,077
are both bad.

415
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,039
Logic is tricky.

416
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,061
When we talk to babies,
sometimes we use baby talk.

417
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:36,479
I guess to relate to the baby,

418
00:21:36,513 --> 00:21:38,899
we try to sound more
like a baby.

419
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:42,111
You know, we'll be like,
"Hello, goo-goo, boopie."

420
00:21:42,145 --> 00:21:44,154
We should do that
with old people too.

421
00:21:44,188 --> 00:21:47,657
"Oh, hello, Grandpa.

422
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:51,478
Come here, you tired?
Oh, hello. Yes, oh. Hello."

423
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:57,667
If I live long enough,
that joke is gonna haunt me.

424
00:21:57,701 --> 00:22:01,296
[laughter, applause]

425
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,741
We should do that with teenagers
too. "What's up, asshole?"

426
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:07,719
"What are you doing?"
"I'm talking teen. Teen talk.

427
00:22:07,753 --> 00:22:09,538
Don't worry about it."

428
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,060
I parked my car in
a grocery store parking lot.

429
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:18,105
I got out of my car, and I
was walking towards the store

430
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:20,231
and this guy stopped me, goes,
"Hey, Demetri."

431
00:22:20,265 --> 00:22:22,484
I said, "Yeah?" He said,
"Hey, um,

432
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:24,736
could I be in one
of your jokes?"

433
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,989
I said, "Uh, sure.
How about this one?"

434
00:22:27,023 --> 00:22:30,826
[laughter]

435
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,997
He was like, "Okay.
What does it entail?"

436
00:22:35,031 --> 00:22:36,498
I was like,
"That's pretty much it.

437
00:22:36,532 --> 00:22:38,125
That's the joke."

438
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,585
He was like, "Then no.
I'm cool. No thanks.

439
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,587
I don't think I wanna
be in that joke."

440
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:45,281
I was like, "Too late.
I just told it."

441
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,927
He's like, "Seriously?"
I'm like, "Yeah. You're in it."

442
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:52,639
He was like, "Shit."

443
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:54,141
He walked away,
he was pissed off.

444
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:56,476
I was like, "You know,
fictional people

445
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,337
can be so moody,
it's ridiculous."

446
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:04,234
It's interesting that we say
"a head of lettuce"

447
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,111
but not a "dick of cucumber."

448
00:23:06,145 --> 00:23:09,723
[laughter, applause]

449
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,244
"Yeah, give me, uh...
give me a dick of cucumber.

450
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:16,621
That'd be great.
You know what?

451
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:20,125
Two tits of cantaloupe.
Throw those in the bag too.

452
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,044
Are kiwis in season? They are.
Okay.

453
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:24,046
Three testicles of kiwi
and I think we're good.

454
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,674
Good.

455
00:23:27,708 --> 00:23:30,510
And a rectum of fig.
That sounds delicious."

456
00:23:30,544 --> 00:23:34,139
[laughs]

457
00:23:34,173 --> 00:23:36,933
I'd say based on their behavior,
cherry tomatoes are not

458
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:40,229
interested in participating
in the salad.

459
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:41,980
Kind of like, "Whoa! Nice try.
I don't think so.

460
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:44,173
Watch out. Whoa! Whoa!"

461
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,404
How evasive are you gonna be?

462
00:23:49,438 --> 00:23:51,740
It's like I'm trying to stab
a rubber ball in this salad.

463
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:54,743
This is ridiculous.

464
00:23:54,777 --> 00:23:56,703
It's just too much work.
Then I get to the bottom

465
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,872
of the salad and it's just like

466
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:01,083
a bowl
of defiant small tomatoes

467
00:24:01,117 --> 00:24:04,086
that are like...
"We're no longer a salad.

468
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,756
We're tomatoes. Now what?"

469
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:10,217
Well, then I'll just eat you
with my hand.

470
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,635
Then I bite it,
so much drama.

471
00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:15,580
It's like... pssh! Blood! Ahh!

472
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:21,270
Salad is just too much work.
You know?

473
00:24:21,304 --> 00:24:24,022
You gotta get the ingredients,
wash everything,

474
00:24:24,056 --> 00:24:26,900
dry everything,
mix it together, dress it.

475
00:24:26,934 --> 00:24:29,069
Then I go to eat the salad,

476
00:24:29,103 --> 00:24:34,283
now I have to make a small copy
of the salad on my fork.

477
00:24:34,317 --> 00:24:36,743
For every bite. I have to be
like, "Okay. Lettuce,

478
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:39,204
onion, cherry tomato, cherry...
Forget it.

479
00:24:39,238 --> 00:24:43,208
Mushroom, pepper.

480
00:24:43,242 --> 00:24:44,960
Gotta make another
small salad. Here we go.

481
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:48,046
Lettuce..."

482
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,673
"How's your salad?"
"It's 17 small salads

483
00:24:50,707 --> 00:24:52,926
that I had to make."

484
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,137
That's probably why in a
restaurant the waiter's like,

485
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:56,638
"Are you still working
on that salad?"

486
00:24:56,672 --> 00:24:59,849
"You're goddamn right
I'm working.

487
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:02,293
I'm exhausted.
Take this thing away from me."

488
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,733
I think if a recipe
is unhealthy for you,

489
00:25:08,767 --> 00:25:10,735
they should change their tone

490
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:13,155
in how they describe the steps.

491
00:25:13,189 --> 00:25:14,364
I feel like the tone
never changes.

492
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:16,116
It's just like a sociopath

493
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,784
telling you what to do,
and they don't care

494
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:19,452
if it's like quinoa
or cheesecake.

495
00:25:19,486 --> 00:25:21,496
They're just like,
"Just do this, I don't care."

496
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:24,791
But if it's unhealthy, if it's
like cinnamon sticky buns,

497
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:28,403
"Step one: run seven miles.

498
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:35,885
Step six: before combining
brown sugar and caramel in bowl,

499
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,663
take off all of your clothes and
stand in front of the mirror.

500
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:44,186
You sure you wanna do this?

501
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,397
[sighs] All right.

502
00:25:47,431 --> 00:25:50,900
Step 14: contact your doctor,
you have diabetes."

503
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:54,262
[laughs]

504
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,199
I can't believe people
can still die

505
00:25:57,233 --> 00:25:59,826
from complications
in today's day and age.

506
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,704
That that counts
as a valid medical reason.

507
00:26:02,738 --> 00:26:06,416
I mean, how's that
even acceptable?

508
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:08,877
"So what happened exactly?"

509
00:26:08,911 --> 00:26:11,713
"Well, we got him into the OR,
and, uh, we opened him up,

510
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:14,507
and, uh, it was complicated.
You know?

511
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:18,220
It's, uh... it's a lot of blood
in there, all over the place,

512
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:20,889
and the organs are pretty
tightly packed.

513
00:26:20,923 --> 00:26:23,808
Brenda didn't have a good lunch,
my phone went off twice,

514
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:26,728
it's just...
it was complicated. He's dead.

515
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:28,630
Okay? Forget about it."

516
00:26:31,434 --> 00:26:33,443
If you get cremated,
is it all or nothing?

517
00:26:33,477 --> 00:26:36,196
Can you make requests?
I wonder if you can be, like,

518
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,073
half or something.
Like, "What does he want?

519
00:26:38,107 --> 00:26:39,199
Okay, says he wants
to be cremated

520
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:40,950
from the waist down. Okay?"

521
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:42,911
"Anything else?"
"Yeah, open casket.

522
00:26:42,945 --> 00:26:44,829
He wants his torso
at the one end,

523
00:26:44,863 --> 00:26:47,999
then the ashes,
and they lead to a lamp,

524
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:50,419
and, uh, he's dressed
as a genie."

525
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:55,298
[laughter, applause]

526
00:26:55,332 --> 00:26:56,966
"Well, good for him.
He's having some fun with it.

527
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,368
I think that's cool."

528
00:27:00,879 --> 00:27:02,931
I was thinking maybe
I'd get cremated.

529
00:27:02,965 --> 00:27:04,891
But instead of having him put me
into an urn,

530
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:09,187
I'd have him put me
into, like, an hourglass.

531
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:12,941
Then I could still participate,
you know what I mean?

532
00:27:12,975 --> 00:27:15,110
It'd be like my grandkids could
be playing a board game,

533
00:27:15,144 --> 00:27:17,070
they'd be like, "That's my
grandfather on the mantel there.

534
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:19,530
Grab that. Yes.
He's like six minutes.

535
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:22,684
Flip him over. Bonus round,
Scattergories. Here we go."

536
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:30,417
Jokes that end in death
don't usually end happy.

537
00:27:30,451 --> 00:27:32,752
Kind of like life.

538
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:36,965
- [laughs]
- [audience laughs]

539
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:38,841
I might just stick
to the prepared material

540
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:41,369
for the rest of the set.

541
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:44,431
I thought... I thought I could
freestyle a little bit,

542
00:27:44,465 --> 00:27:47,458
but the insides came out
a little too much there.

543
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:51,963
"How was the show?"
"I'm sad."

544
00:27:56,393 --> 00:27:58,528
When they say someone is gone
but not forgotten,

545
00:27:58,562 --> 00:28:01,239
it's such a nice sentiment.
You know what I mean?

546
00:28:01,273 --> 00:28:06,061
Forgotten but not gone...
that just sucks.

547
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:10,123
"Did he die?"
"Who are we even talking about?

548
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:13,168
I don't remember."

549
00:28:13,202 --> 00:28:15,378
Oh, that sucks.

550
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:17,213
When something goes wrong,

551
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:19,341
people send you their thoughts
and prayers.

552
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:22,010
And, uh, it's a nice idea,
but it's kind of weird.

553
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:23,470
You know what I mean? I
understand sending the prayers,

554
00:28:23,504 --> 00:28:27,432
but the thoughts...
that's kind of strange.

555
00:28:27,466 --> 00:28:29,642
"What do you got there?"
"Demetri sent us his thoughts

556
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:31,686
and prayers."
"How do they look?"

557
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,798
"Uh, the prayers look
appropriate. Um...

558
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:39,319
The thoughts are kind of weird.
He's...

559
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,112
...thinking of clipping
his toenails tonight

560
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,365
before he goes to bed.

561
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:45,825
I don't know why we need to know
that. We're grieving here.

562
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:48,103
But thanks."

563
00:28:50,364 --> 00:28:52,874
I was walking on the beach
in California,

564
00:28:52,908 --> 00:28:55,251
and a volleyball rolled up
by my feet.

565
00:28:55,285 --> 00:28:57,920
And this guy yelled,
"Little help!"

566
00:28:57,954 --> 00:29:01,032
So I just kicked it
a little bit towards him.

567
00:29:05,128 --> 00:29:06,971
I like watching volleyball.

568
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:08,014
I think it's a good sport
to watch.

569
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:09,182
'Cause most sports

570
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,266
it looks like all the players

571
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,310
really want the ball.

572
00:29:12,344 --> 00:29:14,645
But volleyball is different.

573
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,023
That looks like nobody
wants that thing.

574
00:29:17,057 --> 00:29:18,691
Like, "Okay, we don't want this.
You guys take it.

575
00:29:18,725 --> 00:29:21,152
Here you go." Each player's
like, "I don't want it.

576
00:29:21,186 --> 00:29:24,180
You take it.
I don't fucking want it!"

577
00:29:27,484 --> 00:29:30,686
"Let's try this again.
We don't want this."

578
00:29:33,323 --> 00:29:35,584
It looks like a game
for people

579
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:37,668
who don't like volleyballs.

580
00:29:37,702 --> 00:29:40,713
Football, on the other hand,
that looks like

581
00:29:40,747 --> 00:29:43,716
everybody wants that thing
so badly. Know what I mean?

582
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,009
All the players are like,
"Give me the ball.

583
00:29:45,043 --> 00:29:46,177
I'll catch it, I won't drop it.

584
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:47,262
I'll covet it, I'll protect it,

585
00:29:47,296 --> 00:29:48,471
it's mine," you know?

586
00:29:48,505 --> 00:29:49,472
They should make the football

587
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:50,973
look like something

588
00:29:51,007 --> 00:29:52,308
that you would protect

589
00:29:52,342 --> 00:29:54,269
and covet and hold.

590
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:57,939
A baby. A football should look
like a baby.

591
00:29:57,973 --> 00:29:59,357
Imagine if they were shaped
like babies.

592
00:29:59,391 --> 00:30:00,733
Those guys would
look like such heroes,

593
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,027
like throwing and catching
the baby

594
00:30:03,061 --> 00:30:05,530
and protecting it, you know?

595
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:07,407
Until they get to the extra
point, then it looks like,

596
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:11,077
"I'm sick of this
freaking baby." [thudding sound]

597
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:13,037
- [chuckles]
- [applause]

598
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:14,372
Baby just goes
through the uprights.

599
00:30:14,406 --> 00:30:17,750
"It's okay." [laughs]

600
00:30:17,784 --> 00:30:20,503
Indoor sports don't look
as cool as outdoor sports.

601
00:30:20,537 --> 00:30:23,214
Pool looks pretty cool.
But I've seen that in movies

602
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:25,300
where the guy's like... boof!
And the lady walks in,

603
00:30:25,334 --> 00:30:27,343
he's just kind of
looking smooth.

604
00:30:27,377 --> 00:30:31,139
But I don't even know what's the
second coolest indoor sport.

605
00:30:31,173 --> 00:30:34,476
It's like a distant second.
Maybe darts?

606
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,628
She walks in the bar
and you're like... [laughs]

607
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:43,551
Air hockey?

608
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:49,991
Foosball.
That's the worst.

609
00:30:50,025 --> 00:30:52,060
You don't wanna do foosball.

610
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:58,066
Are sheep pubes
also wool?

611
00:31:01,203 --> 00:31:02,795
How much of my turtleneck
is pubes?

612
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,907
I don't know if I want
to wear that thing anymore.

613
00:31:07,792 --> 00:31:10,828
Pubes on my neck.
I don't like that.

614
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:14,641
You can say
"Mind your own business,"

615
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:17,393
or you can say
"Mind your own beeswax."

616
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:19,187
I think that's the only time
you can really substitute

617
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:22,357
"beeswax" for "business."

618
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:26,528
"Is your trip beeswax
or pleasure, sir?"

619
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:30,532
"It's, uh,
it's a beeswax trip, actually.

620
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:35,786
[laughs] It's personal beeswax.
I'd rather not talk about it."

621
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,996
"What are you doing
after college?"

622
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,456
"Um, applied to beeswax school.

623
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,082
So we'll see what happens.

624
00:31:40,116 --> 00:31:42,277
My dad's
a small beeswax owner."

625
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:47,131
I like the word "nope"
because it's really specific.

626
00:31:47,165 --> 00:31:48,299
That's for when you
wanna say "no,"

627
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:51,344
but you're also happy about it.

628
00:31:51,378 --> 00:31:54,663
"Are you guys still
serving breakfast?" "Nope."

629
00:31:57,175 --> 00:32:00,669
'Cause you never hear
"Unfortunately, nope."

630
00:32:03,014 --> 00:32:05,758
"Nope" is for dicks.

631
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:09,445
Sometimes when I have to fart,
I feel like my stomach

632
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:13,408
is like a pushy attorney
and my butt is like a judge.

633
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:16,369
They're going back and forth
having this furious debate,

634
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:18,371
just back and forth,
more and more heated,

635
00:32:18,405 --> 00:32:21,332
and eventually my butt is like,
"I'll allow it."

636
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:25,961
[laughter, applause]

637
00:32:25,995 --> 00:32:29,215
"Sustained.

638
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:31,951
This better be silent,
counselor."

639
00:32:36,214 --> 00:32:37,557
It's so frustrating.
I don't know why,

640
00:32:37,591 --> 00:32:39,768
but I think
of so many fart jokes.

641
00:32:39,802 --> 00:32:41,728
I'll sit down to write some
jokes, we go for a walk,

642
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:44,397
fart jokes just float
into my head.

643
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:47,650
I'm prolific with fart jokes.

644
00:32:47,684 --> 00:32:49,819
But it's frustrating
because I can't tell them all,

645
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:52,405
because it's a bad style
to have as a comedian.

646
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,656
You know what I mean?
You don't wanna be the guy

647
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,283
who tells a lot of fart jokes.

648
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:57,326
So I end up having
to hold them in.

649
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,204
I actually have to hold in...

650
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:02,248
...jokes about farts, even.

651
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:04,626
And it hurts.

652
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,630
Then I get home, and I just
tell one giant fart joke...

653
00:33:08,664 --> 00:33:11,299
[laughs] ...to my place
when I'm alone,

654
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:14,076
and that's terrible.

655
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:17,806
I don't know a lot about
the laws of the universe,

656
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,808
but I will say this,
just on the topic.

657
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:21,768
If you're a man
and you're alone somewhere,

658
00:33:21,802 --> 00:33:25,980
and you fart,
a woman will appear.

659
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:28,566
Just bam! Just like that.
It's like they know

660
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,318
and they just send one.
"He just farted. Get over there.

661
00:33:30,352 --> 00:33:31,402
You're attractive? Even better.
Go, go, go.

662
00:33:31,436 --> 00:33:32,779
Stand next to him!

663
00:33:32,813 --> 00:33:36,391
Embarrass that dude!" [laughs]

664
00:33:39,611 --> 00:33:41,871
My friend said,
"I'm way better with faces

665
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,748
than I am with names."

666
00:33:43,782 --> 00:33:46,751
It's like, yeah, me too.
Everybody is.

667
00:33:46,785 --> 00:33:51,005
If I see somebody, I'm like,
"That's his face, right there.

668
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,968
The fleshy part on the front.
That's his face. Yeah."

669
00:33:56,002 --> 00:33:59,180
I heard somebody say,
"He's like a brother to me."

670
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:02,433
I said, "Oh, I'm so sorry.

671
00:34:02,467 --> 00:34:04,894
So he stole a bunch of money
from your mom and he tries

672
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:08,047
to fight you whenever you
go back to New Jersey?

673
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,861
I can relate." [laughs]

674
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:17,824
- Too real, guys, too real.
- [laughter]

675
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:20,535
I was in a jewelry store
and they had this necklace,

676
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:22,745
it was like cursive writing
in gold.

677
00:34:22,779 --> 00:34:25,707
And it said "Diane."
And I went up the saleswoman

678
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:28,250
and I said, "You know, if you
had one that said 'Not Diane, '

679
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,945
I think you'd have
a bigger market."

680
00:34:34,917 --> 00:34:36,885
And then I heard somebody go,
"Oh, that's a good point."

681
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:39,261
I turned and it was the guy
from the parking lot

682
00:34:39,295 --> 00:34:41,848
at the grocery store.

683
00:34:41,882 --> 00:34:45,434
- [applause, laughter]
- Just like...

684
00:34:45,468 --> 00:34:48,062
What are you doing here?

685
00:34:48,096 --> 00:34:51,273
He said, "I just wanted to stop
into another mediocre joke."

686
00:34:51,307 --> 00:34:54,402
[laughs]

687
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:56,863
People say "shotgun"
when they want the front seat.

688
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:58,656
You should say "shotgun"
when you're eating rice

689
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,575
and you have to sneeze.

690
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:04,520
[laughter, applause]

691
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:08,416
'Cause there's that moment
where there's no turning back,

692
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,710
where you're just like,
"Snowstorm's about to come out

693
00:35:10,744 --> 00:35:12,628
of my face, I don't know
how else to tell you this.

694
00:35:12,662 --> 00:35:15,156
Just watch out."

695
00:35:17,626 --> 00:35:19,468
I've heard people talk
about their private parts.

696
00:35:19,502 --> 00:35:23,055
I'd like to hear someone
talk about their public parts.

697
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,224
"You okay?" "Yeah, yeah, I just
hurt my publics on that door.

698
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,476
I'm fine."

699
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:30,921
"Your publics?" "My hands, man,
my publics. You see?"

700
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,527
Sometimes I'll be
in an awkward situation,

701
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,696
and I'll try to save it
really quickly

702
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,575
by saying something fast, but
often it just makes it worse.

703
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:43,826
I was at a party
and this woman said,

704
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,536
"Excuse me, your fly is open."

705
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,622
I said, "For business."

706
00:35:47,656 --> 00:35:50,666
And... "I mean, thank you.

707
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,444
Sorry, excuse me."

708
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,504
If you're on the phone
with somebody

709
00:35:55,538 --> 00:35:56,714
and they're looking up

710
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:58,257
some information for you,

711
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,341
I don't know why,
but they often

712
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:01,594
make a soft laser sound

713
00:36:01,628 --> 00:36:03,429
while you're waiting.
You know what I mean?

714
00:36:03,463 --> 00:36:05,097
They'll be like, "Okay,
sir, let me just look up

715
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:09,435
your account number.
[softly] Too-too-too-too...

716
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:12,396
Too-too-too-too...
Too-too..."

717
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,690
What the hell was that?

718
00:36:14,724 --> 00:36:17,902
Totally acceptable.
Only if it's a soft laser.

719
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:19,862
It can't be like, "Okay, sir,
just one minute.

720
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:26,577
[makes loud laser sound effects
and explosions]

721
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:31,273
There it is. 628...
Bum-bum-bum-bum..."

722
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:35,628
When they came out with
the Phillips head screwdriver,

723
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,463
I wonder if the guy who did
the flathead was like,

724
00:36:37,497 --> 00:36:40,341
"What?

725
00:36:40,375 --> 00:36:43,411
We can get credit for this?
Shit!"

726
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:50,935
If I see a scary movie
and then I come home,

727
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:53,688
and there's a noise in my house,
it sounds scary.

728
00:36:53,722 --> 00:36:55,523
I've seen a lot of funny movies,
I wish it would work

729
00:36:55,557 --> 00:36:57,900
the same way.

730
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:59,986
Like, "Did you hear that
in the kitchen?" "Yeah.

731
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,032
That was fucking hilarious."

732
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:08,995
"There is somebody hilarious
in this house." [laughs]

733
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:13,041
"I hope they bump
into some more stuff."

734
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:15,793
I don't like the way they write
on food packaging.

735
00:37:15,827 --> 00:37:20,006
I think it's condescending.
Because they use euphemisms

736
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,924
where they really shouldn't.
You know? Like,

737
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:25,594
it'll say
"best before April 3rd."

738
00:37:25,628 --> 00:37:28,056
Best before?

739
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:31,934
Is this the time
to be discussing excellence?

740
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:36,438
How about
"dangerous starting on"?

741
00:37:36,472 --> 00:37:39,425
"Diarrhea at."

742
00:37:42,729 --> 00:37:45,197
Food is tricky.
Like, milk starts out good,

743
00:37:45,231 --> 00:37:48,283
then it becomes bad.
Then it becomes disgusting.

744
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:52,313
Then it becomes dangerous.
Then it becomes cheese.

745
00:37:53,907 --> 00:37:56,417
Way to turn it around, milk!

746
00:37:56,451 --> 00:38:00,154
[applause, laughter]

747
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:03,507
Who figured that out?

748
00:38:03,541 --> 00:38:05,051
"Man, your place
smells terrible.

749
00:38:05,085 --> 00:38:06,802
You gotta get rid of this crap."
"Hold on.

750
00:38:06,836 --> 00:38:09,013
I just... wait.

751
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:11,599
I wanna see where this is going.
This vomit-shit smell

752
00:38:11,633 --> 00:38:13,059
might turn into the thing
I wanna melt

753
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:16,044
over everything I eat.
So just wait."

754
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:23,986
If I were inventing foods,
I would have never come up

755
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,155
with the hot dog.

756
00:38:26,189 --> 00:38:29,158
That is a very counterintuitive
food design.

757
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:31,201
"Okay, what do you got?"
"All right. Uh, we start

758
00:38:31,235 --> 00:38:33,704
with the intestine of a dead
animal. We take all the meat

759
00:38:33,738 --> 00:38:35,497
byproduct you were gonna
throw away, grind it up,

760
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:37,666
shove it into the intestine."

761
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,361
"I'm listening.

762
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:44,031
What does it look like?"
"A severed penis."

763
00:38:46,126 --> 00:38:48,719
"How is it served?"
"On a bun that looks like

764
00:38:48,753 --> 00:38:50,471
partially spread apart
ass cheeks. What do you say?"

765
00:38:50,505 --> 00:38:55,726
[laughter, applause]

766
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,588
"You're calling it dog.
Hm, very appealing."

767
00:39:00,598 --> 00:39:03,342
"It'll work in America."

768
00:39:08,064 --> 00:39:10,950
When I was in grade school,
they had the alphabet

769
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:12,994
on the wall above
the chalkboard,

770
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:15,287
kind of going around
the corner,

771
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:17,165
and it was interesting
'cause you could see

772
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,750
the uppercase and lowercase
letter for each letter.

773
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:22,252
It looked like a parent
and child from each family.

774
00:39:22,286 --> 00:39:23,712
You know what I mean?
And with some of them,

775
00:39:23,746 --> 00:39:26,174
you could really see
the resemblance.

776
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,968
Like with "X" I was like,
"That's definitely your parent.

777
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:32,096
I mean, I can see you're like
a carbon copy.

778
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,558
'C', I totally get it.
'Z, ' 'S, ' I mean... identical."

779
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:39,645
Others, like, harder
to really see, you know?

780
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,273
Like "A", like is that...
I don't know.

781
00:39:43,307 --> 00:39:45,067
I don't really see
the resemblance.

782
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:46,861
Looks like an "O" with like
a crutch or something.

783
00:39:46,895 --> 00:39:49,071
But okay.

784
00:39:49,105 --> 00:39:52,282
"R"... did you smoke while you
were pregnant or something?

785
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:55,953
'Cause... that kid
looks unfinished.

786
00:39:55,987 --> 00:39:59,248
That's kind of a weird-looking
child you have there.

787
00:39:59,282 --> 00:40:03,485
And "Q", did "P" and "G"...

788
00:40:04,829 --> 00:40:06,588
...kind of have an affair
or something?

789
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:07,923
And then they were
like, "Oh, what are we gonna do

790
00:40:07,957 --> 00:40:09,633
with this kid?"
And "Q" was like,

791
00:40:09,667 --> 00:40:11,135
"I hardly get used.
I could adopt it

792
00:40:11,169 --> 00:40:14,722
and look after it, just...

793
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:18,934
We'll call it a 'Q'.
Don't worry about it."

794
00:40:18,968 --> 00:40:21,229
If you're in a restaurant
and you wanna get the check,

795
00:40:21,263 --> 00:40:23,898
you just go like that
and they bring you the check.

796
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:25,733
I think you should be able
to do that at your job too.

797
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:27,943
You know?

798
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,945
If your boss walks by, you be
like, "Can I get the check?

799
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:32,990
Can I... I need the check now.
Yeah, for the...

800
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,601
Thank you, yeah."

801
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,954
The only time it's okay
to throw a hamster

802
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:41,857
is if it's out of the window
of a burning building.

803
00:40:43,701 --> 00:40:46,236
Then you're a hero.
You're like, "Live!

804
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,299
[sighs] That felt great.

805
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,134
It's the perfect size
and weight. I've always wanted

806
00:40:52,168 --> 00:40:54,620
to flick one of those."

807
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:58,266
My smoke alarm is so annoying.

808
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,226
I hate that
that's how safety works,

809
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,478
is that they're gonna
annoy me into being safe.

810
00:41:03,512 --> 00:41:07,149
I wanna put, like, microwave
popcorn around my house.

811
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:08,317
If I wake up in the middle
of the night, I'm like,

812
00:41:08,351 --> 00:41:09,985
"That smells great.

813
00:41:10,019 --> 00:41:13,864
I gotta get the fuck
out of here.

814
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:19,494
Get a snack on the way.
That's a good idea."

815
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:22,998
When you're trying to tell
somebody a letter on the phone,

816
00:41:23,032 --> 00:41:25,960
you'll be like, "B as in boy.
M as in Mary."

817
00:41:25,994 --> 00:41:27,878
That's what people do. They
always pick the first letter

818
00:41:27,912 --> 00:41:31,590
of the word.
You could mix it up.

819
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,451
"O as in tango.

820
00:41:36,712 --> 00:41:39,414
F as in deaf.

821
00:41:40,424 --> 00:41:45,062
R as in fart." [laughs]

822
00:41:45,096 --> 00:41:48,423
"Okay, sir, we get it."

823
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:51,986
I don't like fitted sheets.
I feel like

824
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,237
that's a very
passive-aggressive design

825
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:55,072
we're dealing with there.

826
00:41:55,106 --> 00:41:57,116
Does it have to be
the exact same size

827
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,784
as my mattress? Couldn't you
give me a little bit

828
00:41:58,818 --> 00:42:00,369
of wiggle room?

829
00:42:00,403 --> 00:42:02,163
I do my laundry and I'm already
in a bad mood

830
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:05,040
as I approach my mattress.

831
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:06,292
Do the first corner,
then the second.

832
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:07,376
By the time I get to the third,

833
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:08,336
I'm looking at the fourth like,

834
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,363
"You son of a bitch."

835
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,717
I get over there and it's just
such a struggle. I'm like,

836
00:42:15,751 --> 00:42:16,844
"I can't do it!
Come on, come on."

837
00:42:16,878 --> 00:42:18,053
My fingers are killing me.

838
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:19,138
I'm just pulling that thing down

839
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:20,264
the side as far as I can go.

840
00:42:20,298 --> 00:42:21,431
I get halfway down, I'm like,

841
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:23,351
"That's enough. It's fine."

842
00:42:23,385 --> 00:42:24,893
Four in the morning.
"Surprise, bitch!"

843
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:27,504
"Get off me! Get off me!

844
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:31,400
Fine, I'll use you
as a thin blanket.

845
00:42:31,434 --> 00:42:34,386
There you go. Now what?"

846
00:42:36,856 --> 00:42:38,866
I find that athletic clothes
are perfect

847
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,602
for just sitting around in.

848
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:48,458
[applause, cheering]

849
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:51,962
These are pajamas that make me
look ambitious. I like this.

850
00:42:51,996 --> 00:42:53,881
- [laughs]
- [whistling]

851
00:42:53,915 --> 00:42:56,758
I'm an athlete.
I'll even watch sports.

852
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:59,703
There we go. I'm so close.

853
00:43:01,214 --> 00:43:02,264
When I was in high school,
I couldn't decide

854
00:43:02,298 --> 00:43:03,473
whether I wanted to be

855
00:43:03,507 --> 00:43:04,975
on the debate team or not.

856
00:43:05,009 --> 00:43:07,377
And that was frustrating.

857
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:13,442
Happy birthday, by the way.

858
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:16,486
- [woman] I just turned 30!
- Hey, I used statistics.

859
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,949
- Happy birthday.
- [laughter, applause]

860
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:22,868
That's great.
Thanks for coming.

861
00:43:22,902 --> 00:43:25,996
You just turned 30.
That's cool. How's it going?

862
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,956
- [woman] Great.
- What are you doing?

863
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:30,834
Like life-wise? Job-wise?

864
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:33,737
I messed up that question.
I could just "What do you do?"

865
00:43:36,958 --> 00:43:40,969
- She left. Oh, shit.
- [laughter]

866
00:43:41,003 --> 00:43:44,289
She's like, "I'm 30, I don't
have to deal with this shit."

867
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:49,311
What's the minimum number
of people you can have

868
00:43:49,345 --> 00:43:53,523
and it still counts
as a surprise party? I wonder.

869
00:43:53,557 --> 00:43:55,484
It seems like it's gotta be
greater than one.

870
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:57,111
If you come home
and just one friend jumps out

871
00:43:57,145 --> 00:43:59,321
from behind your couch,
"Surprise!"

872
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:02,474
"Get the hell out of my house!"

873
00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:07,062
"It's a party."
"No, you're an intruder."

874
00:44:09,449 --> 00:44:11,625
If I robbed people's houses,
I would just bring

875
00:44:11,659 --> 00:44:14,795
a lot of people and a cake
just in case

876
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:17,298
the person came home.

877
00:44:17,332 --> 00:44:19,133
They walk in, you're like,
"Surprise!

878
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:20,550
Hey, we got you all your stuff.
We put it in bags.

879
00:44:20,584 --> 00:44:21,385
Okay, we're gonna go.
Enjoy the cake.

880
00:44:21,419 --> 00:44:24,221
Bye."

881
00:44:24,255 --> 00:44:26,974
I think what I like the most
about people

882
00:44:27,008 --> 00:44:29,184
who are very religious
is how open they are

883
00:44:29,218 --> 00:44:31,753
to other people's
points of view.

884
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:37,943
It's nice.

885
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:40,154
I like atheists
because you don't really

886
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:42,197
ever hear about, like,
an atheist, like,

887
00:44:42,231 --> 00:44:44,450
blowing up a school or,
you know,

888
00:44:44,484 --> 00:44:45,867
a restaurant or something.
They're never like,

889
00:44:45,901 --> 00:44:49,579
"Science!" [imitates explosion]

890
00:44:49,613 --> 00:44:52,774
"Logic!" [imitates machine gun]

891
00:44:57,663 --> 00:45:00,424
I heard this R&B song.
It came on the radio.

892
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:02,134
I was in a rental car.
I turned the radio on.

893
00:45:02,168 --> 00:45:04,136
This song comes on.
This guy's, like,

894
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,138
kind of telling a story,
he's kind of whining.

895
00:45:06,172 --> 00:45:08,098
But okay, I'm listening.
All of a sudden,

896
00:45:08,132 --> 00:45:11,477
in the middle of the song,
a rapper shows up.

897
00:45:11,511 --> 00:45:14,062
Guess these guys are friends
or something. He shows up,

898
00:45:14,096 --> 00:45:16,398
he does a whole rap
of just his own thing.

899
00:45:16,432 --> 00:45:19,276
Finishes up, he takes off.
We never hear from him again.

900
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:23,030
He's gone. First guy comes back
and he finishes the story,

901
00:45:23,064 --> 00:45:25,740
and then the song's over. I just
thought that was hilarious.

902
00:45:25,774 --> 00:45:28,369
'Cause I've never seen that
in any other art form.

903
00:45:28,403 --> 00:45:31,330
You know? Not like
in literature, you know,

904
00:45:31,364 --> 00:45:33,541
you're reading a book. "What'd
you think of that novel?"

905
00:45:33,575 --> 00:45:35,459
"Pretty good, you know, like,
I got into the story,

906
00:45:35,493 --> 00:45:37,127
first seven chapters.
Then in the middle,

907
00:45:37,161 --> 00:45:42,466
there was a really angry
first person essay...

908
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,510
This other writer, I guess.
I don't know if they're friends

909
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:47,596
or something, but... You know,
this guy has a big dick,

910
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,348
he's gonna sleep with all these
women, it's a whole thing.

911
00:45:49,382 --> 00:45:52,017
And... he's not gonna
by them stuff, though.

912
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:53,643
He made that clear.
He'll sleep with them,

913
00:45:53,677 --> 00:45:57,314
but he's not, you know,
not looking to get tied down.

914
00:45:57,348 --> 00:46:01,569
All caps. Very confident. Uh...

915
00:46:01,603 --> 00:46:03,737
A lot of it rhymed,
and then the essay was over.

916
00:46:03,771 --> 00:46:06,656
And then went back to the story.
Yeah, it was all right."

917
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:08,700
When I was a kid,
I could climb trees.

918
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:10,660
That was a thing I could do
that I can't do anymore.

919
00:46:10,694 --> 00:46:13,414
I lost that privilege. You know?

920
00:46:13,448 --> 00:46:17,000
If I go down a street and I see
a bunch of kids in trees,

921
00:46:17,034 --> 00:46:18,252
I'm like, oh,
they're having fun.

922
00:46:18,286 --> 00:46:20,003
If I go down the same street

923
00:46:20,037 --> 00:46:21,129
and there are adults in all
the trees,

924
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:22,464
I'm like, "I need to get

925
00:46:22,498 --> 00:46:25,300
into a fucking tree now."

926
00:46:25,334 --> 00:46:27,719
[applause]

927
00:46:27,753 --> 00:46:31,123
"Something bad is happening
on this street.

928
00:46:33,426 --> 00:46:37,938
There's like a wolf or something
around here."

929
00:46:37,972 --> 00:46:39,648
That's how you know you're
a grownup,

930
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:40,608
if someone sees you in a tree
and they're like,

931
00:46:40,642 --> 00:46:44,612
"Get help!"

932
00:46:44,646 --> 00:46:47,114
I don't know why, but if
somebody's smelling something,

933
00:46:47,148 --> 00:46:49,450
and they also close their eyes
while they're doing it,

934
00:46:49,484 --> 00:46:52,186
I just wanna smack them
in the face.

935
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:55,372
"Open your eyes.
You can do both.

936
00:46:55,406 --> 00:46:56,498
You can look and smell
at the same time.

937
00:46:56,532 --> 00:46:58,233
Don't do that."

938
00:47:01,162 --> 00:47:03,046
Sometimes they have a bottle

939
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,048
and they'll have
a little ship inside.

940
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:07,384
Looks cool. It's like the ship
in the bottle, you know?

941
00:47:07,418 --> 00:47:10,220
That would probably
be the worst thing

942
00:47:10,254 --> 00:47:14,666
to have float up to an island
that you're stranded on.

943
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:20,005
"This is no time for irony!"

944
00:47:23,601 --> 00:47:25,986
People only mention
that it's a free country

945
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,488
when they're
doing something shitty.

946
00:47:27,522 --> 00:47:31,074
[laughter, applause]

947
00:47:31,108 --> 00:47:34,411
- It's like...
- [cheering]

948
00:47:34,445 --> 00:47:37,706
"Hey, that's my seat."
"It's a free country."

949
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:40,208
[mutters] Motherfucker...

950
00:47:40,242 --> 00:47:42,085
People should mention it's
a free country when they're

951
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,338
doing something nice too. Hold
the door for a bunch of people

952
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:47,466
"Thank you, sir."
"It's a free country."

953
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,469
"Yes, it is, and you
are a patriot. Thank you."

954
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:54,473
- [cheering, whistling]
- Yeah.

955
00:47:54,507 --> 00:47:57,267
I wonder if you're in prison,
if the other inmates

956
00:47:57,301 --> 00:47:59,478
judge you based on
what you're in for.

957
00:47:59,512 --> 00:48:02,731
Like, when they're organizing
events or activities, you know.

958
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:04,274
Like, "Should we get Joey
on the committee?"

959
00:48:04,308 --> 00:48:06,234
"No, he's in
for attempted murder.

960
00:48:06,268 --> 00:48:08,320
I feel like he doesn't really
see things through."

961
00:48:08,354 --> 00:48:12,099
[laughter]

962
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:19,039
On your tombstone...
stay with me.

963
00:48:19,073 --> 00:48:21,416
[laughs]

964
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,960
On your tombstone,
they have the birthdate,

965
00:48:23,994 --> 00:48:25,920
and the death date.

966
00:48:25,954 --> 00:48:28,674
And in between, your whole life,
everything you experienced,

967
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:32,511
joys, triumphs, defeat,
love, heart break...

968
00:48:32,545 --> 00:48:35,764
Pshht!

969
00:48:35,798 --> 00:48:39,184
Your whole life is just
a little dash after all this.

970
00:48:39,218 --> 00:48:40,728
That's a bummer.
I'm not doing that.

971
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:42,145
I'm gonna have an ellipsis.

972
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:45,815
I'm gonna have three dots.

973
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:47,693
Somebody looks at my tombstone,
there'll be suspense.

974
00:48:47,727 --> 00:48:50,362
They'll be like, "He was born...
Then what?

975
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:53,640
Uh, he died. There it is.
Right there."

976
00:48:55,317 --> 00:48:57,160
- But then...
- [cheering]

977
00:48:57,194 --> 00:48:59,621
...three more dots,
and a third date.

978
00:48:59,655 --> 00:49:02,916
"Holy shit, this guy rallied!

979
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,904
Whoa! What an interesting
dead person."

980
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,177
I would never go
tandem skydiving.

981
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:18,081
If something goes wrong, you're
getting dry-humped to death.

982
00:49:20,175 --> 00:49:23,437
What a terrible way to go.

983
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:25,564
"What happened?"
"Uh, looks like he got

984
00:49:25,598 --> 00:49:29,217
dry-humped going about 200 miles
per hour into the earth."

985
00:49:32,438 --> 00:49:35,616
I got an email from someone
that said, at the bottom,

986
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:38,786
"Warmest regards, Steven."

987
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:41,288
That's when I realized that's
as warm as you can go

988
00:49:41,322 --> 00:49:43,815
with regards.

989
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:47,544
You know what I mean?
Like, "Hot regards, Steven."

990
00:49:47,578 --> 00:49:50,113
That's no appropriate, Steven.

991
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:53,634
"Steaming hot regards." What,
did you just take a shit

992
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:55,952
in my email?

993
00:49:59,757 --> 00:50:05,520
Warm or room temperature regards
will be just fine for me. Okay?

994
00:50:05,554 --> 00:50:07,648
Regards are strange, 'cause you
can only really send them.

995
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:09,691
It's very hard to give them
in person.

996
00:50:09,725 --> 00:50:11,443
You tell somebody, "Hey,
give him my regards."

997
00:50:11,477 --> 00:50:12,902
And they can kind of be
the middleman

998
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:15,363
and pass the regards along.

999
00:50:15,397 --> 00:50:16,824
You show up at a friend's house,
they open the door,

1000
00:50:16,858 --> 00:50:19,309
you're like, "Hey, regards."

1001
00:50:21,403 --> 00:50:22,830
"What the hell was that?"
"I'm regarding you."

1002
00:50:22,864 --> 00:50:23,872
"Don't do it, it's awkward.
I don't know

1003
00:50:23,906 --> 00:50:25,206
how to deal with this.

1004
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,625
Please send them through

1005
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:29,837
someone else in the future,
okay?"

1006
00:50:29,871 --> 00:50:33,256
I like buying shoes
because you go the store,

1007
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,591
and they have those
little mirrors,

1008
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:37,469
they have those
little slanted mirrors.

1009
00:50:37,503 --> 00:50:39,763
So funny, you know?
"How do those feel?"

1010
00:50:39,797 --> 00:50:41,807
"These feel good. I was just
wondering, do you have anything

1011
00:50:41,841 --> 00:50:45,168
that could show me what
they'll look like to dogs?"

1012
00:50:47,763 --> 00:50:49,773
"Uh, yes, we do. We have these
ridiculous small mirrors

1013
00:50:49,807 --> 00:50:51,859
all over the room, so...

1014
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:53,943
Yeah, these."
"Oh, those are perfect,

1015
00:50:53,977 --> 00:50:55,904
yeah, 'cause I don't want to be
involved in the reflection,

1016
00:50:55,938 --> 00:50:57,947
I don't want my identity
linked to the shoes at all.

1017
00:50:57,981 --> 00:51:00,784
I just want new shoes
and severed shins,

1018
00:51:00,818 --> 00:51:02,494
just floating around the room,
like,

1019
00:51:02,528 --> 00:51:04,454
as if I'm four-fifths ghost
or something

1020
00:51:04,488 --> 00:51:06,998
would be perfect for me."

1021
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:09,083
It's weird, 'cause, like,
when you buy gloves,

1022
00:51:09,117 --> 00:51:10,210
they don't have mirrors off
to the side where you're like,

1023
00:51:10,244 --> 00:51:11,837
"Oh, that's good. Just...

1024
00:51:11,871 --> 00:51:13,922
...the glove and my wrist.
That's all,

1025
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:17,509
the forearm and the glove
is all I really needed there."

1026
00:51:17,543 --> 00:51:21,847
I saw a TV commercial
for a TV.

1027
00:51:21,881 --> 00:51:24,182
The basis of the commercial
was, "Look at how amazing

1028
00:51:24,216 --> 00:51:27,602
the picture is on this TV."

1029
00:51:27,636 --> 00:51:29,563
I looked at it and I was like,
"That looks remarkably

1030
00:51:29,597 --> 00:51:34,735
identical to the resolution
of my TV.

1031
00:51:34,769 --> 00:51:37,304
I think I'm good, thanks."

1032
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:41,658
I like the term "sexual favor"
'cause it's

1033
00:51:41,692 --> 00:51:45,829
a really funny understatement.
You know?

1034
00:51:45,863 --> 00:51:47,288
"Anything else
I can do for you?"

1035
00:51:47,322 --> 00:51:50,375
"Uh, yeah. Just, um...

1036
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:52,986
...if I could ask a favor."

1037
00:51:54,288 --> 00:51:55,797
"What, you need a ride
or something?"

1038
00:51:55,831 --> 00:51:58,199
"Yeah, kind of."

1039
00:52:03,756 --> 00:52:07,935
All right, I wanna get
something offstage now.

1040
00:52:07,969 --> 00:52:11,271
But I don't want there to be,
like, a dead space

1041
00:52:11,305 --> 00:52:14,608
in the middle of this special,
so...

1042
00:52:14,642 --> 00:52:17,026
I wonder if I, um...

1043
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,947
if I use editing,
if I go from right here,

1044
00:52:19,981 --> 00:52:22,657
if I could suddenly appear
over there.

1045
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:25,535
Cool, that worked. All right.

1046
00:52:25,569 --> 00:52:28,121
[laughs]

1047
00:52:28,155 --> 00:52:32,250
- They can't see me right now.
- [plays harmonica]

1048
00:52:32,284 --> 00:52:35,487
[cheering]

1049
00:52:43,504 --> 00:52:47,499
[playing harmonica]

1050
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:54,606
[chuckles]

1051
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,775
- [strums chord]
- All right.

1052
00:52:56,809 --> 00:53:00,887
- Yeah, that was...
- [cheering]

1053
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:07,661
That was almost smooth.
It was so close. [laughs]

1054
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:11,623
[plays guitar melody]

1055
00:53:11,657 --> 00:53:15,126
I love playing guitar.
I find it so relaxing.

1056
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:17,587
I'm not great at it,
but, you know,

1057
00:53:17,621 --> 00:53:20,173
I still play
'cause I enjoy it.

1058
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:24,177
I've tried to write songs,
but it's not my gift.

1059
00:53:24,211 --> 00:53:28,623
I wrote a protest song, but it
was an instrumental, so...

1060
00:53:30,384 --> 00:53:33,044
So very ineffective.

1061
00:53:35,097 --> 00:53:37,524
My friend called my other friend
a night owl,

1062
00:53:37,558 --> 00:53:39,026
and I was like, "You know,
owls are nocturnal.

1063
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,777
You could probably just
call him an owl

1064
00:53:40,811 --> 00:53:42,637
and that would cover it."

1065
00:53:45,733 --> 00:53:48,368
I think it's cool that flash
mobs came and went so quickly

00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:17,939
If you can imagine a robot
that's so technically advanced

1074
00:54:17,973 --> 00:54:21,468
that it moves exactly
like a regular human being...

of the dance floor

I saw that it was Shark Week.

So sharks get a week every year.

I know we're afraid of both,

I think the best form

is correcting

1112

the only thing I would

"Nice try, asshole."

I feel like most people
are assholes

Sometimes instead of saying
"for example,"

I'll say something such as,
