1
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,482
What the fuck, Boston?

2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,108
Goddamn!

3
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,527
Thank you.

4
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,489
It's good to be here.
Good to be back.

5
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,116
Fuck!

6
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:35,993
I love it.

7
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,286
Goddamn it!

8
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,706
Good to see happy people...

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,541
having a good time.

10
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,878
It's a tense world we're living in today.

11
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:49,966
You got a president that's threatening
to fight an ex-vice president.

12
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,886
You pay attention to that shit?

13
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,055
It's a couple weeks ago on Twitter.

14
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,182
Donald Trump said that
if he fought Joe Biden,

15
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,392
Joe Biden would go down fast and hard.

16
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,914
I want to get in his ear. I'll be like,
"Let's make this happen, bro."

17
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,523
There's money on the table.

18
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,942
I'll commentate for free.

19
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,570
No rules, grow your nails out,
wear a diaper.

20
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,572
No clothes. To the death.

21
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,323
Fuck it.

22
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,786
Let's bring this thing totally down.

23
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,498
Seems like every day you turn on the news,
more and more crazy shit.

24
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,918
When are we going to realize
we shouldn't have a fucking president?

25
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:27,796
It's a ridiculous idea
to have a popularity contest

26
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,547
to see who controls everything.

27
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,800
Because if you could go back in time

28
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:35,428
and grab Thomas Jefferson
and bring him to 2018...

29
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,181
his first question would be...

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,975
"You guys didn't write any new shit?

31
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,776
Dude, I wrote that with a feather.

32
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,278
I did it by fire!

33
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,364
That's the only way I could see
what I was writing!

34
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,907
You lazy fucks!

35
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,452
You guys have phones in your pockets
and spaceships!

36
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,748
'But the wisdom of the scroll
shall not be adjusted.'

37
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,667
What the fuck does that even mean?

38
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,169
Who told you that, bro?"

39
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,925
We always like to say, "The long,
great history of the United States."

40
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,969
Listen, that's not real.

41
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,056
The United States was founded in 1776.

42
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,850
People live to be a hundred.

43
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,644
That's three people ago.

44
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,693
You're like, "Is he right?"

45
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,610
Yeah!

46
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,613
The Fear Factor guy just hit you
with a fucking math quiz!

47
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,658
Three people ago!

48
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,871
Listen to me, you're not going
to get this from teachers.

49
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:45,498
We used to be monkeys,
and we found mushrooms,

50
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,127
and now we're different.
And it's real, real recent.

51
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,921
No one knows what's going on.

52
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:56,050
Three people ago, slave owners
made boats out of trees,

53
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,179
and used the power of the wind
to drift across the ocean.

54
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,764
They didn't have a YouTube video
to watch first.

55
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,683
They didn't talk to a travel agent.

56
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,186
You know what they had?
A drawing.

57
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,855
Some guy went there and drew it.

58
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,899
Like, "Are you sure that's what you saw?"

59
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,610
"That's what I saw!
You callin' me a liar?"

60
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,112
And they had a gunfight
in the dirt streets.

61
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,990
They were fucking savages
just three people ago.

62
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,618
They took their baby
and jumped on a boat

63
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,329
and floated across the fucking ocean
with their kids.

64
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:26,246
Animals.

65
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,498
That's us.

66
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,211
It just happened.

67
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,631
Real recent!

68
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,176
"I just never saw Trump coming."

69
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,261
Well, you don't pay attention to trends.

70
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,555
We have a very clear trend
in this country.

71
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,557
We try one person as president,

72
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,101
and the next person has to be
completely opposite.

73
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,021
'Cause no one can do the job correctly.

74
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,649
So we let someone try it
and we're like, "He fucked it up."

75
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,235
We go with this guy
who's totally different,

76
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,111
who's got our interests in mind.

77
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,197
And we always do the same thing.

78
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,991
We go right, left, dumb, smart.
We give everybody a chance.

79
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,327
We go Clinton, Bush.

80
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,329
Then we go Bush, Obama.

81
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,789
Obama, Trump.

82
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,918
We just got out
of a long-term relationship

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,880
with a very boring but sensible person,

84
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,218
and now we're dating a whore.

85
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,888
All right?

86
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,309
She's got fake hair.

87
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,686
She's racist.

88
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,355
She's always lying.

89
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,607
We don't care!

90
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,277
We're not trying to start a family,

91
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,362
we just want to run red lights
and fuck.

92
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,447
All right?

93
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,076
For real. We don't know what we're doing.

94
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,080
If this country was a person, we'd be
on coke, driving a yellow Corvette,

95
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,001
singing Mötley Crüe songs
in front of our ex's house.

96
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,423
We're going crazy!

97
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,052
"Well, it would have been so much better
if Hillary won."

98
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,555
"We got so close!"

99
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,890
"We almost had a woman!"

100
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,145
Girls, relax.

101
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,857
I think a woman can be president.

102
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:21,112
But let's not use a lying old lady
who faints a lot.

103
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,116
I think you can do better.

104
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,345
It's not that I don't think a woman
can be president.

105
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,664
I'm fucking sure a woman can fuck it up
just as bad as the men that fucked it up.

106
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,624
No one's going to do it right.

107
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,795
But if Hillary Clinton was my own mom,
I'd be like, "Mom!

108
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:40,006
You can't be president.

109
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,050
You can't stand up fast."

110
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,803
"I'll show you!

111
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,806
One ring to rule them all..."

112
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,147
"You're sexist! I see, you're sexist!

113
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,690
As well as short.

114
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,984
You're fucking sexist!"

115
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,154
Defuse my point of view.

116
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:05,823
I am sexist.

117
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,618
But I'm sexist against men.

118
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,746
I decided during this whole
Harvey Weinstein thing.

119
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,997
This is why.

120
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,540
That's when I realized I was...

121
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,376
I had some suspicions...

122
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,711
that I might be sexist before that.

123
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,466
That's when I really decided.

124
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,260
'Cause what Harvey Weinstein did,
it was fucking terrible.

125
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,613
Can you imagine being an actress?

126
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,390
You gotta fuck that guy
in order to make it. Like.

127
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,644
What a horrible choice.
Like, what a terrible position to be in!

128
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,564
"This is the only way?" That sucks.
That's fucking... That's criminal.

129
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,984
I think that guy's a piece of shit.
I think he should be punished.

130
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,071
But!

131
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,533
If he had done the exact same thing
to men,

132
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,118
I wouldn't give a fuck.

133
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,457
I wouldn't even be slightly upset.

134
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,212
If I was reading the morning paper
and I read a story

135
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,632
about a bunch of dudes who let
Harvey Weinstein fuck 'em...

136
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,552
so they could be in superhero movies...

137
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,264
I'd read that, I'd go, "Ha-ha!"

138
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:13,891
What else?

139
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,811
What else is happening?

140
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,065
- I wouldn't be clamoring for justice.
- Woo!

141
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:27,780
If Harvey Weinstein was a woman
who looked like Harvey Weinstein...

142
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:33,744
and she did the exact same shit to men,
my only question would be, "Hey!

143
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,663
How bad you want to be Batman?

144
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,625
How long is it going to take, bro?

145
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,296
You could wait tables in this town
for 20 years and never catch a break.

146
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,215
Or you give the nice lady what she wants.

147
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,930
Jude Law is in the waiting room
and he's wearing a lobster bib.

148
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,141
You tell me...

149
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,809
if you want to be a winner.

150
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,314
They don't fucking give
Ferraris away, son!

151
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,232
They make 'em by hand."

152
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,490
If Harvey Weinstein propositioned
my daughter

153
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,035
and offered her a movie role
in exchange for sex,

154
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:18,080
I, like every other parent in this room,
would want to fuck him up.

155
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,878
But if Harvina Weinstein...

156
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,299
came to my son with a solid contract...

157
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,596
I'd be like,
"Dude, you're gonna be Batman.

158
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,141
Yes, you are.

159
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:45,149
Hey, no crying!
Batman doesn't cry! Come on!"

160
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,029
"Your own son? Really?"

161
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,614
Jaaaaa.

162
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,200
What's the worst thing that can happen?

163
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,663
It'd be a harder job.

164
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,165
It'd be hard to please Harvina.

165
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,750
Right?

166
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,104
Rich old lady, it's probably real hard
to make 'em come.

167
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:09,215
You gotta make eye contact,
you gotta lock in with them.

168
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,052
They got to know
you're involved in this project.

169
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,014
Right? Rich old ladies are probably
super skeptical.

170
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,730
Look. Always, always maintain eye contact.

171
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,346
That wouldn't be the hard part.

172
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,901
The hard part is,
when you go down on Harvina,

173
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,320
she likes to rest her fat gut
on your forehead.

174
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,657
And the sweat!
The sweat gets in your eyes!

175
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,577
And it stings like sunscreen!

176
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:42,623
But you gotta keep 'em open
'cause you want a Ferrari! Aah! Aah!

177
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,294
Nobody cares.

178
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,256
Nobody cares about boys
that have to eat pussy. No one cares.

179
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,719
We're all sexist against men.

180
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,722
No one cares. No one feels bad.

181
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,476
"How'd you get that car?"
"Man, I had to eat pussy for it."

182
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,728
"You gonna be okay?"

183
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,566
Feel bad for you.

184
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,824
Look, I get it. Men are gross, ladies.
I'm on your side.

185
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,369
My favorite example of the difference

186
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:23,914
between the way men and women are treated
was always old school Fox News.

187
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,793
I used to watch it without the sound on,

188
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,296
so it's almost like watching
a wildlife program,

189
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,506
just watch them move around.

190
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,259
I was watching it once
and Megyn Kelly was on,

191
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,763
and she was on with Bill O'Reilly.
They were right next to each other,

192
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,098
so I assumed they were
in the same climate.

193
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,603
But Bill O'Reilly was dressed
like there was a chill in the air.

194
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,482
He had a jacket on, a shirt,
a tie, and pants.

195
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,068
And Megyn Kelly was wearing

196
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,405
what would best be described
as a vagina curtain.

197
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,495
Not a good curtain either.

198
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:07,249
Not like one of those Vegas curtains
that lets you sleep in late. No, no, no.

199
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,878
No, this curtain is like that curtain
that sits over Grandma's kitchen sink.

200
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,630
You know that one?

201
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,508
Kind of flutters in the breeze.
You could always see the yard.

202
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,842
You know that one?

203
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,721
And Megyn Kelly's on TV
with smooth, slippery skin

204
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:24,141
that doesn't exist in nature
outside the dolphin community.

205
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,937
You'd see her toes.

206
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,064
You'd see her feet and her toes.

207
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,068
She could just kick off her shoes
and there's a Dorito-sized piece of cloth

208
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,696
keeping you from the greatest show
on earth.

209
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,905
And it's right there.

210
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,074
She knows it's right there,
you know it's right there

211
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,076
and no one's saying a fucking word.

212
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,788
And if she disagrees with you, she'll
adjust the curtain and switch her legs.

213
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,168
Nobody says nothing.

214
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,963
If I was talking to a dude...

215
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,298
and he didn't have any pants on...

216
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,553
and he kept switching his legs
back and forth...

217
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,640
I'd be like, "Hey, man.Are we cool?

218
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,105
Where the fuck
are the rest of your clothes?

219
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,024
Why you so itchy?
Where'd you get those shoes?"

220
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,026
No one says shit

221
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,114
while Megyn Kelly's over there trying
to start a fake tan fire in her pussy.

222
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,332
It's weird. I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with it, but it's weird.

223
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:33,502
She doesn't have any sleeves on.
Where are your sleeves?

224
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,716
That's not weird? It's not weird,

225
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,176
it's strange.

226
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,803
"I want you to respect me."

227
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,598
I want to respect you, but you're
half-naked and I want to fuck you,

228
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,934
so I'm confused. I don't know what to do.

229
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,104
I'm thinking of saying anything you want.

230
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,900
Whatever you want me to say, I'll say it.
I want you to like me more.

231
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,404
That's the problem with a woman
that's that beautiful and super smart.

232
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,490
You know she's smarter than you.
She's a lawyer.

233
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,992
She never says "um,"
she's smart as fuck.

234
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,956
And she's really, really, really pretty,
and she doesn't have a lot of clothes on.

235
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,668
She's gonna get her way. All right?

236
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,297
You won't tell her to go fuck herself.
You've to be super secure to do that.

237
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,468
And you can see some of her tit.

238
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,639
That's weird, right?

239
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,922
If I came here like this, you'd be like,
"Joe, what the fuck are you doing, man?"

240
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:35,231
Right, but if Megyn Kelly's on TV,
"She's just got a cute shirt on.

241
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,441
It's just cute. It's cute."

242
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,151
You could see some tit.

243
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,820
You could see some middle tit.

244
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,697
You might even see some side tit
if you catch...

245
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,741
if she's pointing at something,
she might just...

246
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:49,036
"I didn't even know you were looking at
my side tit." She'll just pretend.

247
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,374
But long as you don't show
the dirty, dirty dark skin.

248
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,545
There it is!

249
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,257
The sensitive, forbidden skin!
Put it away!

250
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,175
It's not for strangers!

251
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,346
That's fucking strange, ladies.

252
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,807
Listen, don't listen to me. I'm a moron.

253
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,561
Wear what you're wearing,
it looks great, but it's weird.

254
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,815
You can show some of a sex organ.

255
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,609
What if that was the case with dudes?

256
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,293
What if we had a window in our pants,
we could just see the shaft?

257
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,866
Right? Just the shaft.

258
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,411
You can't see the head of my dick,
I'm not a creep.

259
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,707
Okay? Just a little side dick.

260
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:40,754
You have cleavage, we have tubage,
it's no big deal. It's whatever.

261
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,967
Just showing a little tubage.
Why do I dress like that?

262
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,512
To look cute for my friends. Okay? God!

263
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,347
You're so fucking jealous.

264
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,184
I need to get a sip of water.
Excuse me for a moment here.

265
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,026
I probably should've taken this onstage
with me, but I'm trying to be cool.

266
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,905
That's that cotton mouth, son.

267
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,658
Woo!

268
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,494
Yeah, you guys are legal now.

269
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,039
I grew up here. We used to hide
in the bushes and smoke weed.

270
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,292
Ridiculous. Hiding from cops
that are now getting high.

271
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,795
Going, "What do I do to all those
fucking kids? Hoo-hoo-hoo."

272
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,216
The real problem is the laws.

273
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,177
And Massachusetts finally has good laws.

274
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,722
We'll be able to understand...

275
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,807
what pot actually is.

276
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,352
Florida's got the craziest laws,

277
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:38,979
'cause Florida's trying to protect
their pain pill industry.

278
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,565
So in Florida, they make it so illegal,

279
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,361
this is one of the things they do
in Florida: they hire undercover cops

280
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,613
to pretend to be high school students.

281
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,532
Specifically a hot woman.

282
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,202
They hired a 25-year-old hot woman

283
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,829
to pretend to be a high school student,

284
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:57,748
flirt with boys,

285
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,334
get those boys to sell her weed,

286
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,127
and then arrest them.

287
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,924
I don't like to use the word "cunt."

288
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,179
When I use it,
I want it to mean something.

289
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:17,142
That's a cunt. That lady's a piece of...
fucking human garbage.

290
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,853
You fucking asshole. Here's the thing.

291
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,314
Not only is it not fair,

292
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,150
that is one of the most sexist stories
you'll ever hear.

293
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,195
Here's why it's sexist.
It's sexist against boys. Here's why.

294
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,865
You could never imagine that story
if the genders were reversed.

295
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,246
If you found out that a 25-year-old man
was throwing dick

296
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,665
at your 17-year-old daughter,

297
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,085
and he talked her into selling him weed,

298
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,712
and then he arrested her,

299
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:50,342
we would light that motherfucker
on fire in the street. Right?

300
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,057
But if it was my own son
who got arrested by that cop,

301
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,977
I'd be like, "How'd it go?

302
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,395
Tell me what happened.

303
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,898
Record? You're worried about your record?
You got a story, dude. You got a...

304
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:09,319
You're the first guy ever
to get arrested by an undercover cop

305
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,113
you thought was his girlfriend.

306
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,450
That's a fucking hell of a story."

307
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,287
Some people are, like,
hard asses about it like,

308
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,581
"Shoulda known better.
He's almost 18."

309
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,042
Yeah, but he's almost 16 too.

310
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,421
Which is almost 15.
That's like a little kid.

311
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,257
Do you remember what you were like
when you were 17?

312
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,051
You didn't know
what the fuck was going on.

313
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,927
And this kid wasn't even a drug dealer.

314
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,307
This kid, it's not like he got caught.
No, this kid was a straight-A student

315
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,768
that thought he was getting pot
for his girlfriend.

316
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,312
He even tried to give it to her.
She wouldn't accept it.

317
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,731
She wanted to give him money,
so she could arrest him.

318
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,902
But he had to know,
he was a smart kid.

319
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,863
He had to know.
He had to know something was off.

320
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,990
'Cause here's what it's like:

321
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,452
a 25-year-old woman is not the same
as a 17-year-old girl.

322
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,704
They look similar,
but they're not the same.

323
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,166
Here's what it's like: I had this dog once
that I got from the pound.

324
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,128
You know how you get a dog...

325
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,506
"Are you comparing women to dogs?"
No!

326
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,382
You'll see.

327
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,931
The dog, she was a sweetheart
of a dog,

328
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,284
but she had been the pound too long,
she was real sketchy.

329
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:24,228
And I would bring her around other dogs,

330
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,997
and, like, when a dog has been
in the pound,

331
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,374
like, every other dog they think
is going to take their food

332
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,776
or take their bed.
So I take it to the dog park,

333
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:35,739
and she'd see dogs and go,
"Fuck off! Fuck off!"

334
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,158
And every dog would be like,
"Whoa, Jesus."

335
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,664
That's how she acted with every single dog
till one day,

336
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,291
one day I brought her to the dog park

337
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,168
and somebody brought a wolf.

338
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,258
Some fucking hippie asshole
with wooden beads on, wearing sandals,

339
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:58,220
this motherfucker brought a thing
that eats dogs

340
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,390
into a cage filled with dogs!

341
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,727
My dog looked at that wolf
and looked at me and went,

342
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,855
"That's not a fucking dog!

343
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,022
Aah!"

344
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:13,068
She knew.
I don't know how she knew.

345
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,903
She didn't grow up in Alaska.

346
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,739
She wasn't a Montana dog.
How the fuck did she know?

347
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,200
But she knew.

348
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,493
Somehow.

349
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,872
Somehow.

350
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,209
That had to be what it was like
when that 17-year-old boy

351
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,128
was around that 25-year-old woman.

352
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,255
Like, "Um, where'd you go to school?

353
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,382
Unh?"

354
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,552
She's like touching him.

355
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:46,059
'Cause 17-year-old girls don't sound
anything like 25-year-old women.

356
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,769
You ever talk to a 17-year-old kid?

357
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,497
They don't know
what the fuck they're saying.

358
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,648
They're basically just practicing talking.

359
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,945
They've only been talking
for, like, a few years.

360
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,449
They don't know
how to make shit sound good.

361
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,161
They're like, "Have you heard
the new Drake song? It's so fire!"

362
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,829
You're like...

363
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,833
Argh! What the fuck did you do to my ears?

364
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:19,134
Meanwhile the 25-year-old cop's like,
"Let's go back to my house,

365
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,887
smoke some pot,

366
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,972
and snuggle."

367
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,225
That kid's like...

368
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,685
"You have a house?

369
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,234
How the fuck did you get a house?"

370
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,695
Your dumb friends are like,
"She saves, bro.

371
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,200
My cousin did it,
my cousin bought a house."

372
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,285
Kids are always lying.
17-year-old kids.

373
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,038
"Yeah, my cousin bought three houses
by the time he was four."

374
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,082
What? Four?

375
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:57,005
Seventeen. "You should know better."
You know how crazy that is to say?

376
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:02,094
That is a short amount of time
on this planet, seventeen years old.

377
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,929
And it's a confusing time.

378
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,640
Maybe one of the most
confusing times ever for a boy,

379
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,519
because your life is a certain way
for 13 years,

380
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,105
and then you start getting
uncontrollable boners

381
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,815
right around 13 years in.

382
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,276
For 13 years you think you got
life mapped out.

383
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,612
"I get life, you do what you want,
you kind of have a good time.

384
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,739
You ride your bike
and you play your games,

385
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,116
hang out with your buddies."

386
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,660
And then suddenly two years later
you're waking up going,

387
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,454
"What do you want from me?"

388
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,207
And your dick's like...

389
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:33,667
Every day.

390
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:37,170
Every day. Confusion. "Do I love you?"

391
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,333
"What are you gonna do for a living, bro?"
Another thing you get when you're 17.

392
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,571
"What are you gonna do?
You're almost a man. Be a loser?"

393
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,055
"I don't know."

394
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,641
And then you see,
you see around you all these people

395
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,101
that are chasing bullshit.

396
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,854
Material possessions and nonsense lives,

397
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,857
doing things they hate
and getting stuck in a rut.

398
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,068
You don't want it to be you
and you don't know how to get out of that.

399
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,446
And everybody's confused
and everybody's like,

400
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,449
"Bro, what are you gonna do for a living?"
I don't know!

401
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,992
I don't know.

402
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,120
Just get together with your friends
and try to figure life out.

403
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,748
Unwind, hang out, smoke a little joint.

404
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,000
Like, 'Dude...

405
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,837
I think my girlfriend's a cop."

406
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,637
I'm like, "Dude, you're paranoid.

407
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,016
Trust me, it's the weed. There's no way."

408
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,643
Meanwhile, he was right.

409
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,605
Poor little fuck. Nobody cares.

410
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,192
'Cause nobody cares about boys.

411
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,195
Why? Listen, don't "aw." It's okay.

412
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,696
We're running shit.

413
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,452
It's the balance of power.
Look, it's... it's all for good.

414
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,330
So much tension.

415
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,626
'Cause, like,
this is a new time for jokes too,

416
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,087
because everything I say
on this Netflix special

417
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,132
is going to get me in trouble,
but I... I knew coming in.

418
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,861
But I want to explain to people
if they're mad at me.

419
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,970
Talk to me offstage,
I'm super reasonable.

420
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:13,016
But I say shit I don't mean
'cause it's funny.

421
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,104
Like, people should get that
but they don't get that, not in 2018.

422
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,356
Everybody wants to write it down
and make it literal.

423
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,566
"This is exactly what he said,
here's a quote."

424
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:26,238
"Hate! Let's end the hate! Enh!"

425
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,200
And people are way more sensitive now.

426
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,702
Because of the Internet,
everybody has an opinion

427
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,204
and they can all express it,

428
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,706
when that's not really necessary
for some folk.

429
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,584
Some folks, their opinion's not that good.

430
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,421
They should... keep it to themselves.

431
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:46,341
But today, anybody can express opinions.

432
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,470
I've gotten death threats for shit
I don't even remember saying.

433
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,807
Like, I did a podcast
with Tony Hinchcliffe,

434
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,601
and apparently I said
I thought pro wrestling was gay.

435
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,731
I don't even remember saying it.

436
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,234
But I got off the podcast

437
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,777
and I checked my Twitter,

438
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,155
and the fucking hurricane

439
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,741
of misspelled hate messages
that came my way.

440
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,702
I was like, "Aah!"

441
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,579
What have I done?

442
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,791
I didn't even mean what I said.

443
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,961
It was just a funny thing to say
in that moment 'cause he's so into it.

444
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:26,256
I'm like, "It's gay." It's funny to say!

445
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,344
"No, it's not ever funny to say."
Well, you don't hang out with my friends.

446
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,222
So I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

447
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,452
"Well, you're a homophobic piece of shit!
I wouldn't hang out with your friends!"

448
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,852
That's not true.

449
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,812
Here's where you're wrong. I...

450
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,691
'Cause people tell you
that you shouldn't say something's gay.

451
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,443
But I love gay people.

452
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,489
I've no problem with gay people.
I'm happy they're a real thing.

453
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,784
I really am. I like it, mix it up.
Who gives a shit?

454
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,498
So if you don't like me
calling things gay,

455
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:04,544
then what word would you like me
to use to describe gay shit?

456
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,217
What are we doing here, man?

457
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,304
There's certain noises we can't make
with our face anymore?

458
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,973
You know, I think the same fucking thing,
right?

459
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:23,396
Gay's not negative. It's just gay.
Okay?

460
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,315
There's certain things...

461
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,793
There's certain things that are gay
that have nothing to do with men

462
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,069
having sex with each other.

463
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,655
Like musicals.

464
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:34,824
Right? No one knows why.

465
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,493
They're just gay.

466
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,412
Men wearing pearls, gay as fuck.

467
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,458
It's not a negative.

468
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,002
And I don't really hate pro wrestling.

469
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,337
I was just talking shit.

470
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,632
Like, when I was a kid,
I loved Jimmy "The Superfly" Snuka,

471
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,469
and Bob Backlund, and Hulk Hogan,
and I love The Rock.

472
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,180
I go to his Twitter page every day
for inspiration.

473
00:25:57,556 --> 00:26:00,350
And who's not a fan of Ric Flair?

474
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,477
Woo!

475
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,854
We didn't rehearse that!

476
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,231
You knew what to do!

477
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:11,403
That man has an exuberant noise attached
to his name.

478
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,073
That's one of the most American things
of all time.

479
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,158
Right?

480
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,746
I was just talking shit.
That's all it was.

481
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:26,793
So Tony goes, "Listen, if you just
watch pro wrestling with me,

482
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,046
you'll love it, and you'll become a fan."

483
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,631
I'm like, "All right, dude.

484
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,550
Turn it on."

485
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,218
He turns it on!

486
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:39,639
I see a guy with shaved legs,
wearing Speedos,

487
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,142
with knee-high leather boots on,

488
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,936
and he's holding another guy down.

489
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:46,813
But not really.

490
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,526
The guy's like, "I can't even get up."

491
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,821
And the guy he's holding down
is wearing a leather mask!

492
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,074
I'm like, "What the fuck, Tony!

493
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,535
Have you watched this
with a critical eye?"

494
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,582
I'm not saying it's gay.

495
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,709
But let's just be honest.

496
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,462
Everywhere else on the planet,

497
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,172
other than that ring...

498
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,718
Everywhere else on Earth,

499
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,179
when a dude shows up shirtless,

500
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,723
wearing a leather mask and Speedos...

501
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,018
he's there to suck dicks.

502
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,020
Okay?

503
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,023
Period.

504
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,983
I don't care what you tell the cops.

505
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,279
That guy knew
what the fuck he was doing.

506
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,738
So there's going to be people mad at me
for that, but I just want you to know,

507
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,456
for a bunch of things.
Here's what's really important.

508
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,959
And I can't believe you've to do this,
but in 2018 you've to do this.

509
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,795
You've to say a joke and then you go,

510
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,922
"Hey, that's not..."
This is what I really feel.

511
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,007
This... this is what I really feel.

512
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,761
There's nothing wrong...
I don't want anybody thinking I'm a bigot.

513
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,930
There's nothing wrong with being gay,
nothing,

514
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,393
and there's nothing wrong
with being a fan of pro wrestling.

515
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,480
But it's the same thing.

516
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,857
To me.

517
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:18,029
I respect both of them.
I think both of them are amazing.

518
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,198
I'm super happy.

519
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,660
I've had some other death threats
this year.

520
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,330
I...
put a poster up,

521
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,125
put a picture up on Instagram
of some deer meat,

522
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,335
and I wrote, "This is some meat
from a deer

523
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,672
that liked to kick babies
and was about to join ISIS."

524
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,969
I was feeling real good about that post.

525
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:46,057
Then I got cocky and I wrote hashtag
#vegan and that's where I fucked up.

526
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:50,186
Ooh! That wasn't worth it.

527
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:52,480
That didn't feel good.

528
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,775
The hate, the anger!

529
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,069
Never in my life

530
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,447
have I encountered such a ruthless,

531
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,117
vicious group of kind,
compassionate people...

532
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,457
as I have in that fucking hashtag
#vegan group.

533
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,712
These vegans that are vegans
for good reasons, folks,

534
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,046
but the problem with vegans

535
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,049
is the problem with every single group
of human beings.

536
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:23,845
If you get a group of 100 people,
just pick a random 100 people,

537
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,931
what are the odds that one of them
is a fucking idiot?

538
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,350
It's 100%.

539
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,313
We nerf all the sharp edges in this world
and we let dummies survive.

540
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,398
There's no wolves
running through our streets.

541
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,777
It's 100% that one out of 100
is a fucking idiot.

542
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,822
Some of those are vegans,
and this is how it works:

543
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,868
if you got a group and you don't have
to take a test to get in there,

544
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,204
some of them are in there
for the right reasons.

545
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,748
Most vegans are vegans
'cause they're kind people.

546
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:54,250
They don't want anything to die
so they can live.

547
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,337
And those people are heroes,
'cause they're always tired,

548
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,590
they're cranky,
their health's all fucked up.

549
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,301
They're doing it
for all the right reasons.

550
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:09,140
But then there's vegans
who are really only vegans

551
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,351
'cause Scientology didn't find them first.

552
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,520
Okay?

553
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,480
You know.

554
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,690
Everybody knows certain vegans

555
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,152
that would have joined the Taliban
if they took the wrong flight, all right?

556
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,279
They're fucking dipshits.

557
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,158
Those guys always have "vegan"
in their name.

558
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,202
It's always like "vegan warrior."

559
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:32,205
They just start eating plants
and start talking shit.

560
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,331
They joined a gang.

561
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,291
It's a plant-based gang.

562
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,214
I don't argue with these people but I do

563
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,017
when they say something
totally crazy to me.

564
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,551
I will check their profile,

565
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,678
see what they're interested in.

566
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,264
And this one lady said something
really fucked up.

567
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,890
She wrote me, she goes,

568
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,643
"I hope animals eat your children
in front of you.

569
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,812
I hope everyone you know gets cancer.

570
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,647
I hope you die in your mother's arms."

571
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,940
And I'm like, "Well.

572
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,653
What's this healthy lady up to?"

573
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,992
So I go...

574
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,744
I go to her fucking page.

575
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,830
She has a bunch of hashtags, right?

576
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:17,000
Normal ones like hashtag #vegan,
hashtag #crueltyfree,

577
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,005
and then I seen one
that I've never seen before.

578
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,922
It says hashtag #vegancat.

579
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,635
I check my watch.

580
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,305
It's 1:00 in the morning, I'm like,
"Fuck, do I click this?"

581
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:37,103
I'm like, "I should just go to bed, right?
I should just go to sleep.

582
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,647
I shouldn't do this.

583
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,483
I should have some herbal tea
and read a book."

584
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,990
And there's the other part of your brain
like, "Shut up, pussy. Click it. Come on!

585
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,867
Come on!"
I always listen to that part.

586
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,870
That's the secret to my success,
I always listen...

587
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,039
"Come on, pussy! Come on!"

588
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
I click it.

589
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,060
I'm hoping... This is what I'm hoping.

590
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,086
I'm hoping hashtag #vegancat...

591
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,632
I'm hoping what that is
is, like, a support group.

592
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,051
Right?

593
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,722
Like, we all have friends
that are vegans that also have cats.

594
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:17,018
You go over to their house and
you're like, "So why are you vegan again?"

595
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,604
"Well, I just don't think it's our right
to decide

596
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,190
that an animal should live or die."

597
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,193
And then they open up
a fat can of murder

598
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:28,363
and give it to that little fucking
psychopath that they live with.

599
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,031
And you're like, "Hey.

600
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,617
Hey, man. What's in that fucking can?

601
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,953
What are you doing?"

602
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,331
"Well, he's a carnivore
but I'm an herbivore."

603
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,209
If you are a vegan with a pet cat,

604
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,586
that's like being a doctor
with a pet vampire.

605
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,422
Pick a team, fuck face.

606
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:47,799
What are you doing?

607
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,093
You live with a murderer! Okay?

608
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,304
If you love animals, just shoot
that cat right in the fucking head.

609
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,557
That thing eats 200 animals a year.

610
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,020
That is what I was hoping.

611
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,232
That's what I was hoping
hashtag #vegancat meant.

612
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,109
But no.

613
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,818
No.

614
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,489
#vegancat is a whole fucking community
of people

615
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,534
who think it's a good idea
to feed your cat salad.

616
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,122
Now,

617
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,083
before I go any further,

618
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,961
it's very important that I be
completely truthful to you,

619
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,506
'cause people call you out all the time.
It's always some guy. "Actually...

620
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,342
Actually you can feed your cat
a vegan diet."

621
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,554
They do that little cunt nod.
You know that thing that people do?

622
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,515
They tell you something and then...

623
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,892
Is that the worst?

624
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,520
Even if they're right, you're like,
"Fuck you and your facts.

625
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,731
This fucking face thing you're doing."

626
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,109
But he's right.

627
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:49,652
You can...

628
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,279
feed your cat a vegan diet

629
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:55,992
if you don't mind them going blind...
and dying young.

630
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,037
"Is he serious?"
Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

631
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,623
You will, after this show,
go on your phone

632
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,835
and check out hashtag #vegancat,

633
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,547
and you will be treated
to a collection of pets

634
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,300
that look like they live in a house
with a gas leak.

635
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:19,348
Every fucking cat is like,
"When is the real food coming?

636
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:23,811
What the fuck is..."
They're all lying down! I'm not joking!

637
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,815
Every fucking cat.
You're gonna go, "He's right!"

638
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,733
They're all lying down! All of 'em!

639
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:34,155
And they die young! Really fucking young!

640
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,574
They take pictures, these fucking psychos.

641
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:41,120
"RIP Tabby!
We had five amazing years together!"

642
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,082
The cat's eyes are milky,
its legs are stiff. It's like...

643
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:47,001
"What is this lady feeding me?

644
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,504
Where's the real food, bitch?"

645
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,133
It's a cat! You got to feed it cat food!

646
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,385
"Hashtag #crueltyfree."

647
00:34:56,552 --> 00:35:00,223
Tell that to your blind, dead cat,
you fucking crazy asshole!

648
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,685
It's a cat! Okay?

649
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,146
It doesn't want to eat mashed potatoes!

650
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:12,035
It makes us uncomfortable that something
would want to kill something

651
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,172
because what if someone wants to kill us?
I don't want that. That's what it is.

652
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:18,241
It's just weird panic that we have
about our own mortality.

653
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,826
But it's a real simple system.

654
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,411
If this comes up in an argument,
feel free to use this.

655
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:23,495
This is how it works:

656
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,414
Green shit grows out of the ground,

657
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,375
dumb shit eats the green shit,

658
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,377
mean shit kills the dumb shit.

659
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,629
That's your cat.

660
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,650
That's why you don't have to hack your way
through a river of bunny rabbits

661
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,385
to get your fucking Prius every morning.
Okay?

662
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,596
You can't feed that thing cranberries.

663
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,272
"We went to see Joe Rogan
and he hates gays and cats.

664
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,859
I am currently blogging about it."

665
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,241
None of this is true.
I love gay people and I have cats,

666
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,743
and my cats are fluffy, which is gay.

667
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,206
I have gay things that I love.

668
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,418
I listened to Miley Cyrus music
right before I got onstage tonight.

669
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,421
There's plenty of gay things I love.

670
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,717
I have those fluffy, those Monsanto,
GMO cats. You ever see those cats?

671
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,844
Like, how the fuck
did that turn into that?

672
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,556
You see a cat in a tundra
and then you see my fucking thing.

673
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,976
They're called Ragdolls because,
like... I don't know you, ma'am,

674
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,912
but if you came to my house,
you could scoop that cat up,

675
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,706
they wouldn't get nervous.
"Who's this crazy lady?"

676
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,524
They wouldn't... Anybody could just pick
one of those cats up

677
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:37,486
and put it on their shoulder,
and they'd just go limp.

678
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,031
'Cause I have a seven-year-old daughter.

679
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:43,326
My daughter just scoops that cat up
like a sandbag in a CrossFit class,

680
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,411
and she's barely got this fucking cat,

681
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,538
and they just limp.

682
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,664
Purring away.

683
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,249
So happy to be touched.

684
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,544
They have almost no instincts. Almost.

685
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,254
Almost!

686
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,591
'Cause those little fuckers
will sit in front of the window.

687
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,761
And they see a squirrel across the street,

688
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,471
their eyes lock on that squirrel,

689
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,914
and they start making these
involuntary mouth noises like...

690
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,023
You ever see your cat do that?
It's so fucking creepy!

691
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,460
They don't even know you're there.

692
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,570
You can get right next to them, like,
"What the fuck are you doing, man?"

693
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,114
They don't even look at you.

694
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,700
I've had that cat since it was a baby.

695
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,118
It's never been outside.

696
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,996
Three-year-old cat, never been outside.

697
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,083
And he sees those squirrels
across the street and he's like...

698
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,043
"I remember.

699
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,924
I remember the old way."

700
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,223
How the fuck does that DNA
get into that cat?

701
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,534
He's not looking at that squirrel like,

702
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,520
"That's my little friend
across the street. I'd like to meet him!"

703
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,439
No, it's like,
"Your neck is right there."

704
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,902
That's crazy.

705
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,571
That's some crazy, murderous DNA.

706
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,616
That's like if you had
a science experiment

707
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,537
where you had a man in captivity,
and you never showed him a woman ever,

708
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,997
until he was full grown,

709
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,916
and then you show him a naked one
through prison glass.

710
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,544
And as soon as he sees her,
he goes, "Time to fuck!

711
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,589
Time... time to fucking fuck!"

712
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,136
Dudes come over with clipboards.
"How do you know?

713
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,471
How do you know what to do?"
"I know what I know, bro!

714
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:31,559
I know when it's fuck time!
It's fuckety fuckin'!"

715
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,812
That's what it's like for that cat.

716
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,732
How the fuck does that cat know
what to do?

717
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,485
Explain that to me, science.

718
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,949
Cats kill everything they can.

719
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,451
Dogs will keep it together.

720
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,746
If you've a good dog,
a good dog will keep it together.

721
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,373
Like, you could could have a pet dog
and a pet hamster,

722
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,585
and that pet hamster,
if you got a good dog,

723
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,087
that pet hamster could live a long life.

724
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,134
But you got a pet cat and a pet hamster,

725
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,094
that hamster's got an hour to live.

726
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,557
And that's just 'cause your cat's
going to torture it for 59 minutes.

727
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,352
That poor little fucker's like,
"I think he's done!

728
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,563
Finally it's gonna let me get away
and I'm just gonna be free!"

729
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,149
And the cat's like,
"Not today, motherfucker.

730
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,736
Not today. You just stick the fuck down."

731
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,781
It's what they do.

732
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,035
You can't feed 'em apples.
It's what they do.

733
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,454
Dogs care.

734
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,916
You can put a hamster on the floor
in a room with a good dog.

735
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,502
A good dog will look at you,
look at the hamster.

736
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,672
Look at you, look at the hamster.

737
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,800
He'd be like, "Um...

738
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,886
can I fuck him up?"

739
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:52,056
"No! That's Mr. Fluffers!

740
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,976
Mr. Fluffers is the newest member
of our family!"

741
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,272
The dog just starts calculating,
like, "Okay, okay.

742
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,985
Okay, okay. I like free food.

743
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,530
These people are nice to me. Okay.

744
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,117
That's a fucking rat, dude.
That's a rat!

745
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,035
Okay. Okay.

746
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,287
Okay, family. Yeah. Family, family!"

747
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,683
You can tell, though, when that dog's
not totally on board,

748
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,685
they just get a little too close
to that hamster like,

749
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,503
"Ooh! I was gonna fuck you up."

750
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,929
But a cat, you don't have a chance.

751
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,557
Cats, they will make Exorcist noises.

752
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,678
You can try to hold your cat in a room
with a hamster, your cat starts going...

753
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:46,086
He's letting you know, "Bitch,

754
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:49,070
I'm about to claw your fucking eyes out!
You'll never see your kids again!"

755
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,450
They don't care how long
you been feeding them.

756
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:55,161
They don't care about your history
of free massages.

757
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,039
"There's a rat on the floor!
If you let me go, I can kill the rat!"

758
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,756
And people keep those things as pets.
That's what's so fucked up.

759
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,469
Imagine if your kid did that,
a kid that you couldn't have in a room

760
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,822
with something smaller than him,
he's like, "Gotta kill, Mommy!

761
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,264
Murder! Kill!"

762
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,891
Like, "Junior, sit down!"

763
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,309
"No! Fuck you!

764
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,185
Death!"

765
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,191
"Well, we just can't have a pet cat,
'cause Junior breaks the cat's neck.

766
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,276
He's crazy. I don't know what to do."

767
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,489
We just accept the fact
this fucking cat's a murderer.

768
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,534
Can't feed that thing cranberries,
you crazy bitch.

769
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,621
Okay? You're the monster.

770
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,999
Dogs feel bad when they kill things too
if you're mad.

771
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,183
Like if your dog kills a hamster
and you're like, "How could you!"

772
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,296
"How could I?

773
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,383
Shit! Did I do that?

774
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,551
Damn it!"

775
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,804
"I'm so disappointed in you."

776
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,640
"I'm disappointed in myself!

777
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,520
I'm sorry!"

778
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,441
They walk to you sideways.
"I fucked up, dude. Fucking seriously."

779
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,530
But your cat,
the cat doesn't feel remotely bad.

780
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,866
Your cat kills something,
you're like, "How could you?"

781
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:18,911
He's like, "Bitch, you know me."

782
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,255
He'll walk away slow
with his tail in the air

783
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,456
so you can see his asshole.

784
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,713
They don't care. You scream at him.
"You're a monster!"

785
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,007
They pull their ears back.
Like, "Why you so loud?"

786
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,320
And just lie down right in front of you
and lick their own dick.

787
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:39,723
"How about you just shut the fuck up
while I lick my dick?"

788
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,019
They don't care.

789
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,647
They don't care about you.

790
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,818
Cats know when you're high too.

791
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,029
They seem to know, you're vulnerable.

792
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,948
Dogs don't have a clue.

793
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,243
You come home high, your dog's like,
"You're extra friendly today!"

794
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:05,249
If I'm watching Black Mirror
at 1:00 in the morning,

795
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,876
my cat will, like, sit down
next to me and be like...

796
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:12,006
"You know you're going to die, right?"

797
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,181
Creepy little fuckers.

798
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,435
Something...

799
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,731
something spooky about predators,
living with a little predator.

800
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,023
You know?

801
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,191
I think it's good for us.

802
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,152
I think it's good for us to be nervous.

803
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,402
I really do.

804
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,322
I think we all need Jesus.

805
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,077
I grew up... I was raised Catholic
for a little while,

806
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,371
and then I wised up
when I was about seven.

807
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,998
And, um...

808
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,085
Since then, I was like, that discipline
is probably pretty good for people.

809
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,757
One of the things that gets me about, um,
people that are really into Jesus is that

810
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,760
you're supposed to think
that Jesus is going to return.

811
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,262
But if he did, you'd never believe it.

812
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,889
Right?

813
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,184
Like, nobody believes new miracles.

814
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,396
If someone came up to you and go,
"Yo, dude. You gotta meet my cousin.

815
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,733
He was dead for three days
and he came back to life

816
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,318
and he hangs out with hookers,

817
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,779
but he don't fuck 'em,
he only gives 'em advice.

818
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,699
Want me to give him your number?"

819
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,494
You'd be like,
"Yeah, sounds like a good idea.

820
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,912
I want to talk to him forever.

821
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,081
He sounds totally legit."

822
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,336
No, we only like old miracles.

823
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,881
But I think there's a new miracle
that we might have missed,

824
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,444
and I'm going to tell you this story.

825
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,762
There was a woman who was born in Africa,
she had a birth defect.

826
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:44,223
She was born without a vagina.

827
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:47,601
Grew to be a full grown woman,
she had no other problems.

828
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,269
Grew to be a full grown woman,

829
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,815
gave a guy a blowjob,
and then got into a knife fight.

830
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,318
The knife went through her stomach,

831
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,987
the sperm hitched the ride
on the blade,

832
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,698
and landed on her eggs.

833
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,741
She got pregnant.

834
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,703
Nine months later, by cesarean section,

835
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,914
they open her up like a sleeping bag
and pull out a normal kid.

836
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,875
That's a real fucking story.

837
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,169
You're like, "The Fear Factor guy
just makes shit up

838
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,797
to make his stupid fucking jokes work.

839
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,677
That's why they took our phones away,
so we can't call him out on his bullshit."

840
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,682
No, I'm telling you a true story.

841
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,059
Y'all don't yell. It's true.

842
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:32,771
A woman without a vagina gave birth
to a kid.

843
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,814
Now...

844
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,692
here's my question.

845
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,819
Isn't that a miracle?

846
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,779
That seems like a miracle.

847
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,238
Like, if you...

848
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,283
People that believe in Jesus,

849
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,452
you're supposed to believe
he's going to come back.

850
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,638
But if he's going to come back,

851
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,789
do you think he'd come back
looking like Jesus?

852
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,499
Wouldn't that be super obvious?

853
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,627
We'd see him coming.
We'd see the robe

854
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:57,605
and the beard, like,
"Dude, that's Jesus. Hold my hand."

855
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,174
♪ Kumbaya my Lord♪

856
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,884
♪ Kumbaya ♪

857
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,261
"Hi, Jesus.
We didn't even know you were coming.

858
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,847
This is what we do."

859
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,392
Jesus'd be like,
"I don't know."

860
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,354
I think if is Jesus is going to return

861
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,356
and find out what we've really been up to,

862
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,610
he's going to return as
the miracle-blowjob knife-fight baby.

863
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:27,618
And we'd never even see it coming,

864
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,995
'cause we're not looking for it.

865
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,998
That kid's got to go to school.

866
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,544
Other kids are going
to ask questions... right?

867
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,297
You remember what childhood was like.
Kids are fucking brutal.

868
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,590
Everybody's insecure,

869
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,610
so they try to find someone
more insecure than them

870
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,718
and fuck with 'em.

871
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,846
I had a good childhood,
but it was weird.

872
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,141
And it was weird because my parents
split up when I was young,

873
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:54,311
and then my mom lived
with my stepdad for a few years

874
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,605
before they got married,
and we moved a lot.

875
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,106
It wasn't bad, but it was...

876
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,943
Kids would ask questions like,
"Hey, man, is that your dad?"

877
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,072
"No, it's my mom's... boyfriend."

878
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,617
"So it's a dude who fucks your mom?"

879
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,623
"Hey, man, I'm eight.

880
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,879
What about your parents?"

881
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,714
"Dude, Dude!

882
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:28,011
My parents have been married
since high school.

883
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:31,598
The first time my mom and dad
ever had sex,

884
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,267
my mom got pregnant with me.

885
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:35,936
Bro...

886
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,731
my dad cries a lot.

887
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,776
He just cries!

888
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,862
He'll just fall down and start crying.

889
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,405
We ignore him now.

890
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,658
No one cares.

891
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,327
Step over him, pass the peas.
We don't give a shit.

892
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,746
This poor fucker's just weeping
on the ground.

893
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,833
Life isn't a movie, man.

894
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,543
I never saw that in a movie.

895
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,754
Life's not a fucking movie, dude.
Life is hard."

896
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,839
"Yeah, man.

897
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,925
Yeah, dude, life is hard, dude.

898
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,136
It really is. It's fucking hard.

899
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,515
What's your story, Mutombo?"

900
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,394
"You know!

901
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,563
Same old story.

902
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,901
Mom ain't got no vagina.

903
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,529
Suck a dick, get stabbed.

904
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,531
Here I am.

905
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,911
You know, could be worse.
Hashtag #blessed."

906
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,834
From the humblest of beginnings,

907
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,004
he'd be around us as we judged him.

908
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:46,882
Change our ways.

909
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:48,926
We should change our ways.

910
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,820
The first thing we gotta do
is stop doing this.

911
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:51,929
You know what that is?

912
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:54,389
That's the symbol of the cross
where Jesus was murdered.

913
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:56,308
We got to stop doing this.

914
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,976
Start doing this.

915
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,398
Love... and life.

916
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,692
Love and life, brothers and sisters.

917
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,782
Don't get mad at me!
You knew why you came here!

918
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,452
You get mad. We're a fucking hour in.

919
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,704
If you're mad now... Jesus Christ!

920
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,414
Woo!

921
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,000
"Your point of view is terrible."

922
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:25,170
Yeah, it's how I make a living.

923
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:28,066
I say fucked-up shit.
You don't have the time to think up.

924
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:29,090
That's all it is.

925
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,677
Listen.

926
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,929
Violence against women isn't funny.

927
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,348
I don't know why you're laughing.
You guys are assholes.

928
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,558
Ass-holes!

929
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,687
"Especially in this day and age.

930
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,772
Ooh!

931
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:45,941
Dangerous time.

932
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,612
My own mom said this to me.
She goes...

933
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:53,115
"I just wish
that Hillary Clinton was president,

934
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,449
because I think it's about time

935
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:57,285
a woman does the most important job
in the world."

936
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,537
Okay.

937
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,333
I'm like, "Yeah, but you already make
all the people."

938
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,673
Like...

939
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:13,385
I'm not saying, ladies,
that that's the only thing you can do.

940
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,512
You make all the humans.

941
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,889
That's a big fucking deal.

942
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,642
There's seven billion people
on the planet.

943
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,478
All of them came out of a woman's body.

944
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,108
If babies came out of dude's dicks,
there'd be six of us.

945
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,030
An abortion would be an app
on your phone.

946
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:34,990
All right?

947
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,159
It'd be snowing out,
you'd pull your phone out,

948
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,242
"Fuck this kid.

949
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,788
I'm not shoveling snow
and breastfeeding."

950
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:46,251
How about that, ladies?
You make food with your tits!

951
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,504
You know how goddamn crazy that is?

952
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,841
You make the most nutritious
baby food known to man,

953
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,635
with your tits,
while you're doing other shit.

954
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,641
'Cause no one's giving you
enough credit for it,

955
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,686
because so many of you can do it.
That's the problem.

956
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,814
Almost every woman can make people.
That's the problem.

957
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,524
If only one lady did it,

958
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:12,402
one giant bitch
that lived in the middle of the city...

959
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:16,281
She had a huge, clear abdomen

960
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,909
with all our children floating around
inside of it.

961
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,453
We'd bring her food and blessings.

962
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:26,124
That's just as weird as a baby
coming out of a person.

963
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,668
We're just used to our weird.

964
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,230
But if that was the way you did it
and someone just said,

965
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,466
"I'm making my own people. Look."
You'd be like, "Aah!"

966
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,804
If people didn't come out of people
and then they started,

967
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,597
we would freak the fuck out.

968
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,349
We'd be like, "What's next?"

969
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,227
No, the problem with the thing is,

970
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:50,107
when you... childbirth, you have to be
in the room to really understand it.

971
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,568
It's not like a thing you watch
in a video and go, "I get it."

972
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,487
You think you get it,

973
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,281
but you never get to see the kid
unless it's yours.

974
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,242
No one lets you watch.

975
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,369
Your friends never let you watch.

976
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,371
Even my sister wouldn't let me watch.

977
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,833
I go, "What do you think?
I'm gonna get horny and fuck you? Come on!

978
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,167
Let me see the kid!

979
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,128
I want to see my nephew."

980
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:14,339
Nobody lets you in. Nobody.

981
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,757
It's got to be your kid.

982
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,050
By then it's too late.

983
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:20,762
'Cause you see the kid come out,
you're like,"

984
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,806
Okay."

985
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,183
And then you start thinking,
"How often is this happening?

986
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:29,521
This is happening right now
all over the world!"

987
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,730
But you don't get to see it.

988
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,067
There's a website you can go to
where you can see the actual numbers.

989
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,862
You can see every time a baby
is registered as being born.

990
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,073
There's like a world population number
and that number is like this...

991
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,243
It's just fucking spinning.

992
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,578
It's not sustainable.

993
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:47,581
It's not like, "Well, we gained
a few people, we lost a few people.

994
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,332
Keeping a healthy balance
here on Earth."

995
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,586
No, it's just people shooting loads
into each other, just fucking...

996
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:56,631
Eating food and coming
in each other.

997
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:00,594
You just don't see it.
But if there was a place you could see it,

998
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:03,722
like if there was a giant
drive-thru movie screen,

999
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,058
and it was every baby coming out
of every vagina

1000
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,269
in real-time all over the world,
you'd be like,

1001
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:11,396
"It's a fucking invasion!"

1002
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,232
You'd be like,
"My God, now I get it!

1003
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,943
The vagina is a portal
to another dimension.

1004
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,863
It's like a well of souls
and they're coming through

1005
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,490
with pleasure and love and confusing us!

1006
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:25,243
And then they grow up
and they do whatever the fuck they want!

1007
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,454
This is how culture gets shaped!

1008
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,332
From aliens from another dimension!"

1009
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,625
Ladies...

1010
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,629
you do that.

1011
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,173
You make people.

1012
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,175
You make all the people.

1013
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:46,723
And you want to be president too?
You fucking greedy bitches. Jesus Christ!

1014
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,560
What else do you want?
You want bigger dicks than us?

1015
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,270
You want all the money?

1016
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:57,317
If I was a woman,
I'd definitely be a feminist. 100%.

1017
00:53:57,609 --> 00:53:59,194
Men are bigger,
they make more money,

1018
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,154
they always try to fuck you,
they lie to you.

1019
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,572
That's too many things.

1020
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,992
It's too many. It's not balanced.

1021
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:08,245
I get it, ladies.

1022
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,038
You know what I don't get?

1023
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,748
Men's rights activists.

1024
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,127
Every one I've ever met,
I want to go, "Dude,

1025
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:17,587
we got all the rights.

1026
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,298
We got 'em all."

1027
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,927
Fucking relax! The problem is,

1028
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,389
guys that are clamoring for,
"What about men's rights?"

1029
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,891
They're going to pay attention
to what we do.

1030
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,434
This is the thing.

1031
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,771
If girls start doing an audit
of what men do versus what women do,

1032
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,439
it's a big fucking difference.

1033
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,651
Men cause all war.

1034
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,656
That is somehow or another
some weird fact that slipped us by.

1035
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,660
Can you imagine if women caused
all the war?

1036
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,372
How long would it take
before we were like,

1037
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,375
"Yo, we got to kill these
fucking crazy bitches.

1038
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,168
Dude,

1039
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,005
I came home, the girls are in the backyard
making a plane

1040
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,841
to fly over the ocean
and fuck people up they never met.

1041
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,217
These bitches are bloodthirsty.

1042
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,262
They never want to stay put,
constantly conquering new ground,

1043
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:08,888
stealing people's oil."

1044
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,557
Can you imagine?

1045
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:15,645
"What about men's rights?"
Shut the fuck up. Stop.

1046
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,898
Men cause most of the murder.

1047
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,900
Men cause most of the rape.

1048
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:21,901
A guy stops me.

1049
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,238
"Actually, here's a statistic
you're probably not aware of.

1050
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,700
But men actually get raped
more than women."

1051
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,954
Yeah, by other men, you fucking dipshit!

1052
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,665
Jesus Christ!

1053
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,126
You're making my point for me,
you stupid fuck.

1054
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,046
What did you think was happening?

1055
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:46,426
When you heard that number you're like,
"No more investigations needed.

1056
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,598
Clearly there's packs of cheerleaders
out there raping soldiers.

1057
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,975
We got to put a stop to it."

1058
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,523
No, men are so gross,
we fuck each other.

1059
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,820
See, I say that and no one gets mad.

1060
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,283
No men are like, "Bro, you're fucking
generalizing massively.

1061
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:16,623
It's such a douchebag move
to just criticize an entire gender."

1062
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,877
Men don't care, 'cause I'm one of you,
and you know.

1063
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,380
Like if I say guys jerk off
to basketball games, you're like,

1064
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,715
"Some of us.

1065
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,799
For sure."

1066
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,470
Right? But if I say anything

1067
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,390
even remotely critical about women,

1068
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,142
people will get really mad.

1069
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,602
Watch.

1070
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,110
Ladies, I love you.

1071
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,195
You're some of my favorite people.

1072
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,572
But let's be honest,

1073
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,783
you don't invent a lot of shit.

1074
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,121
Ooh! Feel that?

1075
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,705
Yeah!

1076
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,999
That's some ride-home arguments
in the air.

1077
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:04,295
Right? You can feel the tension.
"No, you were laughing. It's not funny.

1078
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:07,132
You were fucking laughing! It's sexist!

1079
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,134
No, he makes fun of men first

1080
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,928
so he can make fun of women later,
you fucking moron.

1081
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:15,515
My God, you don't even know comedy.
You don't even know what you like.

1082
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,183
Drop me off.
Just fucking drop me off.

1083
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:19,853
Just... drop me off."

1084
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:25,066
But you know I'm right.
Here's what's important about this.

1085
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,069
When it comes to inventions,
we're talking about inventions.

1086
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:32,073
Let's be really clear.
I am a fucking moron.

1087
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,742
Okay? I've never invented shit.

1088
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,579
And I'm guessing
you're probably pretty dumb too,

1089
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,290
which is why you're here
listening to me talk.

1090
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,253
Okay, let's just be honest.

1091
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,006
We're not talking about us.

1092
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,176
We're talking about inventors.

1093
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,635
Okay, it's not us.

1094
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,763
Why do we have to be on Team Penis
versus Team Vagina on this one?

1095
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:56,847
It's crazy.

1096
00:57:56,931 --> 00:58:00,226
The men and the women in this room,
we have more in common with each other

1097
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,521
than we do with those
fucking freaks out there

1098
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:06,441
inventing all the shit we need
to make our life awesome.

1099
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:08,943
Okay?

1100
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,529
But those freaks out there inventing shit

1101
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:13,990
are almost all dudes.

1102
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,367
And I don't know why.

1103
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,953
But that makes me feel like a winner.

1104
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,541
I feel like I won.

1105
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,877
I really do. I feel pretty good.

1106
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,847
And I'm looking around
at some of you ladies

1107
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,130
and you look like losers.

1108
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,175
You look like you lost.

1109
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,969
You're not even in the contest.
You're like, "Hey!

1110
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,431
I don't like this part."

1111
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,166
If you'd your phone you'd be like,

1112
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:42,477
"Surely women have invented
a bunch of things."

1113
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:45,104
No, they haven't. I wish they had.

1114
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,651
Women invented, like, 40 things ever.

1115
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,237
And it was all shit they needed.

1116
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,118
A woman invented
the dishwashing machine.

1117
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:07,210
I didn't even write a joke for that. I'll
let you figure out why you're laughing.

1118
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,672
Can't call me out on a non-existent
sexist joke.

1119
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,215
It's just a fact.

1120
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,844
Women invented some
very important things, actually.

1121
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:19,305
Like, no bullshit, all jokes aside,

1122
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,015
a woman invented Kevlar,

1123
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:24,477
which is the bulletproof material they use
for first responder vests.

1124
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:29,232
Who knows how many lives were saved
because of one woman's invention?

1125
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:33,235
But!

1126
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:37,365
I bet it was probably a chick
who wanted to shoot her husband...

1127
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:42,203
but she didn't want him to die,

1128
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:45,832
'cause then she'd have to get a job.
She's like,"

1129
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,421
There's got to be a way

1130
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:55,091
to shoot this motherfucker
and still sleep in."

1131
00:59:56,926 --> 01:00:00,555
Again, I'm a fucking moron!
Don't get mad at me!

1132
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,141
We're just talking about inventors.

1133
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,893
I don't want to leave any
really important women inventors

1134
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:08,146
on the list
who are all way smarter than me,

1135
01:00:08,229 --> 01:00:10,398
but, like, one of them was Hedy Lamarr,

1136
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:12,650
a gorgeous actress from the 1940s.

1137
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,236
She invented spread spectrum technology,

1138
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:18,114
which is how we use GPS
and Wi-Fi today.

1139
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,407
This one woman did that.

1140
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,885
But she was hot, no one cared.
They were just trying to fuck her.

1141
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,912
Nobody paid attention
to anything smart she said.

1142
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,289
They had to wait until she died.

1143
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:28,750
They're going through her notes,
like, "Fucking Wi-Fi."

1144
01:00:31,085 --> 01:00:34,881
Yeah. 'Cause we're gross!
I already told you we're gross.

1145
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,384
A woman invented
the first hypodermic needle.

1146
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,888
It was one woman's idea of how
to effectively get medication into people.

1147
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,723
Who knows how many lives she saved?

1148
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,975
One woman's idea

1149
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,645
was computer coding. One woman.

1150
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,647
She invented the computer code.

1151
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:53,107
Without her contribution, who knows?

1152
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,233
One person.

1153
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,486
Without this one woman's contribution,

1154
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:59,113
who knows where technology would be today?

1155
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:01,323
After that...

1156
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:02,992
big drop off.

1157
01:01:04,535 --> 01:01:06,454
I mean, fucking, like a cliff.

1158
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:12,293
The number 11 most impressive invention
by a woman is the chocolate chip cookie.

1159
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,296
Again, I'm a fucking idiot.

1160
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:17,298
Way better than anything I'll invent.

1161
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,301
But a dude invented the chocolate chip

1162
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,178
and a dude invented the cookie,

1163
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,472
and he probably just wanted
to go to bed.

1164
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:29,143
He was probably like, "You nailed it.
You're an inventor. Goodnight."

1165
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:31,521
She's got her chef's hat on.
"Write it down.

1166
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,898
Write it down."

1167
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,822
I'll leave you with this
'cause it's uncomfortable but also true.

1168
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,908
A man invented the tampon.

1169
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,078
Let that soak in.

1170
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:51,165
How'd I do that to you?

1171
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,127
I had to. That's what you have
to say right there. I know.

1172
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:57,422
But for real,
a tampon is not a good invention.

1173
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,591
It's just one of those things
that's been around for a long time,

1174
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,093
but it's like a legacy invention.

1175
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,554
It seems like a male solution

1176
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:06,848
to a body part he doesn't have

1177
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,058
and a problem he doesn't understand.

1178
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:10,976
Like, "What?

1179
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,229
What's going on?

1180
01:02:13,479 --> 01:02:15,565
Aah! Just stuff something up there!"

1181
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,947
No woman is ever going to invent a tampon!

1182
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,741
A woman would have invent a maxi pad.

1183
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,160
Like, "Hey, hey, stupid.
We're not stuffing anything.

1184
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,620
We're just going to take this,
put it there, leave it alone.

1185
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,788
It will be fine."

1186
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,540
"Fuck that!

1187
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,001
We're gonna make a cotton dick
and just stuff it up there.

1188
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:37,086
Get in there."

1189
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:38,671
"What if it gets stuck?"

1190
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,555
"I'm going to put a rope on the end of it
and yank it out like a fish."

1191
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,719
Thank you, Boston!

1192
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:47,346
I had a great fucking time!
I love you, people!

1193
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:53,728
For real, it makes me incredibly happy
to be able to do this here.

1194
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:57,064
This is where I started.
You people are the shit and I love you.

1195
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,608
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

1196
01:02:59,233 --> 01:03:00,233
Thank you!

1197
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:35,812
