1
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,932
Go ahead and do the lights.

2
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:26,647
Go ahead.

3
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,991
Ladies and gentlemen, Louis C.K.

4
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:14,869
Hello.

5
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,695
Thank you.

6
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,708
Thank you very much.

7
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,542
Thank you.

8
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,293
Um...

9
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,586
So, you know, I think abortion is, um...

10
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,626
I...

11
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:33,546
Here's what I think.

12
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,505
Here's what I... This is what I think.

13
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,813
Here's what I think. I...

14
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:46,192
I think you should not get an abortion
unless you need one.

15
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:53,072
In which case...
In which case, you'd better get one.

16
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,284
I mean, seriously.

17
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,203
If you need an abortion,
you'd better get one.

18
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,001
Don't fuck around.

19
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:03,209
And hurry.

20
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,589
Not getting an abortion
that you need is like not taking a shit.

21
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,711
That's how bad that is.

22
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,176
It's like not taking a shit.

23
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,679
That's what I think.

24
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,264
I think abortion is exactly like
taking a shit.

25
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:24,557
I think it is 100%
the exact same thing as taking a shit.

26
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,057
Or it isn't.

27
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,398
It is, or it isn't.

28
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,489
It's either taking a shit,
or it's killing a baby.

29
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,332
It's only one of those two things.

30
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,457
It's no other things.

31
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,133
If you didn't like hearing
it's like taking a shit,

32
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:54,722
you think it's killing a baby.
That's the only other one you get to have.

33
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:58,718
Which means you should be holding a sign
in front of the place.

34
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:04,848
People hate abortion protesters.
They're so shrill and awful.

35
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:07,805
They think babies are being murdered.

36
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,898
What are they supposed to be like?
"Uh, that's not cool."

37
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,113
I don't wanna be a dick about it, though.

38
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,781
I don't want to ruin their day as they
murder several babies all the time.

39
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,497
I don't think it's killing a baby.
I don't.

40
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,619
I mean, it is, it's a little bit...

41
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,707
It's a little bit killing a baby.
It's a little bit...

42
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:36,473
It's 100% killing a baby.
It's totally killing a whole baby.

43
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:45,017
But I think that women should be allowed
to kill babies.

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,020
That's what I think.

45
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:48,308
They should be allowed to kill babies.

46
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,522
Yeah.

47
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,280
Whoo!

48
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,204
We get to kill babies!

49
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,987
Let's do some shots and kill some babies.

50
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:07,405
I killed like four babies last night.
It was fucking retarded.

51
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:14,915
It has to be one or the other.

52
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:19,965
You know, like, when people say,
abortion should be legal, safe and rare.

53
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,851
Why rare if it should be legal?

54
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,970
If it should be legal,
it's... It's shitting.

55
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,900
If it should be rare,
it's murdering babies.

56
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,400
But, again, women should be allowed
because...

57
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,901
Two reasons I think women
should be allowed to kill babies.

58
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:41,066
Number one,
I don't think life is that important.

59
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,908
It's just not.

60
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,332
It is not.

61
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,501
People get too excited...

62
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,627
about life. "Oh, life."

63
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,919
Fuck you. It's not that...

64
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,883
Make a list of every shitty thing ever,
that's in life.

65
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,889
Life is okay. I like life.

66
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,308
I like it. I don't need it.

67
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,104
I'd be fine without it.

68
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,193
I like life, though. I do.
You know how much I like life?

69
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,936
I have never killed myself.

70
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,198
- That's how much I like it.
- Whoo!

71
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:25,617
That's exactly how much I like it,
with a razor-thin margin.

72
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,163
I like it precisely enough
to not kill myself.

73
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,457
It's an option, though.
It's totally an option.

74
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,416
I mean, I'm 49. I have two kids.

75
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,800
I've flipped through the brochure
a few times.

76
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:44,094
I've thought of killing myself just
to win an argument.

77
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:51,313
Not supposed to talk about suicide,
even to your shrink.

78
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:55,523
You ever go to a shrink and they're like,
"Have you had thoughts... of suicide?"

79
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,685
And you're like, "No, because
if I say yes, you'll press a button,

80
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,185
and folks will run in and hold me...
"Hold him down!"

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,534
You should talk about it.

82
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:11,035
The whole world is just made of people
who didn't kill themselves today.

83
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,291
That's who's here.

84
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,094
It's all of us that went,
"Okay, fuck it, keep doing it."

85
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:22,966
It's...

86
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,306
It's an interesting thing about life.

87
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,848
Life can get very difficult,
very sad, very upsetting.

88
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,562
But you don't have to do it.
You don't have to do it.

89
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,023
You don't have to do anything.

90
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,443
You never have to do anything
because you can kill yourself.

91
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,777
If they send you a letter
from Motor Vehicles, come in and:

92
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,362
"No, I don't. I'll kill myself."

93
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,405
You can do that. You can do that once.

94
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:49,832
But you can do it.

95
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,050
It's interesting because even when life
gets bad, people choose it over nothing.

96
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,798
Even the worst versions of life,
even a shitty, shitty life,

97
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,127
is worth living, apparently.

98
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,345
'Cause folks are living the fuck out
of them.

99
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,023
Have you ever seen somebody, you're like,
"He should kill himself.

100
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,191
Why did he not... that dude..."

101
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,400
Ever been driving and you look
in the next car, you're like, "Ugh, shit.

102
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,700
I wish I hadn't looked in that car.

103
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,117
That was difficult to glance at...

104
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,618
let alone being it."

105
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:34,288
Just a guy in a...

106
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,289
In a tan car.

107
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,384
Nobody chooses tan.

108
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,262
Nobody picks tan for their car.

109
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,796
They give you tan.

110
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,347
"Is that mine?" "Yeah, it's yours,
fucking loser. Made it tan."

111
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,851
They shouldn't even make tan cars.
It's mean to make them.

112
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:04,402
You look over, you see a guy in a tan car
with dents all over it

113
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,074
and a garbage bag for a window.

114
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,544
What is holding up his suicide?

115
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,132
What is delaying it?

116
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:26,418
What is keeping him
from stopping being that?

117
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,138
And what would it take?

118
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,640
What would it take?

119
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,886
What would it take?

120
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,516
Both windows are garbage bags? Is that...?

121
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:50,531
Seriously, do you know how much misery
is involved in a garbage bag for a window?

122
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,663
Do you know how many separate moments
of shit misery?

123
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:01,418
"They canceled my insurance.
I broke my window.

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,330
Duct tape."

125
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:11,222
Here's the truth. Running away will not
solve your problems. That's totally true.

126
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,471
But killing yourself solves
all your problems.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,970
It actually does.

128
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,385
It even solves world's problems.

129
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,977
For you.

130
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,444
"Hey, what about ISIS?"

131
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,440
"Kill yourself.

132
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,266
Then they'll never get you."

133
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,275
Seriously,
if everybody who's afraid of ISIS

134
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,822
kills themselves right now,

135
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,704
then ISIS loses.

136
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,374
Because they live in a world of people
that don't give a shit.

137
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,331
"We're gonna cut his head off!"

138
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,628
"Yeah, okay."

139
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,756
"It's not fun now."

140
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,483
I think the worst part
of being beheaded...

141
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,152
If...

142
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,280
The worst thing about being beheaded
is that you look really dumb right after.

143
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,572
That's the worst part.

144
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,525
They go like that, and you're like:
"Duh."

145
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,204
Just that fucking dopey...

146
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,840
I don't think they like beheading
bald people 'cause they can't do this...

147
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,918
That's the best part.

148
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,798
They got to go like this.

149
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,047
It's not as cool.

150
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,639
So, just shave the top of your head,
and you won't have to worry about it.

151
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,351
So, that's the first reason.

152
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,110
That's the first reason I think
women should be allowed to kill babies.

153
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,738
'Cause life is not so important.

154
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,872
The second reason
is because that's their job.

155
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,539
Women have to decide who lives and dies.

156
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,869
That's because they're the female
of the species.

157
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,375
In the reproductive arena,
that's what the female does.

158
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,708
They are the selectors.
They have to decide this.

159
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:13,463
We give them this responsibility
when we fuck them.

160
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,928
We go, "Here, you decide
what to do with this shit."

161
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,465
See you later.

162
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,270
She has to figure out
if you should have kids,

163
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,979
if she should have them. That's her job.
Because women have judgment.

164
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,395
They have judgment.
Men don't have judgment.

165
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,476
Men have intent.

166
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:37,609
Men just want to spray the world
with their cum, just mist.

167
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,873
"More of me.

168
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,287
More of me."

169
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:00,601
It's her job to go,
"That's enough of you, I think.

170
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,644
No, that's really enough."

171
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,108
I don't think that face needs to repeat.

172
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,614
I've seen your father,
and it's not getting better.

173
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,704
She doesn't realize this
until after you fuck her.

174
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,542
That's actually when she really knows,
is when you're like, "Yeah!"

175
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,329
And she's like, "I'm not having
this piece of shit's baby."

176
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,747
And that's why abortion is the last line
of defense

177
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,219
against shitty people in the species.

178
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:42,891
So, we need them
to abort every shitty baby.

179
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,646
I mean, all animals do this.
Animals do it late.

180
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,364
They have the baby.

181
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,228
Then they're like, "You know what?
It's cold. I'm gonna eat this one."

182
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,829
"But when is it okay?
When should they be allowed?"

183
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,411
When it's in their pussy.
That whole time.

184
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,334
It's in her pussy.

185
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,842
If there's a dude in your pussy,
you get to kill him.

186
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,376
I think that's pretty fundamental.

187
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,764
You're allowed to kill people
if they're in your house.

188
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,482
So... that's what I think.

189
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,652
I have two kids.

190
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,076
I try to be a better person
around my kids.

191
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,040
I try to change my behavior around them.

192
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,121
Like, I have rules in my house,
they all apply to me.

193
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,959
Like, I have a rule
that I don't curse around my kids.

194
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,210
That's a rule. It does happen.

195
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,297
You have a stressful moment,
and you're with your kids,

196
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,388
so, you say something by mistake.

197
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:08,139
One time I was making dinner for my kids,
and I gave my daughter a bowl of soup.

198
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,101
And I said, "Here's your fucking soup."

199
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,726
But, uh...

200
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:21,569
You can see
how that was a tough... situation.

201
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:31,954
You're supposed to teach your kids right
from wrong. I don't know, it's confusing.

202
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,788
Some people raise their kids religiously
and that covers it.

203
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,004
They kind of go, all this. Do that.

204
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:41,883
I'm not raising my kids religiously
because I don't feel like it.

205
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,133
Get up on a Sunday? Fuck that.

206
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,137
Fuck that.

207
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,060
Let your souls rot, kids. I don't care.
I'm not getting...

208
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,234
"Daddy, who's Jesus?"
"None of your business. Go back to bed."

209
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,980
But my kids, they're living in the world.

210
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,197
There's a lot of religion in the world.
You have to teach your kids.

211
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,488
If you're not raising them religiously,
you teach them about religion.

212
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:08,953
I tell my kids the same thing.

213
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,873
I tell them that there are many religions
in the world, and they're all equal.

214
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,464
But the Christians are the main one.

215
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,754
That's what I tell them.

216
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:19,134
The Christians won.

217
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,424
They're the winners.

218
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,263
So, act accordingly.

219
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,757
Congratulate Christians
when you meet them.

220
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,010
Because they won the world.

221
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,433
And it's true. It's true.

222
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:37,936
We love to tell ourselves, like,
"Every religion is exactly..."

223
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,060
No. No, they're not.

224
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,651
The Christians won everything.

225
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,817
A long time ago.

226
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,069
If you don't believe me, let me ask you
a question. What year is it?

227
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,252
I mean, come on.

228
00:15:56,038 --> 00:16:00,748
What year is it according
to the entire human race?

229
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,836
And why?

230
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,837
What year is it? Anybody?
Sir, just yell out the year.

231
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,297
Thank you. 20... 2016?

232
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,184
No, it's 20... That's right.

233
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,932
It's 2017. What is that?

234
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:15,095
That's a number.

235
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,681
It's not just any number.

236
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,687
It must be a very important number.

237
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:23,021
'Cause we're counting to it
in unison as a species.

238
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,689
For thousands of years, we've been going:

239
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:29,526
"One, two, three...

240
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,624
Come on, everybody, four... "

241
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:35,329
Now, come on, Africa, five, six..."

242
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,118
What is this number?

243
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,498
We're counting the days since what?

244
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,626
Since there was ever people?

245
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,593
Or since the sun did something?

246
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,298
Not at all.

247
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,099
It's been 2017 years since what?
Anybody, yell it out.

248
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,274
Christ!

249
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,267
Yes. Christ!

250
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,321
Christ!

251
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,936
That's right.

252
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:16,451
It's been 2017 years since Christ!

253
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,001
Jesus.

254
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:26,836
We are counting the days since Jesus.

255
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,378
Together.

256
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,839
Which makes sense if you're Christian.

257
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,506
But what the fuck
are the rest of us doing?

258
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:43,104
"Jesus was here. Jesus was here.
Jesus was here."

259
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,727
Everybody. Scientists, historians.

260
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,566
"Jesus.

261
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,944
Jesus."

262
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:56,027
"Jesus plus two, Jesus plus three,
Jesus plus four."

263
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:04,998
Jesus plus 2017 years,
four months and three days

264
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,844
is when your license expires.

265
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,642
How is that not a win for the Christians?

266
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,810
How is that not a complete win?

267
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,059
That's not a Monday off in October.

268
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,360
That's, "There was no time before Jesus."

269
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,361
And the whole world went, "Okay.

270
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,160
Sure."

271
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,827
Then somebody was like,
"What about the years before him?

272
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,410
There were billions. I mean, infinity."

273
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,617
"Those go backwards."

274
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,587
"You want us to measure most
of history backwards?

275
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,719
To accommodate one religion?"

276
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,215
Uh-huh.

277
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,598
"All right, we'll do it, it's fine.
We'll do it."

278
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,939
The whole world. You ever watch
New Year's Eve around the world?

279
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,192
They always show you how every country
celebrates. It's kind of cool.

280
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,185
The first is one little island.

281
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,947
It's the first place that's actually
the place that it's the year.

282
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,121
It's a little island in the Pacific.
I forget.

283
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,410
They do a little ceremony
for New Year's Eve every year.

284
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,285
And they just wear grass.

285
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:28,714
'Cause they don't even have sticks yet.
They're in the grass age.

286
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,924
They have no clocks.

287
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:33,707
But they do a dance.

288
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,349
"2017."

289
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,440
And it goes around the world,
"Oh, the 2017."

290
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:57,283
"Death to all Christians in 2017."

291
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,448
The Jews are quietly keeping track.

292
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,538
It's really 5,766.

293
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,383
But that's for us. We're just...

294
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:10,997
That's okay.

295
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,628
We're keeping track for when you
snap out of it. It's all right. I'll...

296
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,426
I'll write yours on my check.
I don't want a problem.

297
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,720
What about Chinese New Year?

298
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,099
Yeah, what about Chinese New Year?

299
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,522
All right,
next time you're doing your taxes,

300
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,073
just write "monkey" where the year goes.

301
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,486
Just put monkey.

302
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,701
See what happens to your funds.

303
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:50,043
No. It's 2017, year of our Lord...

304
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,288
Jesus o'clock on the nose.

305
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:57,415
And they made it up,
that's the weirdest part.

306
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:01,796
They got to rename years
that had already taken place.

307
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,683
'Cause, you know,
that's not what those years were.

308
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,389
You know that, right?
That the year three...

309
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,098
wasn't the year three...

310
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,153
during the year three.

311
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,444
Nobody was walking around back then,
"Hey, what year is it?" "It's three."

312
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,869
"Yeah, but I'm 28.

313
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,248
How can I be 28...

314
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,503
if there's only been three?"

315
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:39,631
"Oh, well, see, you were born in BC 24.

316
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,342
And there's a zero.
Remember it went backwards?

317
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,886
Oh, shit. That was stressful.
I hated those years."

318
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:47,809
What was that like?

319
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,184
"What year is it?" "Ten."

320
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,190
"What year is it now?" "Nine."

321
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,113
What the fuck is gonna happen?!

322
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,083
So, I don't know what to tell my kids.

323
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:10,078
My kids, they wanted a dog.
So, I got them a dog.

324
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,672
I got them a dog, which was a mistake.
I shouldn't have gotten the dog.

325
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,249
Because we rescued a dog.

326
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,835
- We got a... we adopt...
- Whoo!

327
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,090
Yes, you must re... yes, always rescue.

328
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,891
If you get a dog, get a rescue dog.

329
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,469
Don't get a puppy...

330
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:32,603
from those horrible people
who professionally raise dogs carefully.

331
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,021
No.

332
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,225
You need to just get a mystery dog...

333
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,820
that's been beaten and abused

334
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:47,866
and traumatized
on the streets of Puerto Rico.

335
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:52,079
And can't talk about it to anyone now.

336
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,622
They never know.

337
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,094
"Do you know anything about the dog?"
"Uh, she's afraid of pennies.

338
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:03,974
So, we think maybe somebody's been
throwing handfuls of pennies at her face.

339
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,844
But, otherwise, no."

340
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,719
So, you take this random dog

341
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,766
and just put it in your house
with your family,

342
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,730
and watch their personality unfold.

343
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,943
This dog is insane.

344
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,533
I'll walk into the kitchen, and the dog
is just standing there alone like this...

345
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,540
I'm like, "You all right?

346
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,876
Are you all right?"

347
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,246
My kids are terrified of the dog.

348
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,300
My daughter goes to pet the dog,
dog goes like...

349
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:49,012
She's like, "Should I pet her?" "I don't
think you should ever pet our dog, honey."

350
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,345
I took her to the vet.
I took the dog to ask her what to do.

351
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,725
The vet said,
"Listen, I think there's something

352
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,312
you should seriously consider."

353
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,193
I was like,
"Please be saying to kill this dog.

354
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:07,025
Please be a doctor
that says the dog dies now."

355
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,986
But she didn't. She said...

356
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:16,117
She said, "I think you should consider
Prozac... for the dog."

357
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,495
I was like, "Really?"

358
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,291
She said, "Yeah, it works.
It calms the dog right down.

359
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,956
But it's a big decision,
and you should think about it."

360
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,665
I said,
"Put four in her asshole right now.

361
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,425
What do I have to think about?

362
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,138
I don't give a shit
what she's experiencing.

363
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,233
Fucking fix it.

364
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,111
Give her heroin. Shoot her up."

365
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,195
"Come on, puppy."

366
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,995
"Wow, your dog is really chill."

367
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:03,214
"Yeah.

368
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,589
It only costs $400 a day
to keep her like that."

369
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,851
I didn't always feel this way.
I used to love animals.

370
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,680
I used to worry about animals.

371
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,184
Just animals.

372
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:23,114
When I was like 20,
"Are all the doggies okay everywhere?

373
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,282
I certainly hope so."

374
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,487
But I'm 49, and I got two kids now.

375
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:34,491
You know what happens?
Your circle of concern tightens.

376
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,954
I have four nephews.
I don't love any of them.

377
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,672
Fuck a dog.

378
00:25:47,588 --> 00:25:51,008
You know those ads, like the PSA
on television about abused animals?

379
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,051
They show you a dog with, like,
an empty socket, and he's like...

380
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,680
And they're always wet.

381
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,523
I feel like they hose them down
before they film them.

382
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,901
And the voice comes on,
"Look at these dogs.

383
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:08,571
These dogs are beaten every day.

384
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,950
Please send us money
so that this can stop."

385
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:18,040
Are you beating up the dogs?

386
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,119
How's my money fixing that?

387
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,258
You see that PSA
where they show you a sad man?

388
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:31,839
He's very upset, a very sad man.

389
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:35,094
He's holding a little sign,
and it says, "Yeah, sure."

390
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,639
And he says, "This is the text
that killed my daughter."

391
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:43,347
'Cause somebody texted, "Yeah, sure,"
and ran over his kid, which is awful.

392
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,942
Although maybe they were responding
to a text

393
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,193
that said,
"Can you please kill that kid?"

394
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,153
And so, they just...

395
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,439
wrote back and did it.

396
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,451
I'm not saying that makes it better.

397
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,952
I'm just saying
we don't have all the information.

398
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,878
My kids and I were having breakfast
the other day,

399
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,962
and we're listening to NPR.

400
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,626
We always listen to NPR,
because we're better than you.

401
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,215
And...

402
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,345
We're listening to NPR
at breakfast the other morning.

403
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,100
There was this story
where they kept using this phrase.

404
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,483
They kept saying, "9/11 deniers."

405
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:26,654
They kept saying that.

406
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,524
"9/11 deniers."

407
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,984
And my daughter was like, "What is that?"

408
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,952
I said, "Well, it's a group of people that
think September 11th was a conspiracy."

409
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:41,331
And she said, "Oh, I thought
they were saying nine 11-deniers."

410
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:53,384
Yeah, she thought they meant nine people
who just ain't buying this 11 bullshit.

411
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:01,224
Just a small fringe group, really.
There's only nine of them.

412
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,055
But they still got on NPR.

413
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:08,562
They got on the radio
because... they're dedicated.

414
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,573
They protest every day.

415
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:15,488
They're the nine 11-deniers.

416
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:20,949
They're outside of the White House,
"It goes, 10, 12, 13!

417
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,327
Me and my eight friends know it!

418
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,166
We are the nine 11-deniers.

419
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:38,087
We know that 11 is a bullshit number...

420
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,852
propagated on the people by the man.

421
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,390
Why do we have 11?

422
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,814
When we have 13,

423
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,732
and 14 and 15...

424
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:58,149
and 16, 17,

425
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:02,319
motherfucking 18, and 19,

426
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:06,123
but we do not have a one-teen.

427
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:11,039
What happened to one-teen?

428
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,707
The government took one-teen,

429
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,585
and replaced it
with some bullshit called 11.

430
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,180
We are the nine that deny that shit.

431
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:31,193
Mr. President, give us back one-teen!"

432
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:41,146
I don't mean to offend
any Chinese people with this stereotype.

433
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,662
But...

434
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:46,537
"That's right, I'm Chinese, motherfuckers.

435
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,995
I'm from Beijing.

436
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,044
I lived in Shanghai.

437
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:57,959
I'm Chinese-er than a motherfucker.

438
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,467
Chopsticks and whatnot."

439
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,470
Ha! All right.

440
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,175
I'm sorry.

441
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:08,968
Here's the thing...

442
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,518
stereotypes are harmful.

443
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,306
That's the truth.
But the voices are funny.

444
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,605
And I don't know how
to reconcile those two facts.

445
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,486
I enjoy doing the voices.

446
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:25,195
But they're offensive.
So, I do them at home.

447
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:27,578
I used to do them for my kids.

448
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,909
They liked them,
didn't know it was a race thing.

449
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,405
They enjoyed it. "Do the friendly man."

450
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,127
"You want me
to be the friendly man, little girl?"

451
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,666
"We love the friendly man."

452
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:40,464
"He loves little white girls.

453
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,757
Let's have some scrambled eggs."

454
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,482
They grew up, and I was like,

455
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,480
"Don't talk about the friendly man
at school.

456
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,517
Maybe don't talk to your teachers
about that."

457
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,243
My kids go to public school
in New York City.

458
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:08,332
Yeah, all right.

459
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,742
Send your kids there then.

460
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:13,752
Yeah, it's good. It's good.

461
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,422
To teach them
that that's what life is like.

462
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,589
The teachers amaze me because...
I don't know, the worst...

463
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,800
Here's the worst thing about this country,
is that there's no more noble profession

464
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,513
than to be a public school teacher.

465
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,353
Please. Please, don't.

466
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,808
You're not gonna like it.

467
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,308
You're not gonna like where it's going.

468
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:35,483
I don't recommend clapping at any things.

469
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,023
You'll regret it at the end of the thing.

470
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,491
In a democracy, there's no more
noble contribution you can make

471
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,160
than to teach in a public school.

472
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:51,579
In this country, the people that do that,
they're fucking losers.

473
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:57,122
They're just rock-bottom fucking losers!

474
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,708
And everybody knows it,
but they keep doing it.

475
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:09,467
New people are teaching every day,
knowing how shitty it is.

476
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,676
They show up, tell them ahead of time.

477
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,473
"Hi, what is this job?"

478
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,887
And they say,
"Okay, here's what we need you to do.

479
00:32:15,976 --> 00:32:20,686
We need you to make children know math."

480
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,650
Wow.

481
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,950
"Do they wanna know math?"
"No, they don't want to know it.

482
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,866
You need to make them know it
against their will.

483
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:36,078
While they're exploding sexually
and beating the shit out of each other."

484
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,213
"Who are these children?"

485
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,335
"Just whatever kids live
near the building."

486
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:58,135
Heh. "How much do I get paid?"
"About $10 every four years."

487
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,522
"What if I get good at it? What happens?"

488
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:05,818
"Nothing. Nothing happens.

489
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:09,316
Nobody notices, and you get fired,
and you die alone."

490
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,826
"Okay, I'll try it for 25 years."

491
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,169
My daughter is learning
about Greek mythology.

492
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,380
And she's asking me questions about it.

493
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,749
She's like,
"Daddy, who's Achilles' mother?"

494
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,545
I said, "I don't fucking know.
Don't ask me that shit.

495
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,804
I don't know who Achilles' mother."
Don't yell out if you know.

496
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,345
"It's Campampetes."
Nobody cares what you know.

497
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,977
She had a question about Achilles,
it was interesting.

498
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:44,111
I'll tell it to you. But first,
the story of Achilles real quick.

499
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,189
Achilles was a baby.

500
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,654
He was a Greek baby.

501
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,525
And... he didn't stay that way.

502
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,373
But when he was... a Greek baby,

503
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,789
his mother, who was a goddess,
took him to the River Styx,

504
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,710
which is at Hades, the land of the dead.

505
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,122
And she dipped him in the water
of the River Styx

506
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,378
because there was a magical quality
to that water

507
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:09,461
that you would make you impervious
of any harm.

508
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,628
You couldn't be hurt.

509
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,089
It was like a shield, right?

510
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:15,009
So, she dipped him in that water
to protect him.

511
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,264
But she held him by the heel.

512
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,270
That's the important detail.

513
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:23,349
Held him by the heel,
which is an awkward way to hold a baby.

514
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,148
By the heel.

515
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:31,323
Try holding a baby by the heel
and dipping it in a river.

516
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,200
You will never see that baby again.

517
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,285
That's how to get rid of a baby.

518
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,711
"I lost the baby in the water.

519
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,593
I was trying to wash him,
and he fell in the river.

520
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,514
I'm sorry, Miss Achilles,
I lost your baby.

521
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,808
You told me to hold him by the heel.

522
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,521
He slipped."

523
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,098
Because Achilles' mother
has a Mexican nanny.

524
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,733
It's a lesser-known character
in <i>The Iliad.</i>

525
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:10,396
Anyway...

526
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:16,619
his mother, she was able to hold on,
of course, because she was a goddess.

527
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:19,695
She was the goddess of grip or whatever,
I don't know.

528
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,623
And she held on.

529
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,252
And then he was protected,
except on his heel.

530
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,711
His heel was not protected.

531
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,290
And so that's what we call
your Achilles heel,

532
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,086
your one vulnerable place.

533
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,010
Everybody's got their Achilles heel.

534
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,377
Achilles' Achilles heel was his heel.

535
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:39,349
Like, literally.

536
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,350
Anyway, so, my daughter,
here was her question.

537
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:50,817
She said, "How come his mother
didn't just dip him again?

538
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,435
She could have just dipped him
one more time...

539
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,823
with the other leg in there."

540
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,994
What does she just, like, get...
You're right there.

541
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,714
Was there, like, a sign that says,
"One dip per goddess"?

542
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,460
You ever color an Easter egg?
It's not that complicated.

543
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,922
You dip it, and then you hold
it differently and dip it again.

544
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,682
Smart kid. I was proud of her.

545
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,349
But at the same time, I thought, "Who
the fuck are you to judge this woman?"

546
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:24,465
It bothered me.

547
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,603
'Cause here's what the story
of Achilles teaches me,

548
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,396
is that, if you're a parent,

549
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,519
it's never enough what you do
for these motherfuckers.

550
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,608
It's just never enough.

551
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,701
It's still gonna be your fault.

552
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,659
How much more do you want from a mother?

553
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:48,831
She dipped her kid in magic water
and protected 99% of his body.

554
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,632
Is any of it up to him?

555
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:56,377
He could have just wore a big shoe
and be careful.

556
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:02,926
But he goes out in sandals,
fucking flip flops.

557
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,354
And a sword, and fights the whole planet.

558
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:10,354
"I'm Achilles 'cause my mother dipped me."

559
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,364
Finally, somebody got him in the heel,
and he's like, "Mom!

560
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,782
Thanks a lot, Mom."

561
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,118
"What's wrong, Achilles?"
"My mom didn't dip my heel.

562
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:31,708
She's so stupid. She ruined it."

563
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,132
Fuck you, Achilles, you Greek dick.

564
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,801
I hate the way people talk
about their mothers.

565
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,802
I was watching a football game,

566
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,056
and this guy scored a bunch of shit,
whatever, and they were excited.

567
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,386
So, they asked him about it afterwards.

568
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:51,685
And the football player said,
"My mom died last year,

569
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:56,273
but I know she was watching my game
from heaven tonight."

570
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:59,819
And I wanted to be there to say,
"Leave your mother alone.

571
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,031
How dare you.

572
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,735
She's dead."

573
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:07,293
I mean, when are you done
with your fucking kids?

574
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:12,714
When are you finished
with your fucking kids?

575
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:17,593
Even after you're dead, you still have
to go to their fucking games and shit?

576
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,308
Leave your mother alone.

577
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,727
She did her job.
She raised you, and it killed her.

578
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,730
Let her enjoy heaven. Don't you want
your mother to enjoy heaven?

579
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,067
Isn't that what you want?
Your mom to be just in heaven.

580
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,162
Whee! This poor woman. Angels were like,

581
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,489
"We're having a party.
You want to come with us?"

582
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:49,288
"I can't. I got to watch my son's game.

583
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,080
He'll be very upset.

584
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,923
Okay, go... He can't fucking hear me.
Why am I doing this?"

585
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:02,471
I just think when people die,
it means they did their jobs.

586
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,089
And you should forget them.

587
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,215
That's what I think.

588
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:08,643
'Cause it's unfair what we put
on dead people.

589
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:12,431
"Are you watching over me?"
"Yes, I'm watching all of it."

590
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,612
You know like an old...
When you see an old couple,

591
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,570
they've been married for, like, 60 years?

592
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,570
You know that story?
Everybody loves that.

593
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:26,032
The people that always get applause based
on the math of their lives.

594
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,989
"How long you been married?"
"Sixty years."

595
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,156
Aw.

596
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,292
Aw.

597
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:39,039
Isn't that automatically wonderful?

598
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,713
How do you know?

599
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,837
You just know how long it's been.

600
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,720
For 60 years, every morning,
he tells me I'm a piece of shit.

601
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,650
Let's just say
this is a happy couple, okay?

602
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,531
They love each other.
They've been married for 60 years.

603
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,072
That's longer
than most people wanna be alive.

604
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,414
And they've been together that long.

605
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,449
And now they're just an old couple.
And they just walk together.

606
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,164
You know when you see two people...

607
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,578
They don't need anybody else,
just the two of them.

608
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:18,464
This is both of them. They just walk.

609
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,802
They always walk somewhere,
nobody walks there. There's trash.

610
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,724
There's trucks.

611
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,100
He's wearing a suit that is not a color.

612
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:40,186
She's wearing a dress that's like
a triangle, like a kid drew it.

613
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,361
It's just, fucking,
a dress with fruit on it.

614
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,531
Nobody cares.

615
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,855
And they just walk every day.

616
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,954
It's cold.

617
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:52,866
Yeah, it's cold.

618
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,115
You want to go to the store
and get a cracker?

619
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,125
Yeah, let's get a cracker
at the store.

620
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:04,166
Yeah.

621
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:17,177
And then one day, usually he dies first.

622
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:20,063
They're walking, and he goes...

623
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,188
And she says, "Richard!"

624
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,695
"Richard!"

625
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,541
And he dies.

626
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,462
So, now it's just her.

627
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,594
Just Rose.

628
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:47,509
And she's alone.

629
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,919
And now she just stands in their house.

630
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,006
Somebody goes to get Rose
'cause there's a wedding.

631
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:58,809
"Come on, Rose. Nadine's getting married.

632
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:01,517
Nadine...
It doesn't matter, just fucking come on.

633
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,030
Come on. Fucking come on.

634
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,147
Fuck!"

635
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,861
Just want to push her from beh...

636
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:17,615
She lives ten more years.

637
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,619
Ten years after Richard dies.

638
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,708
And then ten years later,
now she's laying in a bed.

639
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,917
She's dying.

640
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,422
Somebody's there with her, on their phone.

641
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,217
So, Rose is dying, and she says:

642
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:44,806
"Well, at least now
I get to be with my Richard... forever."

643
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,612
Where did she get that idea?

644
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,651
Where did that come from?

645
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,361
I've looked it up.

646
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:53,738
No religion teaches

647
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:58,162
that when you die, you get to ruin heaven
for your dead spouse.

648
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,584
Why is that fair?

649
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,408
Who gets...

650
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,923
Richard's been dead for ten years.

651
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,420
He's been in heaven for ten years.

652
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,591
And somebody comes up to him,
"Hey, your wife is coming."

653
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,427
"What?

654
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,096
Excuse me. What did you just walk up
and say to me just now?"

655
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,108
"Yeah, Rose just died.
She'll be here in about 20 minutes.

656
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,282
They've just got to hose her down
and tape the wings on.

657
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,281
And then you're gonna be together
forever."

658
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,498
"Wait a minute. Fuck.

659
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,213
You said this was heaven. Why is this...

660
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,460
I have a girlfriend here now.
I don't wanna fucking... "

661
00:43:53,548 --> 00:43:56,878
"She's the love of your life." "She's not
the love of my death, motherfucker."

662
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,435
That's marriage. Marriage is a big deal.

663
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,559
Marriage is a big deal.

664
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,605
I went to a wedding the other day.
I went to a gay wedding.

665
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,730
I've been to a lot of gay weddings,
which is not true.

666
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,659
It's not true at all.
But... I did go to one.

667
00:44:21,826 --> 00:44:24,446
But I don't go to weddings, generally,

668
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,157
because I don't like them. I hate it.

669
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:30,587
Don't invite me. Really. I think it's rude
to invite people to your wedding. I do.

670
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,125
Nobody's happy to get that shit.

671
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:34,964
You make it all pretty.

672
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:39,007
And they're like, "Aw, fuck!
This is gonna suck!"

673
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,060
"Here's a helpful list of places
to stay... "

674
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,600
"Oh, great.
I get to live in a La Quinta...

675
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,151
in Reading, Pennsylvania

676
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,067
for three days...

677
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,990
because you want to get married
for a couple of years."

678
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,530
Nobody wants to watch you
start your shitty thing.

679
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,658
Nobody wants to see it.

680
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:09,832
Everybody's in a shitty thing.
That's what it is to be with somebody.

681
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,089
You're either alone,
or you're in a shitty thing.

682
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,884
That covers 100% of human beings.

683
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:22,094
I can see there's young couples here.
You're like, "No, we're in a good one...

684
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,259
It's really good."

685
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:26,267
"Yeah, fuck you.
Who do you think you are?

686
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,939
It just didn't get shitty yet.

687
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,984
So arrogant."
"Yeah, I think we figured it out."

688
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,984
"No... Yeah, you're the first ones."

689
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,276
Of course it's going to get shitty.
That's part of it.

690
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,572
It's like going to a horror movie,

691
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,578
and in the first minute, you're like,
"I think they're all gonna be fine."

692
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,412
No, they're all gonna die.

693
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,248
And you're gonna hate the person
you love right now.

694
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,134
That's the way it works.
Love plus time minus distance equals hate.

695
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,463
That's just the way it goes.

696
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,680
I'm not saying don't do it.
You should do it.

697
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,893
It's the best thing.
It's the best part of life, love is.

698
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:09,933
But don't be greedy and expect it to last.

699
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:15,611
Don't be amazed that a butterfly died
'cause you shot it in the face.

700
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,025
Just fall in love, make a fucking mess.

701
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,990
It goes shitty,
you don't realize it until too late.

702
00:46:25,074 --> 00:46:28,164
And then you cry a lot and move on.
It's the best part of life.

703
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,326
It is. I've always loved love.

704
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:37,174
It's always been my favorite part of life
is meeting somebody and going, "Oh, shit!

705
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,705
That person!" That's the best feeling.

706
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:43,217
Now, why the fuck would that just,
"Oh, yeah!

707
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:48,137
For years, for our whole lives,
just, aw, yeah!"

708
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,726
That's insane to expect that.

709
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,812
It's a little thing you get to catch.

710
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,979
And then it rots and dies.
That's just the way it goes.

711
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:04,196
It's like if you see a person in the park
making bubbles with a big wand with soap.

712
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,621
And sometimes they make a really big one,
and everybody goes, "Oh, yeah!

713
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,370
Shit. Okay, that's all."

714
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,420
You don't stand over it, "Liar!"
You don't get mad at the soap stain.

715
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,128
It gets so shitty, man.

716
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,087
It does.

717
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:25,715
Whoo!

718
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:30,807
All the little intricate parts.
Like, I was in an e-mail fight recently.

719
00:47:31,891 --> 00:47:33,231
You ever been in an e-mail fight?

720
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,939
Some of you are in an e-mail fight
right now.

721
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,359
You know, an e-mail fight.
Not a text fight.

722
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,980
A text fight is like, "Fuck you." Boop!

723
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,448
"Yeah, fuck you." Byew.

724
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,739
"Dick." Boop!

725
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,865
"Asshole." Byew.

726
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,246
That's a text fight.

727
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:59,710
An e-mail fight is like, "In June
when I told you that I had this issue,

728
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:04,474
I was very disappointed
in the way you didn't listen."

729
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,724
You know, those e-mails,
you just work on it all night.

730
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:12,806
Like it's the closing argument
to a murder case.

731
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,600
It's so important, your fucking e-mail.

732
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:22,019
You're pounding it out like Beethoven,
and you're pouring water on your head,

733
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:25,278
and going deaf and still working on it.

734
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,204
And then you send it somebody.

735
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,990
"Can you read this
and tell me if it's fair what I wrote?

736
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,247
Start at the bottom."

737
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:39,883
And they write back,
"I made a few changes."

738
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:43,209
"Oh, thank you.
That really captures my voice. And yet..."

739
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,590
You send it to somebody else,
they're like:

740
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:51,724
"I would take out 'Eat shit, fuck face, '
because it clouds your better points."

741
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:55,559
And you're like,
"Fuck you, I'm going to keep it."

742
00:48:58,144 --> 00:48:59,774
And then finally, you send it.

743
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,146
And you're like, "Hmm."

744
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:07,651
And then you feel really good.
"I finally said it. Finally."

745
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,032
And you have this fantasy that they're
at home reading it right now going...

746
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:19,792
I'm wrong about all of the things.

747
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,802
During the day,
they haven't written back yet,

748
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:31,183
and you know
it's 'cause you just bewitched them.

749
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,386
And you decide,
"I'm going to read my e-mail.

750
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,557
I'm going to read the e-mail
that I wrote."

751
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,942
Is there any more disgusting
modern human behavior

752
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:49,066
than reading
your own already sent e-mails?

753
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:55,033
Is there any more scratching your asshole
and smelling your finger than that?

754
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,664
I do it all the time.

755
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,575
So, that's what I did.
I was in an e-mail fight.

756
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,133
And...

757
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,087
And I looked in the sent folder,
where it's all...

758
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,763
That's it. It's in stone.
You can't change that anymore.

759
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,351
I realized I left something there
by mistake.

760
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,848
I left something at the top of the e-mail
by mistake.

761
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:20,731
And it said, "This is my latest draft.
What do you think?"

762
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:30,112
So, now the rest of it is just shit.

763
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:31,744
It's shit now!

764
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:36,239
'Cause she knows
I have a writing staff and a focus group.

765
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:41,289
There should be credits
at the end of this fucking e-mail.

766
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:45,458
Approved by mother and sister.

767
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:53,760
I don't know.
Love is worth it, though. It really is.

768
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,053
It's worth it. It is.

769
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,596
I mean, I've always been...
I've always pursued love my whole life.

770
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:02,482
Even when I was a kid, I loved girls.
I loved them.

771
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,439
And there was all...

772
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,019
When I was 12, I discovered
that girls are the greatest thing.

773
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:10,816
I would ask them out. That's what I did.
I walked up and asked them out.

774
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:11,783
I had no fear.

775
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:15,111
I'd go up to any girl I liked,
"You want to go out with me?"

776
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,487
And she was like, "No!"

777
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:21,035
You weren't supposed to do that.
You weren't supposed to ask her out.

778
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,200
There was a system.

779
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:24,788
My daughters told me
it still works this way in school.

780
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,213
There's a thing
where the boy asks his friend

781
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:33,009
to ask her friend to ask her

782
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,880
what she would say...

783
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,389
if he asked her out.

784
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,726
How do children just know this...
Elizabethan parlor thing?

785
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,903
Twelve-year-old boy.

786
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:51,401
"Please inquire after her maiden friend.

787
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,948
Were I to request her presence...

788
00:51:58,157 --> 00:52:01,037
what might be her answer?"

789
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:09,712
"Indeed, my lady would enjoy...
your company, sir,

790
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:13,085
were you to make your desires known."

791
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:16,761
"That is well.

792
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,215
May I finger her?"

793
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,978
"You are bold, sir.

794
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,355
And finger her, you may."

795
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,287
"And finger her, I shall."

796
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,368
Anyway,
I didn't do any of that myself.

797
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,707
I just would just ask them out.

798
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,966
They always said no. Girls said no to me.

799
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,844
Until Rachel.

800
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,889
Rachel was the first girl who said yes.

801
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:46,723
I asked her to the dance
in eighth grade, and she said yes.

802
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:51,102
Happiest moment of my life, even to now.

803
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,734
I never beat it.

804
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,444
Anyway, Rachel said,
"Yes, I'll go to the dance with you."

805
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,697
So, we went to the dance.

806
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:02,158
I was 13.
It was my first time with a girl.

807
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,618
About five minutes into the dance,
she comes to me and she says,

808
00:54:05,701 --> 00:54:07,331
"Do you mind if I dance with Jeff?"

809
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,077
I was like, "Okay."

810
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,457
'Cause what other moves did I have...
at 13?

811
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,924
What else are you gonna say?
"Do you mind if I dance with Jeff?"

812
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,469
"Yeah, I do. I mind very much.

813
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,468
What the fuck do you think this is,
Rachel?

814
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,982
You know what? Get your shit.
We're leaving right now.

815
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:32,018
Shut the fuck up, Rachel.
I swear to God."

816
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,020
I didn't have any of those tools.

817
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,935
So, I said, "Okay,"
and she danced with Jeff.

818
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,660
And made out with Jeff and left with Jeff.

819
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,740
That was it.

820
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,115
And I learned...

821
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:50,245
That guy Jeff... this is a true story.

822
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,749
That guy Jeff, he's a woman now.

823
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:54,825
That's what happened.

824
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:55,917
It's true.

825
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:01,417
I was looking up on Facebook people
from my past, and he's a woman.

826
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:04,927
And she has a whole blog on Facebook
about becoming a woman.

827
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:08,467
I was up all night reading it.
I was crying. It was amazing.

828
00:55:08,764 --> 00:55:10,774
I was like, "This is incredible."

829
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,385
And then at the end,
there's a picture of her with hair.

830
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:18,648
And she says, "I didn't change.
I knew what I was all along.

831
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:21,692
I knew I was a girl
since I was 6 years old."

832
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,029
And I read that, and I thought,
"Why did you take my fucking date then?

833
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:31,196
You knew? You piece of shit!
Fuck you, Jeff!

834
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,253
Fuck you and your journey.
I don't give a shit now.

835
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:43,843
Hooray for transgender, but fuck you,
because you're just an asshole.

836
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:47,258
Who became a cunt. That's what happened."

837
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,898
I envy transgender people, though. I do.

838
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,309
It's a tough road,
but I envy them on this level

839
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:03,858
that they figured out what's going on
with them, and they fixed it.

840
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:08,574
What an amazing gift,
to know what the fuck is wrong with you.

841
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,986
Who else gets to have that?

842
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,406
It's just a mushy,
I don't fucking have any idea!

843
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,714
I would give a million dollars
to just wake up,

844
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,421
"Oh, I'm an owl.
That's what the thing is.

845
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,181
I've just got to blink slow
and eat a mouse."

846
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,773
'Cause life is very confusing.

847
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:41,483
Even I'm 49 years old, and I haven't found
a cruising altitude to my identity.

848
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,899
I'm still fucking confused.

849
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:49,407
I get new feelings, and they upset me.
I don't like new feelings.

850
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:52,659
I want to know what I like and get it
and just die.

851
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,583
That's what I want to do at this point.

852
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:58,825
Like I have a weird relationship
with this movie that's on cable sometimes.

853
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:01,915
It's called <i>Magic Mike</i>.
You ever seen this movie? <i>Magic Mike</i>.

854
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,881
For those of you who are watching this
on video many years from now,

855
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,966
<i>Magic Mike</i> was a movie
about male strippers

856
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,764
starring Matthew McConaughey
and Channing Tatum.

857
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:14,135
Whoo!

858
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,812
It was a very different country
when it was made

859
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,313
from whenever you're watching.

860
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,693
But anyway...

861
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,107
We had a whole other thing going on.

862
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:26,815
This building's not here anymore.

863
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:31,986
But...

864
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:36,615
You're watching it on a dusty thing,
and it's all rubble.

865
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,370
And you're watching this.

866
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,035
I don't know why you're watching this
out of everything.

867
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:48,262
But when things were real easy,
we made movies like <i>Magic Mike</i>.

868
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:51,640
It's just a nice movie
about men who strip.

869
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:56,515
And every time I'm flipping around
and it comes on, I always stop.

870
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:01,137
And then I play a little game of chicken
with this movie.

871
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,526
I stop because it's a good movie.
It's well made,

872
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,937
directed by Steven Soderbergh,
good director.

873
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:12,656
And so I get into it, I get into
the story, and then they start stripping.

874
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,450
And then I start having
all these feelings.

875
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,370
My face gets a little hot.

876
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,076
At first, I just get hostile
for no reason.

877
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,294
I just... fucking... fucking...

878
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,722
But then there's one part of the movie
that I like.

879
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:39,386
I have a favorite part... of <i>Magic Mike</i>,
so, I always stick around for that part.

880
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:44,024
It's the part where Matthew McConaughey,
he's wearing leather pants, no shirt.

881
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,024
And he goes,

882
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:47,225
"The law says you cannot touch.

883
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,693
But I think I see a lot
of lawbreakers out there."

884
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,452
Like, just that...

885
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:56,911
It's, like, perfect.

886
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,540
Just the way it rolls out of him.

887
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:02,209
"I think I see a lot
of lawbreakers out there."

888
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,128
I just really like that.

889
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,085
I like it.

890
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:12,973
When the movie comes on, I'm always like,
"Let's get to where he says that."

891
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:16,683
And then he says it, and I'm like,
"Fucking good, that's really good."

892
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,966
I like it a lot.

893
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,847
Here's how much I like it.
I don't do impressions,

894
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:26,444
and I kind of nail that one
because I think about it all the time.

895
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,105
I'm walking around my house, like,

896
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:36,316
"The law says you can't touch.

897
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:41,655
The law says you can't touch."

898
00:59:43,163 --> 00:59:44,663
Then I go up to my dog,

899
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,458
"But I think
I see a lot of lawbreakers right here."

900
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,670
I like that part.

901
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,800
After he says it,
all these strippers come in.

902
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:58,885
Matthew McConaughey
and all these strippers.

903
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,760
Channing Tatum comes out, fucking...

904
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,399
And then I go, like, "Fuck!"
And then I have to stop.

905
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,943
I'm starting to get a feeling.

906
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,320
I'm starting to get, like, a feeling.
It's not a boner.

907
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,414
It's not a boner.

908
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:25,209
But I can feel my dick starting
to turn over a little bit.

909
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,250
Just starting to...

910
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:32,337
You know when you can feel
your dick kind of unfold?

911
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,888
It's like a pool toy
that's been blowing up for a while.

912
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:45,892
The wrinkles are starting
to come out. It's taking shape.

913
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:54,822
Just that early...

914
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:58,409
My dick's just waking up.

915
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,237
What are you guys doing here?

916
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,169
I've never watched the whole movie.

917
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:11,709
I've never seen<i> Magic Mike</i>
in its entirety.

918
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,800
Because I don't wanna see it.
I don't wanna see the end of <i>Magic Mike</i>.

919
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:17,631
I know what the end of <i>Magic Mike</i> is.

920
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:22,296
I'm pretty sure that the end of <i>Magic Mike</i>
is that I'm gay.

921
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,807
I'm pretty sure that's how it ends.

922
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,360
I don't want to see the ending.
I want to stay like this.

923
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:40,743
You know why? 'Cause I'm 49 years old.

924
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,201
I don't want to enter
the gay community now.

925
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:48,498
This is not the version of me
that's gonna have an awesome time

926
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:50,999
as the new gay guy.

927
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:54,543
So, fuck that.

928
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,130
And that's my right, by the way.
Because that's about me.

929
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,838
That is my life.

930
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,715
I'd never discriminate
against another person for being gay.

931
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:07,062
I wouldn't dream of it.
But I have every right to oppress

932
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:12,597
and discriminate against
my own possible budding homosexuality.

933
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:17,477
That's mine to just violently push down.

934
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:24,243
Like it's a dude
I'm trying to make blow me right now.

935
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:36,668
And you know, I haven't become, like,
generally attracted to men.

936
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,343
I'm not sexually attracted to men.

937
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:43,181
Just Matthew McConaughey
and Channing Tatum.

938
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,927
Those two guys? Fuck.

939
01:02:46,221 --> 01:02:49,181
Fuck, seriously.

940
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,349
Matthew, with his, like, leathery skin.

941
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,725
He's like, "Hey..."

942
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:54,975
Just...

943
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,034
Fucking sexy.

944
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:02,702
And Channing, kind of dumb face, like...

945
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:05,235
Like, oh, shit!

946
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,405
Fuck. I like it.

947
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:16,544
But men, in general, I'm not into it.
You know what I think it is?

948
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,496
I'm only gay for the best.

949
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:23,590
I'm top-shelf gay.

950
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,679
I'm not retail gay, you know what I mean?
I'm not off-the-rack gay.

951
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:32,311
I'm not gonna go to JC Penney's
and suck a bunch of dicks.

952
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,517
I'm going to go to Neiman Marcus
and get the signature collection.

953
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:40,317
Platinum dick.

954
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,861
The best.

955
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:44,698
The best dick.

956
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,374
'Cause I'll try the best anything.

957
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,536
If it's the best one, I'll try it.

958
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:53,789
Like, I don't like cognac.

959
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:57,132
I would never buy a bottle of Hennessy
and keep it in my house.

960
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,458
But I've never tried the best cognac.

961
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:03,046
If somebody was like,
"Would you like to try this cognac? It's...

962
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:08,426
This cognac was 500 years old
300 years ago."

963
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,061
Like, "Yeah. Fucking give me that."

964
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:16,135
If somebody asked me
to go to a Kenyan restaurant,

965
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:19,107
I don't want to go to a Kenyan restaurant.
I know all the foods that I like.

966
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:22,776
If somebody was like,
"This is the best Kenyan restaurant.

967
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,109
It takes six months to get a reservation.

968
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,315
I can get you in.

969
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:29,284
They fly live turtles in.

970
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:34,156
And you eat it, you bite off
its screaming face while it's alive.

971
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,383
And every turtle you eat is the last
of his species."

972
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:45,835
I can't wait to eat that fucking turtle.

973
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:49,141
I'm going to end his people with my mouth.

974
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,390
The best, I'll try it.

975
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:56,483
If somebody was like,
"We have a guy here, he has the best dick.

976
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,475
The best dick ever.

977
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:03,693
His dick has been soaking in olive oil
since he was five years old.

978
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:11,783
We've been feeding him nothing
but butter and penises his whole life.

979
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,503
He has the best dick,
and you can suck it right now."

980
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:29,466
"Well, let me see it.

981
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:32,391
Can I see it?

982
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:34,808
Can you take it out?

983
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:39,562
Oh, shit. That's beautiful. Oh, my God.

984
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,976
That's my favorite thing now.
Fuck, I shouldn't have looked at it.

985
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:48,895
Bring it closer. I don't know what I'm
gonna do, but bring it closer, please."

986
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,812
I think, at that point,
you put it in your mouth, right?

987
01:06:18,892 --> 01:06:20,892
If you're looking at the best dick ever,

988
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,607
and you're not sure... you wanna suck it,
just put it in your mouth.

989
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:27,436
And then decide.
Just for like 20 seconds.

990
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:28,605
Whoo!

991
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,532
That's a long time.
That's 20 seconds.

992
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,737
That's a long time
to have a dick in your mouth...

993
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,156
that you're ambivalent about.

994
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,076
It's 20 sec...

995
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:44,674
If you have a dick in your mouth
for 20 seconds, you are not deciding.

996
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,088
Twenty seconds.

997
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:51,381
This is... I'll show you. This is
20 seconds with a dick in your mouth.

998
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,529
No.

999
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,820
No.

1000
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,497
Yeah, I decided not to suck that dick...

1001
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,536
that's been in my mouth all day.

1002
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,962
I don't like dicks.
That's why I'm not gay.

1003
01:07:30,547 --> 01:07:34,877
That really is the reason. I hate dicks.
Penises are very disgusting to me.

1004
01:07:34,968 --> 01:07:37,968
To me. I don't want to yuck your yum.
I just think they're gross.

1005
01:07:39,264 --> 01:07:40,434
I always hated penises.

1006
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,265
I hated my father's penis. I did.

1007
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,557
I did. I hated my father's penis.

1008
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:47,364
When you're a little boy,
you're gonna see your dad's dick.

1009
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,856
If you go to a restaurant,
you're probably gonna see your dad's dick.

1010
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,106
I should explain that, right?

1011
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:58,276
That sounds like I have a weird father.

1012
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,541
"All right, we're going out to eat.
Everybody take a look."

1013
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:12,756
No, sometimes if you go
to a restaurant with your family,

1014
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:16,179
when it's time to pee, you go pee
with your dad if you're a little boy.

1015
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,549
If you go to a ballgame with your dad,
there was...

1016
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:20,926
There were never urinals.
It was just a trough.

1017
01:08:21,723 --> 01:08:24,313
And the little boys and the men
stand there together.

1018
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,604
And the men are just standing there...

1019
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:28,983
And we're down here, the little boys.

1020
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:31,731
And the dicks are eye-level.

1021
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,106
Just horrible, pissing dicks.

1022
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:39,783
In both directions,
like a chorus line, just...

1023
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,416
And my dad had the worst dick.

1024
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:49,631
He had the worst.

1025
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,417
'Cause my dad...
First of all, my father's Mexican.

1026
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,344
It's true. My father is Mexican. I'm not.

1027
01:08:56,758 --> 01:09:00,348
I'm not Mexican. My father is.

1028
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:06,890
Just 'cause some Mexican fucked my mom
for years... doesn't make me a Mexican.

1029
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,555
It just makes her a whore.

1030
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:14,981
But, anyway... my dad...

1031
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:18,815
My father had a Mexican, Catholic,

1032
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:23,912
uncut, raw, organic...

1033
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:29,921
local, fucking free-range Mexican dick.

1034
01:09:30,124 --> 01:09:31,544
It was just so basic.

1035
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:37,046
It was like a farmer's market yam,
just sticking out like a tamarindo pod.

1036
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,755
And the pee would spray out of it.

1037
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:42,722
I'm like, "Dad, open your dick
before you pee out of it."

1038
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,266
It's like you're pissing out
of the corner of a pillowcase.

1039
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,815
And my dad's life is...
My dad's had a weird life.

1040
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,030
Too.

1041
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:12,166
When I was ten years old, my parents got
divorced, and my dad turned into a Jew.

1042
01:10:12,834 --> 01:10:15,254
I mean, he converted...

1043
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,803
to Judaism. He didn't turn into a Jew.

1044
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,587
It's not like my dad was like...

1045
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,274
He...

1046
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,018
converted... to Judaism.

1047
01:10:36,524 --> 01:10:39,034
And I had friends who were Jewish.

1048
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:43,030
And I knew that they had little
clipped dicks, little... little neat...

1049
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,078
And then I remembered
my father's alligator claw of a penis.

1050
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:51,663
I really hate penises.

1051
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:55,498
That's really my problem with being gay.
That's why I'm not gay. Men are fine.

1052
01:10:55,585 --> 01:10:58,045
I'd like to have a boyfriend,
that would be nice.

1053
01:10:58,796 --> 01:11:01,796
I would. Every time I hear somebody say
"my boyfriend,"

1054
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,683
I'm always like, "I want a boyfriend."

1055
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,101
Why can't I have a boyfriend?

1056
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,854
I'd like to have a big, tall boyfriend.

1057
01:11:15,396 --> 01:11:16,516
That's my boyfriend.

1058
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:20,363
I'm mad at my boyfriend.

1059
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:25,778
I get to wear his jacket.
It's all big on me.

1060
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:28,405
I'm like, "This is my boyfriend's jacket.

1061
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,542
I feel safe."

1062
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,538
I know I would like it.

1063
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:39,126
I would like to have a big dude
in my life.

1064
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,673
Comes up behind me like this.
I'm like, "Hi."

1065
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,929
Like, I know that would be nice.

1066
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,974
But in order to get all those parts,

1067
01:11:50,056 --> 01:11:53,016
you have to have a fucking cock
shoved up your asshole.

1068
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,150
Like a hard dick ramming in your...

1069
01:11:56,229 --> 01:11:57,439
Ow!

1070
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,357
"Oh, fuck.

1071
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:00,857
Oh.

1072
01:12:01,317 --> 01:12:03,277
I just wanted to wear your jacket."

1073
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:09,236
Thanks a lot, you guys. You were great.

1074
