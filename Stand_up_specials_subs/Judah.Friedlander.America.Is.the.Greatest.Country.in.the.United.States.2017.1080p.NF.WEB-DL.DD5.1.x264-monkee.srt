1
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,366
I think being an American
is a preexisting condition.

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,133
My hair used to be black.

3
00:00:21,766 --> 00:00:23,800
Now every year white hairs show up.

4
00:00:23,866 --> 00:00:25,900
Next year more white hairs moving in.

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,833
It makes me mad, makes me sad

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,466
'cause it means
my head is getting gentrified.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,766
And...

8
00:00:33,833 --> 00:00:38,700
there is nothing I can do to stop it.
Pretty soon I won't be able to afford it.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,066
But I keep moving forward
because I'm an American.

10
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:50,533
I just wrote a movie about a pi単ata
that comes back to life

11
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,566
and murders all the children
that beat her with a stick.

12
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:57,633
That's right, I said her.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,933
It's pi単ata, not pi単ato. Okay?

14
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:04,833
Pi単atas are females
who have been getting abused by children

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,366
at the encouragement of parents
for centuries.

16
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,533
I like trilogies.

17
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:14,600
That's why I'm so excited
about World War III.

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,200
The original was a landmark.
Everyone loved that one.

19
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:22,566
A lot of critics and fans

20
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:25,600
think the second one
was better than the first, and...

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,833
We've all been waiting over 70 years
for the final chapter in the trilogy.

22
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,033
I wish they would just
give it to us already. I...

23
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:36,333
I think the next one
could be the highest-grossing.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,133
I just hope they don't ruin it
with too much merchandising.

25
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,766
I do a lot of charity work. Anyone else?

26
00:01:50,066 --> 00:01:51,400
You seem like great people.

27
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:57,533
I just donated to this organization,
Doctors Without Passports.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,966
It's a group of doctors who wanna help
sick people in foreign countries

29
00:02:02,033 --> 00:02:04,300
but they're not motivated enough
to get a passport.

30
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,000
Try to chip in and make a difference.

31
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:11,300
I wrote a self-help book for trees.

32
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,600
It's called How Not to Become a Book.

33
00:02:16,966 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm hoping to sell 10 million copies.

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,966
I just made a documentary
about the horrors of human trafficking

35
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,166
during rush hour.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,433
I'm always trying to help people.

37
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:35,000
Anyone from far away? Or, uh...?

38
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
- Where are you from?
- Guatemala.

39
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:38,200
Yeah.

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,200
- Guatemala.
- Guatemala's not that far.

41
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:44,266
I was actually there this morning.
I, uh...

42
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:48,100
I was gonna fly in for the show,
but it was nice out

43
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:50,300
so I parkoured my way over here, and so...

44
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,400
I care about the planet,
I don't use up carbon footprints,

45
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,633
just real footprints.

46
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,466
- What else? Who else?
- Mexico.

47
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:01,400
It's pronounced Mexico, okay.

48
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,533
Mexico.

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,700
- Where in Mexico?
- Monterrey.

50
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,033
Mm-hm. It's Monterrey. Monterrey.

51
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,766
I used to live
in downtown Monterrey, Mexico.

52
00:03:14,866 --> 00:03:16,766
What part? I lived on First Street.

53
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,600
Sorry, it was Uno Street.
It was Uno Street.

54
00:03:20,766 --> 00:03:23,100
The number one street
in Monterrey, Mexico.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,866
That's why it's called Uno Street.
Welcome, great to have you here.

56
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:30,700
- Where you from?
- England.

57
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:33,766
England, at one point,
you used to own the whole world.

58
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,600
What happened?

59
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,700
I don't think you are an evil,
imperialistic nation.

60
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:44,100
I think you were simply a country that was
in search of better-tasting cuisine.

61
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,266
I, uh... I think one day your troops
wandered over to India,

62
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:51,700
took a lunch break, and were like,
"Wow. This curry is just dandy.

63
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,466
Let's take this recipe back to the queen."

64
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,533
Your general said,
"No, this is too good.

65
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,900
We should surround this nation
with our troops

66
00:04:00,066 --> 00:04:02,466
and protect
this chicken tikka masala recipe.

67
00:04:02,566 --> 00:04:04,633
Make sure it stays authentic."

68
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,433
And, England, you used to own us.

69
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,933
Yeah, you did. You used to own us.

70
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,666
And then we defeated you.

71
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,433
Took your language and perfected it.

72
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:21,633
You got nothing left.

73
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,400
Your last piece of dignity,
David Beckham, lives here.

74
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,300
He named his son Brooklyn, it's over.

75
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,733
That's the second
American Revolutionary War,

76
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,900
Beckham naming his son Brooklyn.
The tie is up at seven.

77
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,400
- What do you do, England?
- I organize events.

78
00:04:43,066 --> 00:04:44,533
You organize events.

79
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,633
It sounds like you're a terrorist.

80
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,266
I'm gonna kick your ass
after the show.

81
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,166
- Any other countries?
- Germany.

82
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,100
Where in Germany?

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,533
West Germany.

84
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:05,733
Have you learned the name of the town yet
or...?

85
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,133
Or you know it's in the western part
of your country?

86
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,800
As a German I expect
more precision with your answer.

87
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,866
- Lithuania.
- Lithuania.

88
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,600
Got a zero from the crowd, sir, but I...

89
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:25,866
I think it's one of the top, uh, ten
ex-Soviet countries.

90
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:26,800
I, uh...

91
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,466
Welcome.
What do you do for a living?

92
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,900
- Student.
- Student?

93
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,733
You get paid to go to school?
Okay. What do you study?

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,733
- Physical education.
- Physical education.

95
00:05:40,366 --> 00:05:42,500
You study physical education.

96
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:46,200
So, when kids are in gym class,

97
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:50,600
you're looking through the window
and taking notes?

98
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,966
That's a crime in this country.

99
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,700
Well, all of you, uh,
Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina,

100
00:06:08,766 --> 00:06:13,300
Germany, Ireland, Australia,
Netherlands, Switzerland,

101
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,600
all of you,
welcome to the number one country.

102
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,533
Welcome.

103
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:19,733
Thank you for coming all the way

104
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,700
from your little amateur,
junior varsity country

105
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:28,200
to an actual real, professional
and number one country.

106
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,933
Netherlands, beautiful country.

107
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,166
Most indecisive country in the world.

108
00:06:34,766 --> 00:06:37,166
You're the Netherlands,
you're also Holland.

109
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,733
And when you meet someone
you tell them to call you Dutch.

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,233
You've been a country a long time now,
pick a fucking name.

111
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,400
Healthiest country in the world.

112
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:53,300
Everyone bicycles every day
in the Netherlands.

113
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,866
Yet they've never won the Tour de France.

114
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Sad, dude.

115
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,266
Twice.

116
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,600
Switzer... No. That's a Dutch myth.

117
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,966
Yeah, that actually never happened.

118
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:16,133
Netherlands, what's your rank worldwide?
What do you guys rank?

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,366
We're number one,
but what do you guys rank?

120
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,333
Last time I checked the charts,
I didn't see you guys on it.

121
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,266
I know you're one of
the top 30 countries in Europe,

122
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:30,000
but, you know, like worldwide,
what's the rank?

123
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,533
You don't know? Let's go to the stats.

124
00:07:32,633 --> 00:07:34,866
All right, Netherlands, uh,
how many, uh...?

125
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:37,166
How many gun murders a year do you have?

126
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,266
Like three? Four?

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,300
We have 30,000.

128
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,266
And you know why?
'Cause we're number one.

129
00:07:48,866 --> 00:07:53,233
And think about it, why does America
have so many more gun murders

130
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:57,366
than the Netherlands?
It's because our country has superior aim.

131
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,366
We're...

132
00:07:59,533 --> 00:08:00,866
We're better marksmen.

133
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,866
You all have no hand-eye coordination.
That's...

134
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,866
That's why you're playing soccer.
That's why you never won the World Series.

135
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,700
Netherlands, another question. Um...

136
00:08:14,033 --> 00:08:16,900
When a woman in Netherlands
gives birth to a baby,

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,100
how much time is she given off of work

138
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,666
and maybe even paid
for that time off of work?

139
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,666
One year.

140
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:27,866
Women in Netherlands are given
a year of paid leave after giving birth.

141
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,933
Know how much time
women in America are given off of work

142
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:32,833
after they give birth to a baby?

143
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,000
Zero.

144
00:08:35,033 --> 00:08:35,933
And you know why?

145
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,566
It's because our women
care about the economy.

146
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,566
That's why the euro is going down.

147
00:08:46,033 --> 00:08:46,866
Number one.

148
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,900
Netherlands, another question. Um...

149
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,933
How many people imprisoned
in the Netherlands?

150
00:08:55,666 --> 00:08:58,366
I don't mean emotionally, but literally,

151
00:08:58,433 --> 00:09:00,600
how many people imprisoned
in the Netherlands?

152
00:09:01,233 --> 00:09:04,366
- We close down prisons.
- You close down your prisons? No.

153
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,500
No one has the courage to steal?

154
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,300
Just sad, dude.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,133
Just sad, dude.

156
00:09:12,933 --> 00:09:15,366
You probably have about 350 people
in prison.

157
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:19,366
We have 2.6 million people in prison
in this country.

158
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,600
That means we have a government
that cares so much about its citizens

159
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:26,933
it awards 2.6 million of them
free meals and housing.

160
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,666
And some of them are given
a lifetime supply.

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,800
And they cannot say no.

162
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,300
It's a mandatory gesture
of unconditional love.

163
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:39,233
I'm sorry your government hates you.

164
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:43,500
We have 2.6 million people in prison
in this country.

165
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:48,366
Kim Kardashian has 50.7 million followers
on Twitter.

166
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,733
We are incarcerating the wrong people.

167
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,500
That's the way I see it.

168
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,866
I was just in Italy.
Have you been there?

169
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,266
- Did you like it?
- Yes.

170
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:05,933
Really? I was not impressed.

171
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,866
I traveled all over Italy,

172
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:11,933
not one Olive Garden
in the entire country.

173
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,800
All these tiny Italian restaurants
that nobody's ever even heard of before,

174
00:10:17,066 --> 00:10:19,966
not one good enough
to warrant opening a second one

175
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:24,266
and starting a chain.
Just failing across the entire country.

176
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:25,800
Sad, but...

177
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:33,233
We even have the greatest Irish restaurant
in the world, McDonald's.

178
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,300
That's why the Irish have been moving here
for decades.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,466
Now, where do you guys stand
on professional sports teams

180
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:44,166
using racist mascots?

181
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,266
I'm against it.

182
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,600
But what about McDonald's
and their mascot?

183
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:54,566
Now, like I said, McDonald's,
greatest Irish restaurant,

184
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:59,100
and the Irish are known for often having
fair skin and reddish hair.

185
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:04,700
And you look at the McDonald's mascot,
it's literally a fucking clown.

186
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:09,233
A painted white face,
blood-red hair and nose.

187
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:12,933
How is that not offensive to our friends
in the Irish community?

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,800
Why are they not marching and protest...?
I think they must be too drunk to notice.

189
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:21,866
I can't think of one reason
they're not sticking up for themselves.

190
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:28,200
Question for the Europeans in the crowd.

191
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:29,966
How come when you go to Europe

192
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:34,566
nobody ever really tips the, uh, waiters
and the waitresses at a restaurant?

193
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,233
- They have better minimum wage.
- No, sir.

194
00:11:38,666 --> 00:11:41,300
It's because they have inferior
waiters and waitresses.

195
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:48,366
America has the most elite waitstaff
on the planet.

196
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:51,833
Plus we're just a more generous country.

197
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:53,733
We're givers.

198
00:11:54,966 --> 00:11:58,500
That's why we have military bases
in over 80 different countries.

199
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:00,266
We care.

200
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:04,066
America has military bases in Europe,

201
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,900
Europe has zero military bases in America.

202
00:12:07,133 --> 00:12:09,200
Why? Because they're fucking selfish.

203
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:14,366
And we have the best drones in the world.

204
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,566
Drones are designed
to do a surgical strike,

205
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,533
to take out one person at a time.

206
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,766
Ours often kill up to 20 or 25 people
at a time.

207
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,600
That's an overachieving victory drone.

208
00:12:26,766 --> 00:12:29,600
Now, I'm against the military
using drone strikes

209
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,133
because it takes away American jobs.

210
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,400
And...

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,366
Now, outside the military,
drones are starting to deliver packages.

212
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,066
That takes jobs away from birds.

213
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,866
This country used to have carrier pigeons,
and now they are all out of work.

214
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,400
That's the real reason
we have Angry Birds.

215
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,666
We're the fattest country
in the world.

216
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:04,600
Another reason we're number one,
and we keep getting fatter.

217
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:08,000
Why? Because the galaxy is expanding.

218
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,833
We're the only country adapting to it.
European countries, you're too healthy.

219
00:13:13,933 --> 00:13:17,766
Pretty soon you're gonna lose your gravity
and float in outer space,

220
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,666
and then we will wobble over
and take your land.

221
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,666
That's why California gets
those earthquakes.

222
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:29,300
Too many skinny people,
not heavy enough to hold that earth down.

223
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:34,966
The Midwest, no earthquakes
because people are fucking solid.

224
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,133
I teach science part-time online
at Dunkin' Donuts Academy.

225
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,666
You guys should definitely take
one of my courses.

226
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:49,700
We're number one in type 2 diabetes.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,066
- Any other countries?
- Canada.

228
00:13:58,133 --> 00:13:59,666
- Where?
- Canada.

229
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:02,433
Why did you say that? We were
having a good time without...

230
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:08,000
We're all here having fun
and you had to say Canada.

231
00:14:10,366 --> 00:14:13,833
Canada, do you realize we could've
invaded you at any point in history?

232
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,533
We were just never interested.

233
00:14:19,266 --> 00:14:22,166
We actually marched
all the way through your country,

234
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,033
skipped it, then took Alaska.

235
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
Like, "You want this?" "No."

236
00:14:28,066 --> 00:14:30,366
"What about this here?"
"Not feeling it."

237
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,433
"Oh, look, Alaska. We'll take that."

238
00:14:33,566 --> 00:14:37,366
Canada, in the War of 1812,
you burned down the White House

239
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,366
and we still did not invade you.

240
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:42,633
Because we came to the realization

241
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,366
that living in Canada
was punishment enough.

242
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:51,366
So polite, Canada, so polite.

243
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,633
I was just on Canadian Tinder.

244
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,500
It was, uh...

245
00:14:55,566 --> 00:14:58,533
There was no swipe left,
only swipe rights. Just...

246
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,833
Too polite to say no to anybody.

247
00:15:01,933 --> 00:15:07,133
Said, "Well, not my type, but who knows,
it could work out. It could work out."

248
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,766
- A lot of Canadians hate America.
- No.

249
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,200
No, you do, but you don't admit it
because you're too polite and nice.

250
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,800
- That's true!
- And you hate us

251
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,700
because you think we hate you.

252
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:24,833
But we don't hate you,
we just don't notice you.

253
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,933
Canada is like,
"America, show us some love.

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,300
We're Canada, we have free healthcare,
no violence." We're like, "We're busy."

255
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:38,500
You see, America, we're the
cheerleaders and the quarterbacks.

256
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,466
And Canada is like the nerdy kid
who just moved here

257
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,000
even though he's been here
the whole fucking time.

258
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:49,766
Understand what I'm saying?
Canada gets American news.

259
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,600
America does not get Canadian news

260
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,766
unless it's a story
about a crackhead mayor

261
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,633
acting like a stupid American.

262
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:03,333
See, Canada,
when you're better than us, we ignore you.

263
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
When you dumb it down,
we wanna hang out.

264
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:11,700
This will sum up the entire
Canadian-American dynamic.

265
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,066
As an American, you go to Canada,

266
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:16,300
you don't have to switch
American money

267
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:19,866
over to Canadian money.
That's how friendly and polite they are.

268
00:16:19,966 --> 00:16:22,966
They save you that hassle
of going to the exchange place

269
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,400
just so that you,
a foreigner in their land,

270
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,200
can have more free time.

271
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,266
Very nice.

272
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
If a Canadian comes to America

273
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,700
and tries to put one little shiny,
sparkly Canadian quarter

274
00:16:37,033 --> 00:16:40,033
into some dirty slot
in an American parking meter,

275
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,633
we're like,
"Get that fucking shit out of here."

276
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,533
That's the relationship.

277
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:51,266
And as a result,
Canada has low self-esteem.

278
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,133
And there is proof in your money.

279
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:57,666
Who is printed on American money?

280
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:00,366
American presidents for the most part.

281
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,066
And who is printed
on a lot of Canadian money?

282
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:04,633
The Queen of England.

283
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:09,066
How do you think that makes
the Queen of Canada feel?

284
00:17:10,966 --> 00:17:13,900
Dear Canada,
before you want America to love you,

285
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,366
learn to love yourself.

286
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,200
We're just a better country, Canada.

287
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:25,599
You have red and white in your flag.
We have red, white, and blue on our flag.

288
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:29,900
That's why we're number one.
We've got red, white, and blue in our flag

289
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,900
just like Cuba and North Korea.

290
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:35,600
We're a flawless nation.

291
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,533
America is the greatest country
in the United States.

292
00:17:41,433 --> 00:17:43,033
You cannot argue that.

293
00:17:45,033 --> 00:17:49,833
How does it feel being in Canada,
living so close to greatness?

294
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,966
Yet so far away at the same time.

295
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:54,666
It feels awesome.

296
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,433
Way too much energy for Canada.

297
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:03,666
Way too much energy.

298
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,833
Israel.

299
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,633
- Where?
- Israel.

300
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,266
Cool. Where in Palestine are you from?

301
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,133
- Any other countries?
- Israel.

302
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,000
- Where?
- Here, Israel.

303
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
- Where in Israel?
- Right here.

304
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,466
Yeah, yeah. Yeah... I ju...

305
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,000
This is not Israel here, so...

306
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,833
I'm from right here in Israel.

307
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,700
Wow, no wonder why there's
so much conflict with Palestine.

308
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,766
Like everywhere we go is Israel.
Doesn't matter. If, uh...

309
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,933
we built settlements down here,
yeah, that's Israel.

310
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:50,833
We take a plane to New York,
that's Israel, too.

311
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:54,966
Okay? Wherever we go,
it's fucking Israel, okay?

312
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,233
So, you're from Israel? Cool.

313
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,166
You're Asian.

314
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,366
Yes, you are. You're Asian.

315
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:10,166
Israel is in Asia.

316
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:12,700
It's not in Africa.

317
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,100
It's not in Europe.

318
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,533
The Mideast is not a continent.

319
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,533
You're Asian.

320
00:19:21,766 --> 00:19:23,833
Jesus was Asian.

321
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,666
Santa Claus is Asian.

322
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,833
That's why all the toys say
"made in China."

323
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,066
I was just in China, met a 5-year-old boy.

324
00:19:38,733 --> 00:19:40,900
His toy said, "I made this."

325
00:19:45,566 --> 00:19:46,533
I like China.

326
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,000
China has my favorite air quality.

327
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:54,700
I don't trust the air in America.
I don't trust what I can't see.

328
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,900
In China, you can see it. I trust that.

329
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:00,500
It's honest air.

330
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:03,766
Without transparency,
they achieve transparency.

331
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,000
You're from Israel,
what should happen?

332
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:11,966
Should Israel have a two-state solution?
A one-state solution?

333
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:14,366
Or just a free-for-all?
What should happen?

334
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:17,400
- I'm gunning for the two states.
- The two-state? Okay.

335
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,900
So, you're thinking maybe you should do
what we did in our country with Carolina?

336
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:30,766
For centuries it was just Carolina, and...

337
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,000
they were always at war with each other.
North...

338
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,066
The north part of Carolina was building
settlements in the southern parts

339
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,166
and making life
very, very difficult for them.

340
00:20:41,233 --> 00:20:44,100
They would sometimes throw rocks
back at them, and...

341
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,566
And then we split them up
into two completely separate states.

342
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:49,166
North and South Carolina.

343
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:53,033
And now they are the two
most shining examples

344
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,466
of perfect states in our country.

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,233
North Carolina and South Carolina
have had zero problems

346
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:04,100
and are the best states in the nation
since we did that, so...

347
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:07,266
I don't know, maybe you're right,
or maybe not.

348
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,233
Uh...

349
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,133
How about you? What do you do?
You look like you teach chess to cops.

350
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,100
Smart but solid.

351
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,066
Sounds good to me.

352
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:22,400
- Yeah? Where is home? Australia?
- Yeah.

353
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:23,900
- What part?
- Melbourne.

354
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,566
It's pronounced Melbourne.
Yeah, it's Melbourne.

355
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:31,766
You almost got it. You almost got it.

356
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,033
Melbourne.

357
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:39,900
M-E-L-B-O-U-R-N-E. Melbourne.

358
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,933
Australians are always mispronouncing
their own names.

359
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:47,333
They don't say Melbourne,
they say Melbourne.

360
00:21:47,433 --> 00:21:51,800
They don't say Perth, they say Perth.
And it has nothing to do with your accent.

361
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,966
I mean, as a country,
you're acist against the letter R.

362
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:59,400
I think the actual name of your country
is Raustralia.

363
00:22:00,733 --> 00:22:03,733
But you efused to say R
more than one time in a word.

364
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,233
Australia, you're a lot like America.

365
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,133
But you're a lot behind us.

366
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,300
You're a lot younger than us.
You're a big country like us,

367
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:15,700
but you've only got cities
along the coast.

368
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,666
You've got nothing in the middle.
Here in America,

369
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:21,966
we've got cities along the coast
and throughout the middle.

370
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,233
Except nobody wants to visit
the cities in the middle.

371
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,733
So, even though you're behind,
you're actually ahead.

372
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,833
Well done, Raustralia.

373
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:40,633
Now, ahem... Australia, why are you
so far away from the rest of the world?

374
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
What's up with that?

375
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:43,900
I think it's because you're scared.

376
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,233
Of every country.

377
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,866
Except New Zealand,
the Canada of Australia.

378
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,700
- Okay, where you from?
- Denmark.

379
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,133
Denmark, very nice, too.

380
00:22:59,733 --> 00:23:03,066
That's Scandinavia.
Beautiful part of the world.

381
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:06,066
Interesting part of the world,
Scandinavia.

382
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:10,733
Almost all white people...
yet still segregated.

383
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:15,533
The popular people are in Sweden,
the rich people in Norway,

384
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,400
artsy people in Denmark,

385
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,166
and the depressed nerds
with zero self-esteem

386
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,533
waiting to kill themselves
are in Finland.

387
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,066
And...

388
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,033
the people you do not even acknowledge
are in Iceland.

389
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,900
So, it's interesting
how you work out these things.

390
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,433
Is anyone from another, uh, state?
Anyone from another state?

391
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,466
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

392
00:23:36,566 --> 00:23:39,700
Chicago.
Correct answer would've been Illinois.

393
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:47,366
See? That's Americans right there.

394
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,200
We're dumb, but we're confident.

395
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:55,700
One of the many reasons we're number one.

396
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,600
- Where did you grow up?
- Spain.

397
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:02,600
- Where?
- From Spain.

398
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:03,800
It's pronounced Espa単a.

399
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:04,800
Espa単a.

400
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:12,366
Why do you change the name of your country
when you go to other countries?

401
00:24:12,466 --> 00:24:14,500
- You call it Espa単a?
- Sure.

402
00:24:15,266 --> 00:24:19,100
Sure? You're just agreeing with me now?
Or like is that the answer?

403
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:21,933
- Seriously.
- Okay.

404
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,333
Then you should call it that in...
Wherever you go.

405
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:28,500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

406
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:33,233
When someone from the United States
goes to Spain

407
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,266
they don't say
they're from Estados Unidos.

408
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:42,833
They get it wrong in a different way.
They say they're from the States.

409
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:45,433
But no one ever here,

410
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:49,333
if someone asked if they're from here,
say they're from the States.

411
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:52,833
If you're already here
and you say you're from the States,

412
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:55,333
they will think
you're not fucking from here.

413
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:04,500
I met some people a few weeks ago
and I asked them where they were from

414
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,666
and they said South Korea.

415
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,033
I'm like, "No, just say Korea."

416
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,833
'Cause when you say South Korea

417
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,300
it sounds like you're North Korean
pretending to be South Korean.

418
00:25:17,233 --> 00:25:20,900
If you're here
and you're from one of the Koreas,

419
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:23,200
we know it's South Korea.

420
00:25:30,533 --> 00:25:34,166
What's the lamest state in the country?
What's the lamest state?

421
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,833
- Utah.
- No, no, no.

422
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,100
- Delaware.
- No.

423
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,166
- Delaware.
- No.

424
00:25:38,233 --> 00:25:41,233
- New Jersey.
- All inferior states, yes,

425
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:42,933
but not the lamest.

426
00:25:43,033 --> 00:25:45,900
The lamest? Washington state.

427
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,366
It's the only state that has to specify
that they're a state.

428
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,533
Because if you just say Washington,
you think Washington, D.C.

429
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,900
Which is not even a state.

430
00:26:02,466 --> 00:26:05,166
You don't say, "Where you from?"
"Virginia state."

431
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:06,166
Yeah... No.

432
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:08,600
But Washington state you say.

433
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,400
How about this table,
where are you from?

434
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,466
- New York.
- New York, that's here, sir.

435
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,566
Sir, let me explain something.
You ask someone where they're from

436
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:21,600
and they say the name of the city
you're currently at,

437
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:24,266
it implies you don't know
where the fuck you are, okay?

438
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:28,366
- Where in New York do you live?
- Tribeca.

439
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,666
Tribeca.
It's a very dangerous neighborhood.

440
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:34,866
Look at someone the wrong way
on the streets of Tribeca,

441
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:36,966
they might unfollow you on Instagram.

442
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:41,100
Tribeca is one of
the most diverse neighborhoods

443
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:42,266
in New York City.

444
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:45,666
Where else can you find hedge fund CEOs

445
00:26:45,766 --> 00:26:48,500
living right next door
to venture capitalists?

446
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,433
Both upstairs from a CVS
that's inside of a Walgreens.

447
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,133
Which are both inside a Citibank.

448
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,433
Where else can you find that

449
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,533
but the melting pot that is New York City?

450
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,966
Our slogan is "Welcome to New York."

451
00:27:08,866 --> 00:27:12,700
We are the only city whose slogan
is sarcastic.

452
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:16,466
Like, "What is this shit?

453
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,700
The ATM just took an additional $60
out of my account.

454
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:23,300
Holy fuck, where's my phone?"
Welcome to New York.

455
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:27,500
Our slogan is "go fuck yourself."

456
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,166
A lot of the new kids moving here
do not know that.

457
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:36,033
They listen to Taylor Swift sing a song
called "Welcome to New York."

458
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,166
And when she sings it, she means it.

459
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:39,500
That's not right.

460
00:27:40,466 --> 00:27:43,566
I'm trying to tell you
if you're walking around the city,

461
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:46,466
and you happen to see Taylor Swift,
rob her.

462
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:50,800
So that she can learn
what her own song means.

463
00:27:51,233 --> 00:27:53,066
'Cause she doesn't fucking know.

464
00:27:56,066 --> 00:28:00,133
The new regime wants to bring back
the policing tactic of stop-and-frisk.

465
00:28:00,233 --> 00:28:02,600
What do you guys think about that?

466
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:03,766
I'm against it.

467
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:08,433
Stop-and-frisk was proven
to be unconstitutional and ineffective.

468
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:13,233
Studies show that 90 percent of the people
who were stopped and frisked by police

469
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,866
were black and Latino men.

470
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:19,200
And 95 percent of the time they were
stopped and frisked, they were innocent.

471
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:22,266
There was no reason for them
to be stopped and frisked,

472
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,500
yet they were stopped and frisked.

473
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:26,266
So, what does that mean?

474
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:27,800
Cops are gay.

475
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,066
Cops are gay.

476
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:33,133
And they prefer black and Latino men

477
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,000
90 percent over all other men.

478
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,566
And I think that is discriminatory
towards other men

479
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,700
who want to be molested and squeezed
by sweaty cops.

480
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:48,766
That's my stance.

481
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:55,266
A friend of mine just went
to a pro-police brutality rally,

482
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:58,400
and the cops
beat the shit out of him, they...

483
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:03,000
Be very careful what protests you go to.

484
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,166
Protesting, one of the most
important things you can do,

485
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:09,300
just double-check which one of these
you're going to.

486
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,666
If you're transgender

487
00:29:14,766 --> 00:29:18,766
you should be able to go to whatever
bathroom you think you should go to.

488
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:22,666
I don't know what the deal
about that is.

489
00:29:22,766 --> 00:29:26,100
I think we all grew up in households
with unsegregated bathrooms.

490
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,666
It's not until we ventured out
in the public

491
00:29:30,766 --> 00:29:32,766
they started segregating bathrooms.

492
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:35,366
And I think even more importantly,
as a nation,

493
00:29:35,466 --> 00:29:39,000
we need to start shitting outside
again and marking our territory

494
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,933
and taking this country back
from the other animals.

495
00:29:42,566 --> 00:29:45,100
- Yeah.
- Other animals try to infiltrate us.

496
00:29:45,166 --> 00:29:48,600
Look at dogs, they're wearing clothes now
trying to be like us.

497
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,266
We've gotta stamp this out
before it's too big of a problem.

498
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:56,500
I think God is fake news.

499
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,100
No, not your God.
I'm talking about that other God.

500
00:30:05,466 --> 00:30:08,966
People are freaking out about fake news
like it's something new.

501
00:30:09,066 --> 00:30:11,766
What about the horoscope section
in the newspaper?

502
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:16,700
That's been fake news for at least
a couple of months at this point, right?

503
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,100
Kale is delicious.

504
00:30:20,366 --> 00:30:22,066
Fake news. That's fake news.

505
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:23,666
It's fake news.

506
00:30:27,366 --> 00:30:31,166
I think O.J. Simpson... is innocent.

507
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
I saw the trial, he was in court.

508
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:38,200
They put a glove recovered
from the murder scene,

509
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,000
tried to put it on his hand,
his hand was too big.

510
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,500
The glove did not fit.

511
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,766
Donald Trump has very small hands.

512
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:53,500
Donald Trump framed O.J. Simpson

513
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,066
for the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ron Goldman.

514
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,633
Trump is a career racist.

515
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,266
At the time, O.J.,

516
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:06,633
one of the most popular black men
in America.

517
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,366
It's a closed case.

518
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,666
And if you disagree with me,
you're fucking racist.

519
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,400
Well, they say love wins.

520
00:31:23,333 --> 00:31:25,533
I think hate
has a pretty strong track record.

521
00:31:31,033 --> 00:31:32,833
- Do you think love wins?
- No.

522
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,733
- No.
- No.

523
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:34,733
No, it doesn't.

524
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,666
Because love is not a competition.

525
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
If you view love as something
about winning or losing,

526
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,000
you don't know what love is about.

527
00:31:43,766 --> 00:31:46,233
Sometimes I get deep.
You gotta be fucking ready for it.

528
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,166
I think Trump
was an excellent candidate for hate.

529
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:54,566
I think Bernie
was a good candidate for love.

530
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:57,000
I think Hillary was neither.

531
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,233
So, love never even got to the finals.

532
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:07,566
Well, who is ready to join the rebellion
and fight for democracy?

533
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,000
That'll do it. Yeah.

534
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:19,500
That was just the energy level
necessary to overthrow a dictatorship.

535
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,433
I...

536
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:23,933
I think some of that energy
and a couple of new apps,

537
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
and, uh, we'll be just fine.

538
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,466
Apps make the world go around.

539
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,433
Always remember
it was the, uh, Voting Rights app of 1965

540
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,233
that got black Americans
the voter protection they needed.

541
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,333
And it was not until the great
ice bucket challenge of 1920

542
00:32:43,433 --> 00:32:45,966
that women got the right to vote.

543
00:32:46,066 --> 00:32:47,300
Once that went viral,

544
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,833
things worked out perfectly
for women forever without a glitch.

545
00:32:53,133 --> 00:32:55,100
Think we should have had a recount?

546
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,266
- Yeah.
- Yes.

547
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,700
I don't think
we should have had a recount.

548
00:32:58,766 --> 00:33:04,466
Because I think as a nation
one of our strong points is not math.

549
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,500
Well, it's official,

550
00:33:10,566 --> 00:33:15,700
Donald Trump is the 45th
greatest president of the United States.

551
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,633
I...

552
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:22,366
I just can't believe that Donald Trump
is now living in government housing.

553
00:33:22,466 --> 00:33:26,166
You know, he has fallen off so hard.

554
00:33:26,266 --> 00:33:29,166
He used to be at the top,
now he is in the projects.

555
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:32,133
He is in the White House.

556
00:33:32,866 --> 00:33:36,566
Fifty bucks says in six months
he tries to flip it, sell it for a profit.

557
00:33:39,033 --> 00:33:40,633
If Trump had any balls

558
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,366
he'd do his next press conference in
fluent Russian just to fuck with people.

559
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,533
I did not vote for Donald Trump.

560
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,700
I wrote in Eric Trump.

561
00:33:57,533 --> 00:33:59,133
I just think he's so cool.

562
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:06,033
Eric Trump always looks like
he just realized he lost his keys.

563
00:34:09,866 --> 00:34:14,133
He always looks like he just found out
someone else is sleeping with his wife,

564
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,400
and it's his dad.

565
00:34:18,366 --> 00:34:21,533
He can't do anything about it
'cause it's also his boss.

566
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:28,266
We live in an oligarchy,

567
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:31,533
but with, uh, humidity
it feels like a dictatorship.

568
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:46,766
I don't think the mother of all bombs
did a good job raising her kids.

569
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:55,066
I think Mike Pence thinks
being gay is a choice

570
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,266
because he made a choice to be straight.

571
00:35:06,766 --> 00:35:10,600
Mike Pence was just in Korea,
near the DMZ.

572
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:11,900
He made a speech

573
00:35:11,966 --> 00:35:17,433
and he said
the era of strategic patience is over.

574
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,466
So, I guess he's coming out of the closet
any second now.

575
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,333
I'm against North Korea
using nuclear weapons.

576
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,666
Because that is cultural appropriation
of the United States,

577
00:35:36,766 --> 00:35:40,033
and that is not okay.

578
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,166
I think I'm gonna have to be
the next president.

579
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,766
Yup, 2017, that's my year.

580
00:35:50,033 --> 00:35:52,533
Not waiting until 2020. 2017.

581
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,300
I'm challenging Trump tomorrow,
three o'clock, White House parking lot.

582
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:01,400
I'll be like, "Let's go, Trump.
One-on-one for the presidency.

583
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,900
Oh. You wanna wait three years?
Are you scared?

584
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,400
Let's fucking go now."
I'll take him down in the first debate.

585
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,066
I'll be like,
"Yeah, Trump, I've got a question.

586
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:15,400
How can you look at your two sons,
Donald and Eric, and still be pro-life?

587
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,400
How can you do that?

588
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,666
You have two minutes
to answer the question.

589
00:36:19,733 --> 00:36:21,600
One minute for each son. Done."

590
00:36:22,966 --> 00:36:25,766
He does have a big following,
but I will defeat him.

591
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,600
He's got some of the Republican vote,
some of the Democrat vote,

592
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:33,466
some of the antiestablishment vote,
he's got the racism vote,

593
00:36:33,533 --> 00:36:35,333
he's got the sexism vote,

594
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,966
and now with the support
of Chris Christie and Ben Carson,

595
00:36:39,033 --> 00:36:41,033
he has the sleep apnea vote as well.

596
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:44,000
But I will defeat him.

597
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,233
Any questions about my
presidential platform for 2017?

598
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,966
Any issues close to your heart
you would like me to address?

599
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,100
Nothing? You lead privileged lives.

600
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,333
There's not one issue
you're concerned about?

601
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,600
Global warming.

602
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,833
Everybody's gotta start
taking off their clothes.

603
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,533
It's getting hot,

604
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:10,300
it's time everybody starts appreciating
each other's bodies.

605
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:13,266
Solid question.

606
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,966
- Yes. Over here.
- Healthcare.

607
00:37:20,066 --> 00:37:22,733
Healthcare? We don't need it.
We're Americans, we're strong.

608
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,633
Europeans need it because they're
inferior and they have no confidence.

609
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,666
When I'm president
I say everyone gets healthcare.

610
00:37:35,433 --> 00:37:37,900
Except the insurance companies.
Fuck them.

611
00:37:39,266 --> 00:37:42,266
We kill them off first
then we can really change lives.

612
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,466
A lot of European countries
look down on America

613
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:50,033
'cause they have healthcare, and we don't.
But at least we have air conditioning.

614
00:37:51,966 --> 00:37:54,266
Air conditioning is illegal in Europe.

615
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,333
At least in America,
we can get a fatal disease

616
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:01,300
and have the dignity of rotting
in a cooled-down apartment.

617
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:07,833
Instead of being stuck
all healthy and sweaty in Belgium,

618
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,333
or as I call it, the Delaware of Europe.

619
00:38:13,133 --> 00:38:14,900
No one has been to Delaware.

620
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,466
See? No one has been to Delaware.

621
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:23,166
Maybe you drove through it
accidentally

622
00:38:23,233 --> 00:38:25,133
and you were like,
"What the fuck is this?"

623
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,333
Then you said,
"Oh, it's the first state?

624
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,233
I guess we've made a lot of
improvements since then.

625
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,700
Let's try to forget this shit
ever happened."

626
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:41,900
When I'm president
I'm gonna make Puerto Rico the 50th state.

627
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,133
I'm demoting Delaware.

628
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,600
It's our first state,
we've yet to be impressed.

629
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:51,300
Puerto Rico is getting a shot.

630
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,000
International policies.

631
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,933
Foreign policy step one,
invade North Dakota.

632
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,466
Send North Korea a message.

633
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,600
Strategy, strategy.

634
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,733
Foreign policy step two,
invade Switzerland.

635
00:39:15,666 --> 00:39:18,666
That's what they get
for being neutral all these years.

636
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:21,966
When you are silent,
you side with the oppressors.

637
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,933
How will we defeat them?

638
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:26,933
By using their own Swiss army knives
against them.

639
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:31,300
We'll poke them with that,
cut them up with those little scissors.

640
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,266
We will defeat them physically
and psychologically.

641
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,800
And it will not cost us a dime

642
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,533
because we will use
their Swiss army knives.

643
00:39:41,566 --> 00:39:45,966
Foreign policy step three,
unblur Japanese porn.

644
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,766
Hear me out.
It's more complicated than you think.

645
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:56,400
It goes back all the way to World War II
where there were a lot of atrocities.

646
00:39:56,733 --> 00:39:59,866
One of them,
we dropped two nuclear bombs on Japan

647
00:40:00,166 --> 00:40:04,066
killing thousands and thousands,
devastating their country for decades.

648
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:08,600
Thirty-five years later,
Japan blurred the genitals in their porn.

649
00:40:09,933 --> 00:40:11,966
Victory: Japan.

650
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,066
It's time for a truce.

651
00:40:21,866 --> 00:40:24,733
Let me ask you a question.
Do you like Hawaii?

652
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,600
- Never been.
- Okay.

653
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,433
Well, as president I'm gonna move it
to Lake Michigan.

654
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,066
Hawaii is beautiful, it is too far away.

655
00:40:36,866 --> 00:40:38,233
Move it to Lake Michigan,

656
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,200
it's a five-minute canoe ride
from downtown Chicago.

657
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:44,233
Easier for the entire country to visit.

658
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:46,466
Do you all like California?

659
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:47,766
Yeah!

660
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,100
Do you like New York?

661
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,300
Both cool, again too far away.

662
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,933
I have a solution.
California here, New York here.

663
00:40:56,433 --> 00:41:01,433
We take the bulk of the Midwest
and we move it above Canada.

664
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,333
New York and California
come closer together.

665
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:10,733
You can now take the E train
from the Empire State Building

666
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,000
to In-N-Out Burger in 23 minutes.

667
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,100
By moving all of that land around,

668
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:22,166
that's gonna create jobs.

669
00:41:22,433 --> 00:41:23,366
Yeah!

670
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,233
Economy thing.

671
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:30,733
I'll solve the homeless crisis
in this country.

672
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,300
A lot of homeless in this country.

673
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:36,500
And what else do we have a lot of
in this country? Cars.

674
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:39,533
Right? Young man, what do cars run on?

675
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,133
Gas.

676
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,300
No, roads actually, sir. Roads.

677
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:45,733
Cars run on roads.

678
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,000
And what do some roads have? Tollbooths.

679
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
Little houses.

680
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,866
We make the homeless full-time,
live-in tollbooth operators.

681
00:41:56,633 --> 00:41:59,933
They're already good at asking for change.
It's a perfect fit.

682
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:02,566
It's a perfect fit.

683
00:42:03,533 --> 00:42:07,433
I just solved the homeless crisis
in America.

684
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,433
I think the term homeless
can be derogatory.

685
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,866
At the beginning of time,
everyone was homeless.

686
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:19,800
So, I prefer the term old-fashioned.

687
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,666
- Any other issues?
- Abortion.

688
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:27,733
Mandatory. Mandatory.

689
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,200
I'm a feminist,
I'm for women's rights 100 percent.

690
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,200
You want your rights, you got them.

691
00:42:36,533 --> 00:42:38,700
As a nation we are overpopulated.

692
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,233
Ladies, this is your chance to shine.

693
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,700
I'm for women's rights 100 percent.

694
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:47,666
When I'm president,
I'm not gonna have a first lady.

695
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:50,933
Because I think ranking women is sexist.

696
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,866
A lot of women in this country get paid
less than men to do the same job.

697
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:04,966
It's a disgrace to the nation.
So, I'm gonna make pay equality a reality

698
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:07,300
by lowering men's wages.

699
00:43:08,633 --> 00:43:11,633
We will now have the equality
we've always dreamed of.

700
00:43:14,266 --> 00:43:16,800
Parenthood is usually better
when it's planned,

701
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,733
so, uh, we'll keep Planned Parenthood.

702
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,633
I, uh...

703
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:22,500
I actually became a father when I was 15.

704
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,600
And at the time I realized I wasn't
mature enough to raise a child of my own,

705
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:29,366
so I adopted.

706
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:34,100
I think I did the right thing.

707
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:38,000
- Any other issues?
- Same-sex marriage.

708
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,233
You're talking about gay marriage?
Okay, also mandatory. Also mandatory.

709
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:46,900
If you're a guy and you wanna marry
a girl, you've gotta fuck a dude first.

710
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,500
If you make that work,

711
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,933
your relationship with a woman
will be pretty simple someday.

712
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,433
Plus, some gay guys like hooking up
with a straight guy,

713
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:01,433
and all women love putting men
through tests.

714
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:06,133
So, it's a win-win-win situation.

715
00:44:09,366 --> 00:44:11,833
Gay marriage was legalized
about a year ago.

716
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:16,333
There were a lot of celebrations in
New York City. It's a very exciting time.

717
00:44:16,433 --> 00:44:19,800
It was a conflicting time for me
because I love gay people,

718
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:21,833
but I hate rainbows.

719
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:23,866
I, uh...

720
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:26,800
I think rainbows are offensive
to the blind.

721
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:31,333
I used to be blind.

722
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:37,833
But then I went gluten-free
and cleared that shit right up.

723
00:44:38,666 --> 00:44:41,633
- Oh, my God.
- Now I have better than perfect vision.

724
00:44:42,633 --> 00:44:44,533
These glasses make my eyes weaker.

725
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:49,666
If I took these glasses off,
your vision would get blurry.

726
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:52,333
You're welcome.

727
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,166
Any other issues?

728
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,466
- Immigration.
- What?

729
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,433
Immigration.

730
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,300
You can stay, you can stay.

731
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,033
Sometimes you've gotta do the right thing.

732
00:45:13,233 --> 00:45:15,766
But I'm deporting your friend
at 8:30 tomorrow.

733
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:18,533
I don't like his attitude.

734
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:22,866
When it comes to immigration,
let everyone in, have a big party.

735
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:27,566
Unless we have proof someone's a violent
criminal, we need border security.

736
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:29,866
And I have a plan.
To seal the borders

737
00:45:30,066 --> 00:45:33,500
I'm going to hire the company
that makes DVD wrappers.

738
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:40,800
If it takes an hour and a half
to open up a DVD package,

739
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,900
imagine what they can do with the borders.

740
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,133
And if a criminal does sneak through,
he gets a free DVD.

741
00:45:49,266 --> 00:45:52,133
He gets a free DVD,
takes him an hour to open it,

742
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:53,733
and you fucking nail him there.

743
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,966
Immigration is a very tricky subject.

744
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,300
Just last year, 10,000 children came up

745
00:46:07,366 --> 00:46:09,333
through Central American countries,

746
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:13,266
through Mexico, across the U.S. border,
and then got busted in Texas.

747
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:15,333
Our government was trying to decide:

748
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:19,000
"What do we do
with these 10,000 desperate children?"

749
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:22,100
I think we should have
let them stick to their plan,

750
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:24,100
which was get to Canada.

751
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,800
I think it's presumptuous of us to think
we were their final destination.

752
00:46:30,966 --> 00:46:33,266
We have no healthcare,
we're overcrowded.

753
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:36,500
Canada has free healthcare
and could use a few fucking people.

754
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,666
Woo!

755
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,433
I'm also gonna build a wall
through the middle of Mexico.

756
00:46:44,466 --> 00:46:47,766
That way they'll get confused
and sneak into Mexico.

757
00:46:50,066 --> 00:46:52,000
Strategy. Strategy.

758
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:02,900
Any other issues?

759
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:07,233
We're getting a lot done.
Any other issues?

760
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,900
- Legalized pot.
- No.

761
00:47:12,366 --> 00:47:14,500
What are you, afraid to break the law?

762
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,833
You're sitting at home all day going,
"I wanna smoke pot,

763
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,566
but I don't wanna get caught
and get in trouble"?

764
00:47:25,066 --> 00:47:27,000
Toughen the fuck up, break the law.

765
00:47:27,766 --> 00:47:29,433
Be a rebel, break the law.

766
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,533
Now, I'm a drug war reenactor, and, uh...

767
00:47:36,433 --> 00:47:40,666
If you get busted for doing drugs,
tell the cops you're a drug war reenactor,

768
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,833
they get confused,

769
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,866
it sounds pro-military,
sometimes they let you off.

770
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:51,066
I don't do drugs.
I'm a role model to children.

771
00:47:51,166 --> 00:47:53,933
But I believe doing drugs
is a personal choice,

772
00:47:54,033 --> 00:47:55,666
not the government's business.

773
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:58,900
So, yeah, when I'm president
I'm gonna legalize drugs.

774
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,333
But I'm not gonna start with marijuana.

775
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,966
I'm gonna start with heroin.

776
00:48:09,333 --> 00:48:10,966
If we legalize heroin first,

777
00:48:11,066 --> 00:48:14,000
it will be very easy to legalize marijuana
after that.

778
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,900
Strategy, strategy.

779
00:48:15,966 --> 00:48:18,233
You've gotta know how to work Congress.

780
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:21,200
Fuck it,
I'll start by legalizing crystal meth.

781
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,733
I'll sidestep Congress.
I'll take it to the people.

782
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,900
I'll mail everyone in the country
an envelope.

783
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:29,233
You mail back teeth, that's a yes.

784
00:48:30,733 --> 00:48:32,900
Power to the people.

785
00:48:35,266 --> 00:48:36,300
Climate change.

786
00:48:36,733 --> 00:48:38,333
I am for climate change.

787
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:44,066
I don't want the same weather every day.

788
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,300
That's fascism.

789
00:48:56,766 --> 00:48:58,633
Who thinks climate change is real?

790
00:49:01,666 --> 00:49:03,133
Who thinks it's man-made?

791
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

792
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,133
That's where you're wrong.
Think about it.

793
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,800
Temperatures are going up,
glaciers are melting,

794
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:12,366
sea levels are rising.

795
00:49:12,766 --> 00:49:13,600
Why?

796
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,033
Fish are trying to take over the planet.

797
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,833
Earth has always been 71 percent water.
Now fish want the whole fucking thing.

798
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,566
Eat as much sushi as you can.

799
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:30,466
Japan has been leading the way on this
for years,

800
00:49:31,166 --> 00:49:33,833
it's time for the rest of the world
to step it the fuck up.

801
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:40,000
I teach science part-time online
at ChristianMingle.com.

802
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:44,466
You guys should definitely take
one of my courses.

803
00:49:49,666 --> 00:49:51,700
So, you think climate change is real?

804
00:49:52,533 --> 00:49:55,133
You think it's bad?
You'd like to curb it?

805
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,466
- And where is home for you?
- Uh, Baltimore.

806
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,066
- Baltimore? Okay.
- Yeah!

807
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:03,400
And do you live in a...?
Do you live in a house or an apartment?

808
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:07,766
I live in... Well, I live in
New Jersey now, but I'm from Baltimore.

809
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,800
Okay, first of all, you're a liar.

810
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:10,700
You're a liar.

811
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,966
In New Jersey,
do you live in a house or an apartment?

812
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:17,800
- Apartment.
- In an apartment.

813
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:21,766
- And is it a new or old building?
- From the '80s, so it depends on...

814
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:23,833
- Uh, what floor are you on?
- Third.

815
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,333
- You have an air conditioner?
- Yeah, thank God.

816
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,166
Then you are for climate change.

817
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,200
Air conditioning literally
is climate change.

818
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,333
Unless you have your air conditioner on,

819
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,166
build a fire in your living room,
and let them battle it out,

820
00:50:42,266 --> 00:50:44,666
then you are fighting climate change.

821
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,133
Otherwise,
you're part of the fucking problem.

822
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,500
We've gotta save water, people.

823
00:50:59,566 --> 00:51:00,966
We've gotta save water.

824
00:51:01,966 --> 00:51:03,433
That's why I don't shower.

825
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,766
I just smear hand sanitizer
all over my body.

826
00:51:08,633 --> 00:51:10,266
I'm sticky, but I'm clean.

827
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,133
And I'm saving the planet.

828
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,600
Any other questions about my presidency?

829
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:19,833
- Any other issues?
- Russia.

830
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,866
Russia. We show them Rocky IV.

831
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:27,833
Russia has never seen
the entire film Rocky IV.

832
00:51:27,966 --> 00:51:31,766
Rocky IV was released in Russia,
but it was a heavily edited version.

833
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,433
They cut it down to 17 minutes.

834
00:51:34,533 --> 00:51:36,866
It ended when Apollo Creed
died in the ring

835
00:51:36,933 --> 00:51:39,833
and they freeze-framed
on Rocky's crying face.

836
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,866
So, they showed it
80 times a day in the theaters.

837
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,833
The highest grossing film ever in Russia.
They never saw the ending,

838
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:50,566
so we have to show them the real movie
and that will clear it up.

839
00:51:50,633 --> 00:51:53,733
The point is
I think we should build a wall.

840
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,100
Around Donald Trump.

841
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,600
- Yeah!
- I, uh...

842
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,433
Put, uh...

843
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:05,000
Put mirrors on the inside,
that way he's happy,

844
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,533
and... I think when Mexico
hears about this they'll be like,

845
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:15,700
"You know what? We'd like to pay for this.
We think this is a bueno investment."

846
00:52:19,066 --> 00:52:20,666
- Coal.
- The economy.

847
00:52:20,766 --> 00:52:24,900
We don't need to bring back coal, but I'll
bring back the VCR repairman jobs.

848
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:34,333
This country was built on VHS tapes.

849
00:52:35,633 --> 00:52:38,533
VHS repair jobs

850
00:52:38,633 --> 00:52:42,000
used to be the biggest industry
in the nation.

851
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,300
It was the heart of our economy,
and now it's gone to shit.

852
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:51,533
VHS is the premier way
to watch a movie at home.

853
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:55,433
Sure,
those critics out there will tell you

854
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,833
that Blu-ray has a sharper image,

855
00:52:57,933 --> 00:53:00,600
but VHS is sharper emotionally.

856
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:02,466
And...

857
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:08,033
When I'm president
I'm gonna make college free.

858
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,533
You gotta pay for high school.
You gotta pay for high school.

859
00:53:14,033 --> 00:53:17,400
You're gonna pay for it one way
or the other. Might as well be cash.

860
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,100
And I'm going to raise the minimum wage
to 15 bucks an hour.

861
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,266
And I'm going to lower the maximum wage
to 14.50.

862
00:53:28,766 --> 00:53:30,966
Put those CEOs in their place.

863
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,966
Who here recycles?

864
00:53:35,866 --> 00:53:37,833
I'm gonna ban recycling.

865
00:53:38,866 --> 00:53:41,766
Because I think segregating garbage
is racist.

866
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:47,600
Brown v. Board of Education, 1954,
separate is not equal.

867
00:53:48,533 --> 00:53:51,533
All the trash
gets put in this disgusting dirty bag

868
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,266
while the recyclables
get a cute little shower

869
00:53:54,366 --> 00:53:58,033
and then put in this privileged
sky blue clear bag. It's not right.

870
00:53:59,066 --> 00:54:01,333
And I'm gonna ban brunch.

871
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:05,466
Because I am against corporate mergers.

872
00:54:05,566 --> 00:54:07,600
Breakfast and lunch coming together.

873
00:54:07,666 --> 00:54:09,733
It's too much power.
I'm gonna break it up.

874
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,966
And I'm gonna ban the Winter Olympics.

875
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,966
It's wrong that whatever country wins
the most medals at the Winter Olympics

876
00:54:20,066 --> 00:54:21,300
gets to invade Ukraine.

877
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,333
I don't know why that is part
of the official Olympic platform,

878
00:54:25,433 --> 00:54:26,566
but I'm against it.

879
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,833
And I'm gonna add three moons.

880
00:54:32,433 --> 00:54:36,600
This is America, we shouldn't have to
share our moon with any other country.

881
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,600
If we add three,
we've got a total of four,

882
00:54:39,666 --> 00:54:42,266
now werewolves can go out
and party once a week.

883
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,400
They're restricted to once a month.
That's why they get violent.

884
00:54:46,466 --> 00:54:48,933
They've been in solitary
for 30 days straight.

885
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:59,733
Mermaids have been protecting
our ocean borders for over 200 years

886
00:55:00,466 --> 00:55:04,200
and still do not have the right to vote.
It's wrong.

887
00:55:06,633 --> 00:55:11,666
The key to surviving the zombie apocalypse
is... dentistry.

888
00:55:13,466 --> 00:55:17,200
Before they turn into zombies,
the dentists extract their teeth,

889
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,500
and then they gnaw on you
with their gums

890
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,500
and just give you a nice massage.
Just relax the whole planet.

891
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:27,966
Zombies plus dentistry equals world peace.

892
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:33,466
- Has anyone here ever seen a UFO?
- Yeah.

893
00:55:33,866 --> 00:55:37,133
Really? I have never seen a UFO.

894
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,833
Because I've always been able
to correctly identify the alien spacecraft

895
00:55:42,733 --> 00:55:44,166
that I have come across.

896
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,466
You see, that's the difference
between you and me.

897
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,000
Do you think dinosaurs went extinct?

898
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:54,366
I do not.

899
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,700
I think dinosaurs are bone creatures
who live underground.

900
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:04,033
And archaeologists dig them up,
ripping them out of their homes

901
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,166
and murdering them.

902
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:09,366
And then they sell their body parts
to museums

903
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:12,033
where they are put on display
to scare children.

904
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:14,100
It's a big problem.

905
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,866
Other questions
about my presidential platform?

906
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:21,200
Gun control.

907
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:23,666
I think if Jesus had been American,

908
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,600
and had a gun,

909
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,066
he'd still be alive today.

910
00:56:31,666 --> 00:56:36,233
They try to nail him to the cross, he'd be
like, "Not so fast, you pieces of shit."

911
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,566
Jesus, America, victory.

912
00:56:46,533 --> 00:56:49,600
In a perfect world people would
be good enough at karate

913
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:51,233
so they wouldn't need a gun,

914
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:55,366
but I realize not everyone
can be a karate hero like myself.

915
00:56:55,433 --> 00:56:57,700
Now, it's not my style,

916
00:56:57,766 --> 00:57:01,466
but if you have a gun and you go hunting
and eat what you hunted,

917
00:57:01,533 --> 00:57:05,733
that should be okay. But if you have a gun
and kill a person, right to jail.

918
00:57:06,266 --> 00:57:10,433
Unless you eat the person,
then I think it should be okay.

919
00:57:11,866 --> 00:57:15,166
Let's get a friendly poll here,
nobody's opinions are wrong,

920
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:17,633
nobody boo,
let's get a friendly poll.

921
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:20,300
Who here, by round of applause,
wants less guns?

922
00:57:20,866 --> 00:57:22,266
Okay.

923
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:25,333
Who wants more guns?

924
00:57:26,766 --> 00:57:28,100
Okay, you're both wrong.

925
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:31,666
Karate is the answer to gun control.

926
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:35,600
Fists don't run out of knuckles,
feet don't have to reload,

927
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:37,100
elbows don't get jammed.

928
00:57:37,533 --> 00:57:38,866
I live in New York City.

929
00:57:38,966 --> 00:57:41,633
A guy tried to mug me last year
and he had a gun,

930
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,866
but I had a bucket of diarrhea.

931
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,266
I dumped it over his head,
he shot himself.

932
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:52,500
That's karate strategy.

933
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:57,600
New York City has a program
to get illegal guns off the street.

934
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:58,733
Guns for cash.

935
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,833
Where if you have an illegal gun,
you can turn it in,

936
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,166
the government won't ask
any questions,

937
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:07,300
they give you $200,
that illegal gun is off the street.

938
00:58:07,366 --> 00:58:10,800
When I'm president,
I'm doing the exact same thing nationwide,

939
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,066
except with Ashton Kutcher movies.

940
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,500
If you own a movie
starring Ashton Kutcher,

941
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:22,100
you can turn it in, no questions asked...

942
00:58:24,366 --> 00:58:27,300
and we will give you $500,000...

943
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,533
and a gun.

944
00:58:31,566 --> 00:58:33,500
Just trying to make America better.

945
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:40,800
How do you feel about parents
who don't vaccinate their kids?

946
00:58:43,166 --> 00:58:46,366
I don't think anti-vaxers
are anti-science.

947
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,233
I think they are just
pro-diseases' rights.

948
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:53,700
And it's about time
somebody stands up for bacteria.

949
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,700
Fracking, where do you stand?
For or against it?

950
00:59:00,233 --> 00:59:03,166
I'm for it. I think they're just trying
to kill the devil.

951
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:08,433
If they drill deep enough one day
they'll hit the devil right in the skull.

952
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,000
I guess you guys are pro-devil.

953
00:59:12,866 --> 00:59:15,000
- Are you all religious? Yes? No?
- No.

954
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:15,933
It's okay.

955
00:59:16,233 --> 00:59:18,900
How religious are you?
If you see a big building,

956
00:59:18,966 --> 00:59:22,133
do you call it a skyscraper
or heaven tickler, what do you say?

957
00:59:23,933 --> 00:59:25,300
I'm just trying to gauge.

958
00:59:25,766 --> 00:59:28,966
The Bible says
love thy neighbor as thyself.

959
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,233
What if you hate yourself? That's caused
some problems over the years.

960
00:59:35,066 --> 00:59:36,766
I used to think I was Jewish.

961
00:59:38,966 --> 00:59:40,733
I used to think I was Jewish.

962
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:44,733
And then some Jewish people told me
I wasn't Jewish.

963
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,266
According to a lot of Jewish people,

964
00:59:47,366 --> 00:59:51,500
unless your mom's Jewish,
you're not Jewish. No fucking exceptions.

965
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,400
My name's very Jewish.
My dad's Jewish, but my mom's Catholic.

966
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:59,800
A lot of Jewish people, when they meet me
think I'm Jewish by their definition,

967
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,766
and when they find out my mom's Catholic

968
01:00:01,866 --> 01:00:05,366
they think I tried to trick them
into thinking I was Jewish

969
01:00:05,433 --> 01:00:07,466
and I'm some kind of evil fake Jew.

970
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,166
According to Hitler,

971
01:00:10,266 --> 01:00:13,800
if one grandparent was Jewish,
he considered you Jewish

972
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,800
and had you sent for extermination.

973
01:00:16,066 --> 01:00:20,233
So, in a way, Hitler was actually
more inclusive of the Jews

974
01:00:20,966 --> 01:00:22,866
than many Jews today.

975
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,966
Racism, where do you stand?
For it or against it?

976
01:00:35,933 --> 01:00:37,300
A lot of undecided.

977
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:43,066
Racism, big problem,
but we're still number one at it.

978
01:00:44,933 --> 01:00:46,666
Racism is everywhere you look,

979
01:00:46,766 --> 01:00:49,233
it's part of the country's
founding structure,

980
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,966
it's still there
and it's never gonna get better

981
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:54,500
unless people at least start talking
about it.

982
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:57,266
It's everywhere you look.
Hollywood's racist.

983
01:00:57,766 --> 01:01:01,233
Anyone know what the first
Hollywood blockbuster ever made was?

984
01:01:01,666 --> 01:01:05,066
- Birth of a Nation.
- Birth of a Nation, 1915,

985
01:01:05,166 --> 01:01:07,433
based on a book called The Clansman.

986
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:10,733
And in the movie,
the KKK are the good guys.

987
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:12,533
Hollywood should be like,

988
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:16,133
"Yeah, we fucked up
on that one, sorry." Start a dialogue.

989
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,633
Then there's a chance
things can get better.

990
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:22,333
A lot of black people in the movie
are white people in blackface.

991
01:01:22,433 --> 01:01:25,700
Hollywood should be like,
"Yeah, we fucked up there. Sorry."

992
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:29,500
Hollywood will take a white show
and make it whiter.

993
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,366
Anyone remember the show
Everybody Loves Raymond?

994
01:01:33,533 --> 01:01:36,333
The lead actor, Italian-American,
dark brown hair.

995
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:38,533
His wife on the show, dark brown hair.

996
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:41,166
Their three little kids on the show?
All blond.

997
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,866
That's Hollywood taking a white show
and making it whiter.

998
01:01:45,033 --> 01:01:47,233
If they're whitewashing a white show,

999
01:01:47,333 --> 01:01:51,433
imagine what they're doing to any
other show if that show gets a chance.

1000
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:55,300
But that's what Hollywood's about.
It's about thin, blond and white.

1001
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:57,366
So, how do we solve this problem?

1002
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,000
We invade Sweden.

1003
01:01:59,066 --> 01:02:03,600
We invade Sweden, the blondest,
whitest country in the world,

1004
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,800
and everyone will be like,
"Why did America bomb Sweden?"

1005
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:09,300
And we're like,
"Because Hollywood's racist."

1006
01:02:10,033 --> 01:02:11,433
That's the American way.

1007
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:12,800
When we have a problem,

1008
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,933
we invade the wrong country
and everything is perfect.

1009
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,566
Hollywood has made some progress, though.
Uh...

1010
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:29,066
The TV show How to Get Away with Murder
changed its name to Become a Cop.

1011
01:02:30,433 --> 01:02:32,433
I was like,
"That's a pretty bold move

1012
01:02:32,533 --> 01:02:34,866
coming from a corporate network
like that."

1013
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:38,800
What's your favorite Asian film
Hollywood made?

1014
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:42,033
Mine's The Last Samurai,
starring Tom Cruise.

1015
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,500
Good job, Hollywood. Good job there, too.

1016
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,600
Racism is everywhere you look.

1017
01:02:48,366 --> 01:02:50,366
I think astronauts are racists.

1018
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,700
Yeah, I said it, buddy.
I think astronauts are racists.

1019
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:57,866
- What year did we land on the moon?
- '69.

1020
01:02:57,933 --> 01:03:01,833
1969, right at the tail end
of the civil rights era.

1021
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:05,366
Right when black Americans
had been marching and protesting

1022
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:07,366
and getting some legislation passed

1023
01:03:07,466 --> 01:03:09,633
so they could get
a bit of human rights.

1024
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,866
And a bunch of white guys
got on a rocket and left the planet.

1025
01:03:14,433 --> 01:03:16,933
To start an all-white race on the moon.

1026
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,600
I'm not even gonna guess
what the N in NASA stands for.

1027
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:22,866
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna do it.

1028
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:26,300
And they didn't bring any women
because they were sexist.

1029
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,666
They were afraid of being
defeated by a woman

1030
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:31,100
in a no-gravity zone.

1031
01:03:32,966 --> 01:03:36,566
So, they made their new home the moon,
or as they called it, "White Junior."

1032
01:03:39,166 --> 01:03:41,800
I think the New York City Marathon
is racist.

1033
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,433
Ten thousand white people
chasing five Africans.

1034
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,366
The most racist sporting display
I have ever seen.

1035
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:55,133
I'm like, "Stop chasing them,
they've done nothing wrong.

1036
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:57,933
And you're not gonna catch them...

1037
01:03:59,066 --> 01:04:01,533
you fucking slow racists."

1038
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:06,700
And if you didn't laugh at that,
you might be a fucking slow racist.

1039
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,333
I wanna talk terminology for a second.

1040
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:14,666
A question for black people
in the audience,

1041
01:04:14,733 --> 01:04:16,766
just to make everyone uncomfortable,

1042
01:04:17,566 --> 01:04:19,866
the term black, is it preferred?

1043
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:21,733
Or African-American?

1044
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,933
- Hello? Hello?
- Oh, my God.

1045
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:32,433
- Anyone wanna answer the question or...?
- Black is fine.

1046
01:04:32,766 --> 01:04:34,200
You like black? Okay.

1047
01:04:35,033 --> 01:04:37,433
What about this?
You hear this on the news.

1048
01:04:37,533 --> 01:04:41,500
Sometimes the news will refer
to a black person as a person of color.

1049
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:45,033
You don't like that? Okay.

1050
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:48,533
If the news refers
to a black person as a person of color,

1051
01:04:48,633 --> 01:04:52,833
they should start referring
to white people as a person without color.

1052
01:04:53,433 --> 01:04:54,733
Sad.

1053
01:04:55,700 --> 01:05:00,100
Just fearing the sun every day,
praying for the night.

1054
01:05:01,466 --> 01:05:03,200
White people are so oppressed,

1055
01:05:03,266 --> 01:05:07,300
living on a planet that circles
the very thing they fear every day.

1056
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,766
Since the beginning of time.

1057
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:15,600
All right, let's lighten up
the mood a little bit.

1058
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:19,400
Uh... Reparations. Reparations.

1059
01:05:19,766 --> 01:05:23,766
Should black Americans
receive reparations?

1060
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:29,066
One person says yes,
the rest of you, fucking racist.

1061
01:05:29,133 --> 01:05:32,500
Fucking racist, remember their faces.

1062
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,466
I think black Americans
should receive reparations.

1063
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:38,900
How do you think it should be given out?

1064
01:05:40,633 --> 01:05:41,500
No ideas?

1065
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,133
Nothing?

1066
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,766
- Economic allowances.
- Trump Tower!

1067
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:50,466
Economic allowances. Okay.
I was thinking white slavery.

1068
01:05:50,566 --> 01:05:51,600
White slavery.

1069
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,500
If you're black American,
you can own Donald Trump.

1070
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:57,766
Please!

1071
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:01,866
Or his creepy kid Eric,
he could be a house slave.

1072
01:06:01,966 --> 01:06:03,533
Donald, way out in the field.

1073
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:06,566
Far, far, far from the home.

1074
01:06:11,266 --> 01:06:13,900
- Whoa, what did you drop?
- A candle.

1075
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,333
A candle? Okay.

1076
01:06:17,466 --> 01:06:20,866
Sorry, can't relate. I've, uh...
I've never dropped anything before.

1077
01:06:22,533 --> 01:06:24,566
I have perfect grip, so just...

1078
01:06:24,866 --> 01:06:28,200
I'd like to relate to what
you're going through, but I can't.

1079
01:06:29,033 --> 01:06:30,633
I hope you can power through.

1080
01:06:32,633 --> 01:06:34,766
- ISIS.
- Are you afraid of ISIS?

1081
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,566
- You tell me.
- Yeah, I think you are.

1082
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:44,133
I think that's the reason
you asked the question.

1083
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:47,866
Have you ever had a close call with ISIS?

1084
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:51,700
You ever get home late at night...

1085
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,766
honey's like, "How was your day?"

1086
01:06:55,833 --> 01:06:59,166
You're like, "Pretty good,
almost got fucked up by ISIS.

1087
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:02,466
Fortunately it worked out."
Nothing to worry about.

1088
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:05,266
That's the news trying to scare you.

1089
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:08,833
The news is talking about something
from another country,

1090
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,533
and it's coming here,
so you better be scared.

1091
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:14,766
They do the same thing with diseases.
Like the Zika virus.

1092
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:18,700
It's a disease from another country
and it's coming, so be scared.

1093
01:07:18,933 --> 01:07:22,100
Nothing to worry about. Look at me.
I've had Ebola for six weeks.

1094
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:25,233
I'm fucking perfect.

1095
01:07:26,566 --> 01:07:28,600
A few years ago it was the swine flu.

1096
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,233
When that happened,
I gave a pig the human flu.

1097
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:33,033
Fight back. Fight back.

1098
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,833
This country needs to toughen the fuck up.

1099
01:07:41,633 --> 01:07:43,966
- Any other issues?
- Citizens United.

1100
01:07:44,466 --> 01:07:45,566
I think we should...

1101
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:48,133
Citizens should unite
against Citizens United.

1102
01:07:48,233 --> 01:07:49,066
I think...

1103
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:52,866
You just earned yourself
a cabinet position, well done.

1104
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,200
I think eventually
everyone gets the death penalty.

1105
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,133
It should really be called
the murder penalty.

1106
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:06,200
If you were on death row,
what would you request for your last meal?

1107
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,166
Taco Bell.

1108
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,633
Okay.

1109
01:08:11,433 --> 01:08:14,833
I'd request the finger of the guy
flipping the electric switch.

1110
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,433
Buy myself a few extra minutes.

1111
01:08:19,633 --> 01:08:23,133
For a beverage I'd request
the blood from the warden's body.

1112
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:26,300
And then my dessert would be freedom.

1113
01:08:27,766 --> 01:08:29,633
You see? Strategy, strategy.

1114
01:08:30,033 --> 01:08:33,800
You gotta look at the big picture,
not just the short satisfaction.

1115
01:08:35,966 --> 01:08:41,466
Europeans and Canadians live longer

1116
01:08:41,533 --> 01:08:43,033
than Americans.

1117
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,600
Americans die sooner
than Europeans and Canadians.

1118
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,899
- And why is that?
- Healthcare.

1119
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,033
No, it's because we're efficient.
We get shit done faster.

1120
01:08:54,533 --> 01:08:58,633
You Europeans and Canadians are slow,
you're lazy,

1121
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:03,266
you don't know what the fuck you're doing,
and you're greedy.

1122
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:07,533
You're taking all this time to get
shit done, you never accomplish anything.

1123
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:11,466
We get shit done and let it go,
we let the next generation take over.

1124
01:09:11,533 --> 01:09:14,233
We're progressive that way, we share,
you know.

1125
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:17,399
Uh, you guys are clock hoggers.
You know, just...

1126
01:09:18,566 --> 01:09:20,000
Sexual education?

1127
01:09:20,899 --> 01:09:23,566
I don't think it should be part of school.
I, uh...

1128
01:09:23,666 --> 01:09:26,066
It should be something you learn
on your own.

1129
01:09:28,899 --> 01:09:31,700
It might not work out well,
but you'll remember it better.

1130
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:35,733
Comprehension, very important, everybody.

1131
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:36,733
Very important.

1132
01:09:36,866 --> 01:09:39,700
It's not what you learn,
it's how well you learn it.

1133
01:09:40,233 --> 01:09:42,366
How do you approach income inequality?

1134
01:09:43,233 --> 01:09:44,899
How much you need?
How much you need?

1135
01:09:48,333 --> 01:09:49,733
National drinking age.

1136
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:52,733
How old are you?

1137
01:09:53,866 --> 01:09:55,600
- How old are you?
- Old enough.

1138
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,733
- How old are you?
- Twenty-eight.

1139
01:09:58,166 --> 01:09:59,733
I'm raising it to 29.

1140
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,333
What about North Korea?

1141
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:06,833
Okay, this guy's a spy.

1142
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:08,100
This guy's a spy.

1143
01:10:09,866 --> 01:10:12,033
Nobody talk to this guy after the show.

1144
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:16,166
Don't give him a hug,
he'll plant something on you.

1145
01:10:16,233 --> 01:10:18,166
He'll plant a tracker or something.

1146
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,100
Second row, what's your name?
What do you do?

1147
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:25,033
- Yeah.
- I work in social media.

1148
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,833
Social media. What is that?

1149
01:10:27,033 --> 01:10:29,900
I help...
I help brands be good at social media.

1150
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,466
You help brands be good at social media.

1151
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:36,966
So, what's an example of a brand
being good at social media?

1152
01:10:37,033 --> 01:10:38,066
I don't understand.

1153
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:41,000
- It's complicated.
- It's complicated?

1154
01:10:41,566 --> 01:10:43,466
So, what are some of these brands?

1155
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,466
Bud Light is one.

1156
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,766
- Bud Light?
- Yeah.

1157
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:50,266
Does anyone follow Bud Light on Twitter?

1158
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:54,900
Because, you know,

1159
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,400
there's lots of stuff
happening in the world these days...

1160
01:11:01,033 --> 01:11:05,533
and when I see some breaking news,
I wanna be like,

1161
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,466
"What does Bud Light think about this?"

1162
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:13,633
What would your presidential slogan be?

1163
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,100
Worst question of the night, sir.

1164
01:11:17,766 --> 01:11:19,633
No slogan. It's a movement, buddy.

1165
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:21,833
It's beyond that.

1166
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,166
I expected better from you, dude.

1167
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,266
- Your running mate.
- What?

1168
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:29,900
- Your running mate?
- I won't have a running mate.

1169
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:33,133
First, I'm not running for president.
I'm standing for president.

1170
01:11:33,633 --> 01:11:35,166
Running means you're scared.

1171
01:11:40,066 --> 01:11:41,766
And I will not have a VP

1172
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:44,966
because I view having an assistant
as a sign of weakness.

1173
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,800
Heroes stand alone and get shit done.

1174
01:11:48,533 --> 01:11:51,800
If I had a vice president,
the first thing I'd do in office,

1175
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,633
I'd karate kick him in the face.

1176
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:56,400
Let him know
who runs this fucking country.

1177
01:11:59,933 --> 01:12:02,000
- Any other issues?
- Term limits.

1178
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,400
I think we should have term limits
for citizens.

1179
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,966
Everyone gets four years,

1180
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,700
and if you do a good job

1181
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:14,366
and your neighbors don't think
you're an asshole

1182
01:12:14,466 --> 01:12:16,200
you can stay for another four.

1183
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:20,166
Maybe people would be a little nicer
to each other that way.

1184
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:29,633
We have a lot of weird holidays
in America.

1185
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,200
Christopher Columbus Day,
that's a weird one.

1186
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:37,033
It's about the guy, Christopher Columbus,
who discovered America.

1187
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:41,333
Germany, do you have a holiday
about the person who discovered Germany?

1188
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:46,466
No? Then I guess it's not
a country worth celebrating.

1189
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,533
It's a weird holiday,
Christopher Columbus Day.

1190
01:12:52,633 --> 01:12:56,700
He's the guy, Christopher Columbus,
who discovered America.

1191
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,833
Even though there was
millions of people living here

1192
01:12:59,900 --> 01:13:01,300
for thousands of years.

1193
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,166
He called them Indians.

1194
01:13:05,233 --> 01:13:08,433
He thought he landed in India,
but he landed in America.

1195
01:13:08,533 --> 01:13:12,966
But he just kept calling them Indians.
They pretty much slaughtered all Indians,

1196
01:13:13,066 --> 01:13:15,400
and we have a holiday
celebrating that guy.

1197
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,266
That's kind of weird.

1198
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:20,366
How should we celebrate
Christopher Columbus Day?

1199
01:13:20,433 --> 01:13:24,400
Here's a thought. You know when you're
in a big building on a high floor

1200
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,033
and go down to the lobby,

1201
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:29,900
but the elevator's crowded
and someone else has pressed floor three,

1202
01:13:30,266 --> 01:13:32,100
but you weren't paying attention,

1203
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,166
so when the elevator stops on floor three
you get off

1204
01:13:35,233 --> 01:13:38,766
because you think it's the lobby,
and instead of realizing that

1205
01:13:39,066 --> 01:13:41,800
and turning back around
into the crowded elevator

1206
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:46,066
and admitting you're a moron, you're like,
"Hey, sorry, I'm a fucking idiot.

1207
01:13:46,166 --> 01:13:49,166
I wasn't paying attention.
I thought it was the lobby."

1208
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:50,466
No, you don't admit it,

1209
01:13:50,566 --> 01:13:55,600
you just stay on floor three
and you pretend it's the lobby.

1210
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,466
And then you murder everyone
on floor three.

1211
01:14:03,266 --> 01:14:06,333
That's how we should celebrate
Christopher Columbus Day.

1212
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:08,500
Just a thought, just a thought.

1213
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:13,333
Thanksgiving, that's an American holiday.

1214
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:18,433
Canada, you celebrate Thanksgiving.
On the wrong day, but you celebrate it.

1215
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:21,633
And, Canada, what are you thankful for?

1216
01:14:22,233 --> 01:14:23,600
That you border America.

1217
01:14:23,666 --> 01:14:25,500
That's it, that's all you got.

1218
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:28,766
Germany, you don't celebrate Thanksgiving.

1219
01:14:28,833 --> 01:14:31,433
It's because you got nothing
to be thankful for.

1220
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,300
Always try to remember that.

1221
01:14:34,233 --> 01:14:37,600
We celebrate it
because we're such a narcissistic country

1222
01:14:37,666 --> 01:14:40,866
we need a holiday to force us
to say thank you once a year.

1223
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:43,666
Because normally we do not say thank you.

1224
01:14:43,766 --> 01:14:45,366
We say "you're welcome" a lot.

1225
01:14:46,633 --> 01:14:49,100
Often after a country
did not say "thank you."

1226
01:14:49,166 --> 01:14:51,233
They usually said,
"Ouch. Cut it out, stop."

1227
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,133
And we're like, "You're welcome."

1228
01:14:54,766 --> 01:14:57,833
Why do we have turkey on Thanksgiving?
Does anyone know?

1229
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,700
Why do we have turkey on Thanksgiving?

1230
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:04,800
Are you completely uneducated?

1231
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,200
Nobody knows? It's okay if you don't.
The government doesn't want you

1232
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,366
to know the truth.

1233
01:15:12,933 --> 01:15:15,500
The real reason we have turkey
on Thanksgiving

1234
01:15:16,033 --> 01:15:17,666
is because just 80 years ago

1235
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:21,300
this entire country
was enslaved by turkeys.

1236
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:26,233
And it was not till we invented the baster
we were able to rise up

1237
01:15:26,733 --> 01:15:28,300
and conquer the evil turkey.

1238
01:15:28,366 --> 01:15:32,200
That's why today on Thanksgiving
not only do we kill and eat a turkey,

1239
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,933
we stuff shit up its ass
to humiliate the turkey

1240
01:15:35,033 --> 01:15:37,733
and send the message
that it never happens again.

1241
01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:44,533
I teach American history part-time online
at Axe Body Spray University.

1242
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,166
You guys should definitely
take one of my courses.

1243
01:15:49,566 --> 01:15:50,900
What's Christmas about?

1244
01:15:52,533 --> 01:15:55,000
- Presents.
- Presents? No.

1245
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:56,000
Jesus.

1246
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,233
Wrong again.

1247
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:00,466
- America.
- Nope, it's about killing trees.

1248
01:16:01,566 --> 01:16:05,633
Because just 90 years ago,
this entire country was ruled by trees.

1249
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:10,366
And it was not until we invented the ax
that we conquered the tree.

1250
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:13,800
That's why on Christmas,
not only do we kill a tree,

1251
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:17,900
we put it up in our living room by the
window so other trees can see it,

1252
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:21,500
and let them know
we're not fucking around.

1253
01:16:22,933 --> 01:16:25,500
Sometimes we put up a fake tree
to let them know

1254
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,466
they can be replaced at any time.

1255
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:32,233
And then we give each other presents
to show our human superiority,

1256
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:35,866
and presents are wrapped in paper,
which is made out of trees.

1257
01:16:37,633 --> 01:16:39,500
Know your fucking history, people.

1258
01:16:43,966 --> 01:16:46,366
Can you believe
that we're the only country

1259
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:48,366
that celebrates the Fourth of July?

1260
01:16:50,366 --> 01:16:53,933
America's birthday,
most important holiday on the planet,

1261
01:16:54,633 --> 01:16:57,633
and we're the only ones celebrating it.
It's fucked up.

1262
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:03,333
A lot of countries hate America.
Why do some countries hate America?

1263
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,733
Let's hear it, foreigners.
We're all friends.

1264
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:09,833
Why do some countries hate America?

1265
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,966
They're trying to police the world.

1266
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:14,533
We try to police the world.

1267
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:17,166
Because we bomb countries
that never attack us.

1268
01:17:17,233 --> 01:17:20,200
That's what the government refers to
as a nonissue.

1269
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,133
Way off, buddy.

1270
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,733
The real reason
other countries hate America

1271
01:17:26,833 --> 01:17:32,066
is because America
has the greatest cheese in the world.

1272
01:17:32,933 --> 01:17:39,200
American cheese is the greatest cheese
on Earth.

1273
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:44,000
That's why each slice
comes in its own protective wrapping.

1274
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,666
To preserve and protect

1275
01:17:46,733 --> 01:17:50,066
the subtle nuances
and amazing super glory of justice

1276
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,866
that is American cheese.

1277
01:17:52,233 --> 01:17:55,466
Other countries don't have
the technology to replicate it,

1278
01:17:55,933 --> 01:17:57,933
so they're jealous and they hate us.

1279
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,866
In France, you get a wedge of Brie,
it's unwrapped,

1280
01:18:00,933 --> 01:18:03,133
broken cracker bits,
bloody fingernails.

1281
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:04,566
It's fucking disgusting.

1282
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:09,100
I teach international politics part-time
online at Kambridge, with a K.

1283
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:12,033
You guys should definitely take
one of my courses.

1284
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:16,633
Do you like the zoo?

1285
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:18,066
- No.
- Yeah.

1286
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:21,600
- Why not?
- Because they're slaves.

1287
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,933
It's true, they're segregated.

1288
01:18:26,766 --> 01:18:29,766
In theory the zoo is nice,
but you go, it's segregated.

1289
01:18:29,866 --> 01:18:31,766
You have gazelles fenced in here...

1290
01:18:33,533 --> 01:18:35,500
lemurs caged in over here.

1291
01:18:35,866 --> 01:18:38,200
That's why one day
I'll open up my own zoo.

1292
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:41,200
One room, every animal out for themselves.

1293
01:18:42,133 --> 01:18:45,133
With a naked guy in the middle
trying to get out alive.

1294
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,400
That's a zoo.

1295
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:51,733
I'll have some gorillas
playing tug-of-war with an anaconda,

1296
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,866
100 chickens attacking a giraffe.

1297
01:18:54,933 --> 01:18:58,233
That's a zoo. That's right,
I'm having chickens in my zoo.

1298
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:00,700
They're the underclass
of the animal world.

1299
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:03,333
I'm also gonna have pigeons,

1300
01:19:03,433 --> 01:19:05,866
or as you might call them, homeless birds.

1301
01:19:09,633 --> 01:19:12,566
What animal don't you see at the zoo?
The cow.

1302
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,200
But what do you see at the zoo?

1303
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:17,333
A snack bar,
where you get a cheeseburger.

1304
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:22,833
So, cows are at the zoo,
just in a different presentation.

1305
01:19:28,866 --> 01:19:32,566
We have a lot of problems in this country,
but we gotta appreciate the progress

1306
01:19:32,633 --> 01:19:34,566
that we have made in certain areas.

1307
01:19:35,433 --> 01:19:38,000
Twins, for example,
today have full rights.

1308
01:19:39,966 --> 01:19:42,866
Forty years ago,
twins had no rights in this country.

1309
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:47,000
Forty years ago, you could kill a twin,
it wouldn't matter.

1310
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:51,000
On trial for murder,
judge would be like, "You killed a man."

1311
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:55,066
You go, "Yeah, Your Honor, but there's
a fucking other one right there."

1312
01:19:55,466 --> 01:19:57,500
And he'd be like, "Oh, my bad."

1313
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,000
Then they'd just let you off.

1314
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:02,833
But today, twins are safe.

1315
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,166
It's still legal to kill a triplet
in this country, but twins are safe.

1316
01:20:11,066 --> 01:20:13,866
- What are you doing later tonight, buddy?
- Tonight?

1317
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:17,866
Catch up with some mates,
smoke some weed. Pretty nice.

1318
01:20:17,966 --> 01:20:21,966
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I got a copy of Planet of the Apes,

1319
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:28,066
and tonight I'm gonna break into the zoo
and screen it for the apes.

1320
01:20:29,766 --> 01:20:30,966
Start a revolution.

1321
01:20:31,766 --> 01:20:35,500
Humans made a film about the apes
but never showed it to the apes.

1322
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:39,100
That's not right.
Tonight, that's gonna change.

1323
01:20:40,433 --> 01:20:41,633
Do you wanna go?

1324
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:44,766
Sorry, apes only.

1325
01:20:46,166 --> 01:20:47,700
This is their time.

1326
01:20:48,966 --> 01:20:51,166
I'm actually going on vacation tomorrow.

1327
01:20:52,066 --> 01:20:54,266
I'm excited, going away for three weeks.

1328
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,833
- It's gonna be great.
- Where you going?

1329
01:20:56,933 --> 01:20:59,133
Coney Island. Coney Island.

1330
01:20:59,466 --> 01:21:04,566
For three weeks, gonna away from it all.
Just relax, get some culture.

1331
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:08,200
Who knows? Maybe hook up with
some island girls. See how it goes.

1332
01:21:09,066 --> 01:21:10,833
You gotta see the world, people.

1333
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,166
Well, I expect all of your votes tomorrow.

1334
01:21:17,133 --> 01:21:18,733
Yep.

1335
01:21:20,166 --> 01:21:22,333
You guys have done a great job tonight.

1336
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:25,500
Sir, you started out
as the worst audience member...

1337
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:29,933
and you worked your way
up to the bottom 20 percent.

1338
01:21:31,166 --> 01:21:33,566
I always knew
you had that kind of potential.

1339
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,000
Sir, I did not talk to you...

1340
01:21:37,033 --> 01:21:38,233
because I don't like you.

1341
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:41,866
I think you have a serious
attitude problem.

1342
01:21:42,133 --> 01:21:45,900
As a matter of fact, nobody make
eye contact with him after the show.

1343
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:49,033
Well...

1344
01:21:50,366 --> 01:21:53,433
I recommend that you guys, uh,
stick around after the show

1345
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,700
and watch the credits.

1346
01:21:57,733 --> 01:21:59,266
I heard they're really cool.

1347
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:04,433
Other questions before I go?
Any other questions?

1348
01:22:05,266 --> 01:22:06,233
Any other issues?

1349
01:22:07,233 --> 01:22:08,466
- Trade.
- Trade?

1350
01:22:09,133 --> 01:22:11,433
I'm gonna trade you
for another audience member.

1351
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:18,766
Any other issues before I go?

1352
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,966
- Marijuana.
- Immigration.

1353
01:22:21,066 --> 01:22:24,300
Marijuana, immigration,
good combination question.

1354
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:30,300
Only immigrants get to smoke pot.

1355
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,033
Yeah!

1356
01:22:36,933 --> 01:22:38,100
Any other issues?

1357
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,100
The environment.

1358
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,233
You for it or against it?
I don't understand the question.

1359
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,933
As president I will keep the environment.

1360
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,100
I will not deport the environment

1361
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,433
or put a roof up over the country
or a sky wall

1362
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:54,133
as some people are asking for.

1363
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:01,300
I think climate change won the Cold War.

1364
01:23:09,733 --> 01:23:12,400
When I'm president
I'm gonna move the border every day.

1365
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,633
Keep this country on its toes.

1366
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:20,666
I might have it go
through Cincinnati one morning.

1367
01:23:21,533 --> 01:23:23,200
They'll be like, "What is going on?"

1368
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,366
I'll be like, "Should've checked
the border app on your phone."

1369
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,466
Any other questions? Other questions?

1370
01:23:30,533 --> 01:23:33,200
- Prison system.
- What about the prison system?

1371
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,633
We have one of the most diverse
prison systems in the world.

1372
01:23:39,766 --> 01:23:41,400
Outsourcing in automation.

1373
01:23:42,533 --> 01:23:44,066
Are you a robot or a human?

1374
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,300
Describe your perfect day.

1375
01:23:54,466 --> 01:23:56,833
Anything where that doesn't happen.
