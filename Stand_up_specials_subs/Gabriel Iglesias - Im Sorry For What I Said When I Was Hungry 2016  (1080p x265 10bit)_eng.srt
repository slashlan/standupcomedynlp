1
00:00:06,632 --> 00:00:09,259
Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!

2
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,814
Give it up and make some noise

3
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:29,196
for Mr. Gabriel Iglesias!

4
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,984
Chicago!

5
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,116
About time we do a special here.

6
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,916
Before I say anything else, you guys,
a big hand for my friend,

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,502
the man, the myth, the legend.

8
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:29,006
Give it up for Martin!

9
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,432
The two guys you see standing next to him
are two of my oldest friends.

10
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,809
Not only are they friends,
they work for me.

11
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,729
That's Ivan and Tony.
Give Ivan and Tony a lot of love.

12
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,650
In addition to that--
This is so special right here.

13
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:51,445
Ladies and gentlemen,
handing me the microphone tonight

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,407
is the NFL's Coach of the Year...

15
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:02,372
and a former member
of the baddest football team that ever...

16
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,667
stepped on a field,

17
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:08,587
the 1985 Chicago Bears.

18
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:12,883
Coach Ron Rivera!

19
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,349
Thank you.

20
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,517
Thank you.

21
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,230
I gotta do it one time.

22
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,690
Da Bears.

23
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,783
I am super excited, you guys.
Let me tell you.

24
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:42,371
This is our 19th year
coming to Chicago, okay? Nineteen years.

25
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,419
The first time I came here,
I got a chance to meet some people,

26
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,422
and they says, "Gabriel,
have you ever been to Chicago?"

27
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:53,715
"No, it's my first time."

28
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,052
"We'd like to take you out to eat
if you're down."

29
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,720
And I'm like, "Well, hello.

30
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,473
I am very down."

31
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,520
They took me to a restaurant
called Portillo's.

32
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,029
You heard of it?

33
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,742
So we get there, and it was very good.

34
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:21,993
The hot dogs were delicious.

35
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,121
I had a chicken chopped salad.
It was amazing.

36
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,123
Had a beef dip. Really good.

37
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,584
But it wasn't until the meal
was almost over

38
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,753
that these new friends of mine said,

39
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,340
"We'd like you to try something
you might not have ever had before."

40
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,968
I'm like, "That's not likely."

41
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,763
I said, "What is it you want me to try?"

42
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:48,186
"They sell a thing at Portillo's
called a chocolate cake shake."

43
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,277
I said, "You had me at 'chocolate.'"

44
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,407
They said, "You gotta go up to the window
and order it from the lady."

45
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,619
So I get up and walk over to the lady.
She's like, "Can I help you?"

46
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,371
I say, "My friends are telling me

47
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:10,125
that I need to try this thing
called a chocolate cake shake."

48
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,419
"Okay. What size would you like?"

49
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,963
"How good is it?" "You want a large."

50
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,551
"All right. Can I please have
a large chocolate cake shake?"

51
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,763
"No problem."
I pay, and she turns around.

52
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:27,559
She turns around and walks over
to this refrigerator on the counter.

53
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:32,939
She opens it up, and she pulls out
a piece of chocolate cake.

54
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,818
I'm thinking to myself,
"She must've misunderstood what I said.

55
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,196
I didn't ask for
a piece of chocolate cake.

56
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,573
I asked for a chocolate cake shake."

57
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:46,536
She must've heard what I was thinking,
'cause she's walking by, like,

58
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,330
"It's gonna happen."

59
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,506
She walks over to the blender,
she takes the freaking lid off,

60
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:59,758
and she just looks at me and does this.

61
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,179
And I was like, "No!"

62
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,558
And she's like, "Oh, yeah."

63
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:17,609
She pours it and she hands me
this 44-ounce chocolate shake...

64
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:21,363
which is way more
than anybody should be drinking.

65
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,284
The straw was so thick,
you could almost fit your thumb in it.

66
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:31,206
So I grab the shake,
and I begin to attempt to drink it.

67
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:35,252
So I'm-- Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.

68
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,879
And I can see the shake coming up.
Mmm. Mmm.

69
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,219
And it hit, and then all of a sudden--

70
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,595
Whoo!

71
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,976
Hell, you guys even have taco trucks.

72
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,938
Now for anyone wondering
about taco trucks,

73
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,856
let me just let you know right now.

74
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,360
That is real good Mexican food.
I don't want you being concerned, like,

75
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:03,572
"No, there's wheels
under that restaurant."

76
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,658
Well, sometimes
we don't have a permit, okay?

77
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,036
But it doesn't mean the food is not good.

78
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,833
For me to know I'm gonna have
a good experience at a taco truck,

79
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,876
I always research.

80
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,878
I look to see who's running the truck.

81
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,047
For me to know I'm gonna have a good time,

82
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:25,427
I wanna make sure
that it's an all-female crew.

83
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:30,473
Not to sound sexist. It's just that
when it's all women running the truck,

84
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,475
they make me feel good about myself.

85
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,394
They make me feel special.

86
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,814
When I walk up at one o'clock
in the morning, and I have a buzz,

87
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,357
they make me feel good.

88
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,943
"Hello?"

89
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,486
They come to the window.

90
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,947
<i>"Hola, mi gordito. ¿Cómo estás?</i>

91
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,117
<i>¿Cómo está ese gordito chulito?</i>

92
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,869
<i>Ese gordito. Qué bonito.</i>

93
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:54,456
<i>A ver. A ver. Ojitos. Ojitos."</i>

94
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:00,337
I feel like a kid.
I'm like, "Can I have a taco?"

95
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,673
<i>"Whatever you want, mi hijito.
A taquito for you."</i>

96
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:09,804
Now, when it's an all Mexican male crew
running the truck--

97
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,934
It's late. They're tired. They're bitter.

98
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:17,938
Customer service isn't our strongest point
at one o'clock in the morning.

99
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,107
Then you gotta deal
with a drunk knucklehead like me.

100
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,738
"Hello?"
They come to the window.

101
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,617
<i>"¿Qué chingados quieres, pinche gordo?
What you want? What you want?"</i>

102
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,079
"Hey, what's up, bro? Can I have a taco?"

103
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,122
"Okay. What else?"

104
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,415
"That's it."

105
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,922
That's not even a word!

106
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,467
But you know
exactly what he just told you.

107
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,138
For some reason, Mexican people,
and only Mexican people,

108
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,849
have this sound that comes out of us

109
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,728
that can just discredit
anything you put in front of it.

110
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,232
It doesn't matter what it is.
We can kill it with that sound.

111
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,693
"I just graduated from college,
top of my class."

112
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,244
"Fine, I'll work at Burger King."

113
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,164
<i>"Papi, this is my fiancé. He loves me."</i>

114
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,502
"Fine, I'll be a whore."

115
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,635
And speaking of whores,
let me tell you where they put us up at.

116
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,640
That's a bad segue.

117
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,601
No. There's no whores at this hotel.
Listen.

118
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,229
I would like to personally thank
the promoters

119
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,649
for not only making this special happen,
but for taking really good care of us.

120
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,027
They put us at a hotel
right across the street.

121
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,031
And you know,
you know when you're in a good hotel

122
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,409
when you get inside of the elevator,
and it talks.

123
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,494
It's one of those.

124
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,663
"First floor."

125
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,750
"Second floor."

126
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,752
"Third floor."

127
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,004
I'm like, "Man, she sounds hot."

128
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,718
"Fourth floor. Mmmm."

129
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,473
"Fifth floor. Oh, yeah."

130
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,561
Martin asked me, "How far you going up?"
I said, "All the way."

131
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,441
I gotta see how this ends.
You know what I'm saying?

132
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,070
Oh, man.

133
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,572
And by the way,
since the last time we were here,

134
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,532
I've had a few things change in my life.

135
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,284
Some things happened that were so crazy

136
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,579
that I couldn't even believe
it was a possibility.

137
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:46,336
First thing that happened was,
I had my first ever celebrity death hoax.

138
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:52,050
Meaning that someone faked my death
on the Internet, and it went viral.

139
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:55,220
Someone wrote an amazing article

140
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,348
that was read by over 30 million people

141
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,143
that was so good, even I was like,
"Oh, my God. I was so nice."

142
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>TMZ reported it for 30 minutes,</i>

143
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,611
until they called my publicist
and confirmed that I was still alive.

144
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,491
The article said
that I had died October 31

145
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,619
from complications of Type II diabetes.

146
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,329
And I'm thinking to myself,

147
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,790
"That's a hell of a day
to kill a diabetic."

148
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,378
You know what I mean? That's like
killing Santa on Christmas Eve.

149
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,966
Thirty million people read this article.

150
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,759
No one thought to call me.

151
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,887
Except Martin.

152
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,473
-That's right.

153
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,937
Martin was the only one that called me.

154
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,816
And I think that was just to verify
that he still had employment.

155
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,530
I got that phone call.

156
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,408
"Hello?" Martin was like, "Hey.

157
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,035
You dead?"

158
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,706
"No, man. I'm good."

159
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,458
"I figured. You would've texted me."

160
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,712
And I would have,
'cause that's the kind of friend I am.

161
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,592
I even asked my son, Frankie.
I said, "Frankie, did you hear I died?"

162
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,468
"That's what they meant."

163
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,680
"What do you mean,
'That's what they meant'?"

164
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,267
"My friends were asking if you were okay."
"What'd you tell them?"

165
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,518
"I hadn't seen you."

166
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,606
"So apparently I died."

167
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:31,983
"Welcome back."

168
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,113
And that's another thing that's changed.

169
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:41,075
My son, Frankie, is now 18 years old.

170
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,330
And one week away from graduation.

171
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,167
Yeah.

172
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,213
You guys are clapping,
but he's not leaving.

173
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,301
I asked him. "Frankie,
what do you want to do with your life?"

174
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,636
"Mm-mmm."

175
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,222
"Have you thought about college?"
"Just now."

176
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:07,560
I'm like, "Frankie, you do realize
that all you need to do is get accepted.

177
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:12,148
I tell a lot of jokes. I will pay
for your entire college education,

178
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,068
no matter where you want to go."

179
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,115
"As long as you get accepted.
What do you think about that?"

180
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,325
"Mm-mmm."

181
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,412
I say, "You want to go to school
in California, we'll make it happen.

182
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,873
You want to go out of state,
we'll make it happen.

183
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:32,710
Hell, I'll even do
one of those international programs."

184
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,879
The ones where you give them
one of your children

185
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,256
and they give you one of their children.

186
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,635
-What is it called when you kid-swap?
-Exchange.

187
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,845
Thank you. Sorry.
That's right. "Exchange."

188
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,223
Some of you were like,
"That's called human trafficking."

189
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,895
Different program.

190
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,858
I would love to do an exchange program
with my son.

191
00:12:55,942 --> 00:12:57,527
But don't give me a regular kid.

192
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,654
If I'm gonna do an exchange program,

193
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,700
give me a kid from a hard-core
third world country,

194
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:09,622
so he appreciates all the basic things
most American children take for granted.

195
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,090
That's why I say give me little Tombutu.

196
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:24,220
Give me Tombutu. I would love Tombutu,
and Tombutu would love me.

197
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,973
"Mister Fluffy?" "Yes, Tombutu?"

198
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,935
"I was wondering,
what time do we go to sleep?"

199
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:34,063
"You go to sleep whenever you like.
This is your room.

200
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,065
We sleep next door."

201
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,280
"All of this is for Tombutu?"

202
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:44,741
"Yes, all of this is for Tombutu."

203
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:49,537
"In my village, two families sleep
in an area this big."

204
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,207
"Well, here in America,
one big-ass Mexican kid sleeps right here.

205
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,626
Enjoy."

206
00:13:56,419 --> 00:14:00,256
Then I would take him to IHOP or Denny's
and let him order whatever he wants

207
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,550
and just watch him lose it.

208
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,888
"This is the Thanksgiving I heard of!
Thank you, Mr. Fluffy! Thank you!

209
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,850
If there is anything Tombutu can do
for you, please tell me. Anything."

210
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,560
"Can you help me take out the trash?"

211
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,188
"For you, I will eat the trash."

212
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:21,736
Meanwhile, my son's on the other side
of the world,

213
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,863
on top of an elephant,
trying to get Wi-Fi.

214
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,329
I love my son very much, you guys.

215
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,874
It's just that sometimes he doesn't get
the position he's in.

216
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,084
He doesn't realize it.

217
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,128
Which is why I love it
whenever he brings his friends over.

218
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,838
He brings his friends over the house,

219
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,716
and they're constantly saying
what I'm saying.

220
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,052
And as a parent,
anytime you tell your kids something,

221
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,303
that's one thing.

222
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,765
When you can get their friends to say
what you say, you can't pay for that.

223
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,394
And they're always doing it.
"Frankie, you're lucky, man.

224
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,229
Your dad's trying to help you
go to college.

225
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,897
My dad wants me to get a job.

226
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,400
Frankie, you're lucky, man.
Your dad's trying to give you a car.

227
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,235
My dad doesn't even trust me to walk.

228
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,611
You're lucky, man."

229
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,199
And I hear this, and I'm like,
"I love these kids."

230
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,122
Because my son is very numb
to this situation.

231
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:18,292
He's very numb to all of you,
and he's very numb to "Fluffy."

232
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:23,548
Okay, he doesn't see Fluffy.
He sees "Dad! Dad!"

233
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,925
I'm Dad. I'm the guy that tells him
clean your room,

234
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,593
take a shower and put on deodorant,

235
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,221
<i>which he does very well now!</i>

236
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,980
But you guys saw what I had to do
to make that happen.

237
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,484
His friends, on the other hand,
they still get excited when they see me.

238
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:44,861
They still geek out.

239
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,447
I walk into the living room.
They're all sitting there.

240
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,532
Frankie sees me. "Hey, Dad."

241
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,660
His friends see me, they see this.

242
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,381
With, like, doves.

243
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,844
Can you imagine if every time
you walked into a room, that happened?

244
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,220
"He's here."

245
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,901
Ladies, imagine if your partner
could do that for you. Huh?

246
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,112
It's your anniversary, a celebration,
some magical moment,

247
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,198
or you're just laying there
and you're drunk.

248
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:35,745
And you're just like, "What are you gonna
do to me? What are you gonna do?"

249
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,049
One extra dove.

250
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:59,560
And by the way, guys,
if you're ever able to pull off the doves,

251
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:01,270
just leave it at that.

252
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,690
Don't try to top the doves.
It's very hard to top the doves.

253
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,485
Don't start running your mouth
and talking smack.

254
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,195
She's laying there. Don't start:

255
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:12,573
"You don't know what's gonna happen
to you. You're gonna get it."

256
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:16,285
Don't do that. 'Cause ladies,
all you have to do is look at him and go,

257
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,712
Anyways, back to my son's friends.

258
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,883
So my son has two friends
that come to the house all the time.

259
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,470
One friend, his name is Ken.
Works a lot with computers.

260
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,557
The other friend, his name is Fabian.
He wants to be a police officer.

261
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,809
Both of these kids are really good.

262
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,312
Now I keep calling everyone kids,
even though they're all 18.

263
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,524
But to me, they're kids. I'm almost 40.
I'm like, "Uh," you know?

264
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,278
Some of the conversations we have
are very adult-like.

265
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,823
And the other conversations, I'm like,
"What am I doing with my life?"

266
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,702
For example, at home--
At home, when I'm hanging out,

267
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,788
I usually just wear very similar to now,
except the Hawaiian shirt.

268
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,001
I usually wear a T-shirt
that has Star Wars or Marvel Comics

269
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,461
or Transformers on it.

270
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,674
Cartoons. I like wearing stuff like that
around the house.

271
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:15,386
One day, I'm wearing a T-shirt
that has The Avengers on the front.

272
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,681
Yeah. And I walk into the living room,

273
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,559
and my son's friend Fabian
sees me wearing the shirt.

274
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,145
So he starts pointing.
I'm like, "What's up, dude?"

275
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,731
He goes--
"Weak."

276
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:28,733
"'scuse me?"

277
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,151
"Weak."

278
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,445
And then he says, "DC's better."

279
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,197
"What did you say?"

280
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,449
"DC's better."

281
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,328
I'm like, "DC's okay. Obama lives there.
They pass laws.

282
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,204
They got hotels, historic museums.

283
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,707
It's not a real state. I don't know
why you're getting cray-cray."

284
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,751
He goes, "No, fool! DC Comics!"

285
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,211
I'm like, "Hey, man.
I'm almost 40. I don't care.

286
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:53,841
It's just a really cool shirt. I like it.
It fits... No big deal."

287
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,843
"That's 'cause they are."
"You need to relax."

288
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:56,677
"They're the best."

289
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,637
"You need to chill."

290
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,681
And in my head, I'm like,
why am I having this conversation?

291
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,933
I have better things to do,

292
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,603
like trying to get my son on an elephant,
but no.

293
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:09,732
The kid in me is, "Why are they best?"
He points at the shirt again.

294
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,610
"Iron Man sucks. Batman's number one."

295
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,822
I go, "Why?" "'Cause he is."
I go, "That's not an argument.

296
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,949
First of all,
Batman's not the best superhero.

297
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,118
I hate to break it to you. He's not."

298
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,205
I can hear people getting ready to boo.

299
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,833
"Oh, no, Fluffy. Don't go there.
Don't go there, Fluffy. Don't do it."

300
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,502
Yes, I'm gonna do this. Watch this.

301
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:33,673
Batman's not the best superhero.
Batman is the creepiest superhero.

302
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:39,095
Batman is the creepiest superhero
that has ever lived.

303
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,013
He even sounds creepy.

304
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,224
"I'm Batman."

305
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,142
"I'm Batman."

306
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:46,644
You don't recognize that voice?

307
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,688
"Want some candy?"

308
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,566
"Help me find my puppy."

309
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:57,196
Hello? He only comes out
at night. His face is always covered up.

310
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,116
He's always waiting in alleys.
And who does he talk to?

311
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,035
A guy named Joker, a guy named Riddler.
His name is Batman.

312
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,204
Joker, Riddler, Batman.
Joker, Riddler, Batman.

313
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,581
Those are Mexican gang member names.

314
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,422
Can you imagine if that was
Batman's real identity?

315
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,924
At night.
"I'm Batman."

316
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,092
During the day.

317
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,970
<i>"No, chingue su madre, soy Batman, loco--</i>

318
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:24,014
<i>Todo el pinche dÃ­a aquÃ­ trabajando
y luego le parta la madre Joker--"</i>

319
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:25,641
"I'm Batman."

320
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,937
I said, "All right, Fabian,
Mr. Batman's The Best.'

321
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,149
Based on my T-shirt--
My T-shirt says Marvel Comics.

322
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,319
I see Thor, I see Captain America,
I see Iron Man.

323
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,614
Who are some of the superheroes
that DC Comics has

324
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,617
that makes them better than Marvel? Go."

325
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,121
"Batman." "You said that."
"Superman." "That's a good one."

326
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,622
"Wonder Woman." "Okay."

327
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,791
"Green Lantern." "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."

328
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:57,047
I said, "I know the other superheroes,
but Green Lantern?

329
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,341
What's his power?"

330
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,553
"He wears a ring,
and the ring gives him power."

331
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,846
I said, "That's a fantasy.

332
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,224
I don't know any man who wears a ring
who has power."

333
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:17,943
And if you're not clapping right now,
my point exactly.

334
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,282
You can't clap, can you? You can't.

335
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,867
You know why you can't clap?

336
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,203
'Cause you're sitting next to Kryptonite.

337
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,422
He's not even clapping.
He's like, "No, no, no, no.

338
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,675
<i>No. Me pega Wonder Woman. No, no."</i>

339
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,807
Listen, I'm not gonna lie.

340
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,102
Sometimes-- Sometimes I feel just a pinch,

341
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,854
a pinch like a superhero,

342
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,650
in the sense that I'm able to walk out
in front of large groups of people,

343
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,152
change people's moods, make people smile,

344
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,780
make people laugh,
make people feel a little bit better.

345
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,657
-Right?

346
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:10,704
By that same token, like any superhero,
I have my weaknesses too.

347
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,249
I come out here and I make you happy.

348
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,875
And then I go home.

349
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,878
And I piss off one person.

350
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,508
'Cause she don't want to hear about this.
She doesn't want to hear about you guys.

351
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:26,262
I can't go home and brag.
"Baby, it was crazy in Chicago."

352
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,180
"That's nice. Take out the trash."

353
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,977
"But they were clapping
and chanting my name."

354
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,812
"Oh, is that gonna help? Okay.

355
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,773
Take out the trash!
Take out the trash!

356
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:40,985
Take out the trash! Take out the trash!"

357
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,367
"But they told me they loved me!"

358
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,811
Fluffy! Fluffy! Fluffy!

359
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,484
Oh, my God.

360
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,533
Do you guys have any idea
how hard it's gonna be

361
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:31,452
to go home and take out the trash now?

362
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,122
Thank you.

363
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,374
Oh, my God. This is awesome!

364
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,668
I hear some of you too.
You guys okay over there?

365
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,755
That's a big compliment, by the way.

366
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:47,509
Anytime I hear people in the arena,
and they're freaking--

367
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,679
That lets me know
I'm making you laugh so much,

368
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,725
your own body is rejecting
the activity that you're participating in.

369
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,894
Your own lungs are telling you,

370
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,480
"This is not good for you.
You need to leave."

371
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,566
But you're stubborn. You're like,
"No! The ticket was expensive!"

372
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,904
That's usually from guys.

373
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,822
From women, it's a little bit different.

374
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:14,411
Anytime I hear women laughing so much
that they begin to snort.

375
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:19,416
You're already laughing. That tells me
I'm making you laugh so much,

376
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,379
I'm causing you to inhale and exhale
at the same time,

377
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,673
forcing you to make that--

378
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,760
And if I hear a woman snort
more than two times,

379
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,554
that tells me
I made you pee just a little.

380
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,316
I love that.
You were pointing out the whole time.

381
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,151
She's like, "You asshole."

382
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:49,113
Thanks for having my back.

383
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,825
Another thing
that I now consider a compliment

384
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,785
is that from time to time,

385
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:59,248
I have people who are experiencing
their first ever comedy event,

386
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,877
and they're not accustomed to laughing
for long periods of time.

387
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:08,048
And they get so excited
and so involved with the show,

388
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,842
that they forget.

389
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,053
They forget to do a very basic thing.

390
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,930
Called breathing!

391
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:19,685
You'd be amazed how many times
I've seen this in the front row.

392
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,024
And they pass the hell out.

393
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,446
The messed-up part is
only I can see what's happening.

394
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,866
And-- And they're usually, like,
"Fluffy, do something."

395
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,326
I'm, like-- "Do something!"

396
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,254
"He woke up! Thank you!"

397
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,426
I had a lady one time...

398
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,678
up in the balcony...

399
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,473
who laughed herself unconscious.

400
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,558
She went forward

401
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,770
and wound up hitting her head
on the rail that was in the aisle.

402
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,606
Now I couldn't see this
because I'm onstage

403
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,983
and I had spotlights in my face.

404
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,818
It wasn't until after the show was over,

405
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:13,238
when Martin came back out onstage
and he took the microphone.

406
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:16,992
Then he tells me in my ear, "Bro,
some lady just got hurt in the balcony.

407
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,162
The paramedics are here. They have her
in the lobby. Let's check on her."

408
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,079
I'm like, "Let's go."

409
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:25,459
So we go behind the curtain.
Security is waiting for us with the car.

410
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,504
So we jump in the car--

411
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,089
They raced us around
to the front of the building.

412
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,593
Now as soon as we get to the front,
we see an ambulance.

413
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,553
We start walking in.

414
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:40,474
And now-- Not to take anything away
from this serious moment,

415
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,309
because this really did happen.

416
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,687
It's a little bit funny
in the sense that...

417
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,777
my show just finished, and people
are now starting to leave the building.

418
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,448
They just saw me onstage a minute ago.
Now they see me walking in the front door.

419
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,577
You gotta see it through my eyes.

420
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,964
"He's big, but he's fast. I don't know
how he did that one. That's pretty good."

421
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,969
I come in, and immediately I cut right,

422
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,639
to where the lady and the paramedics
are sitting on the steps to the balcony.

423
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,808
The lobby is starting to fill up
with people.

424
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,103
I'm trying to get from point A
to point B without getting stopped.

425
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,688
So I started doing this,

426
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,649
and I know it's gonna look a little weird,
but it worked.

427
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:34,278
"Are you okay? Are you all right?"

428
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,655
People see me doing this,
and immediately they're puzzled.

429
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,740
The way you looked at me now, like that.

430
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,118
And they did this.
"What the hell's he doing?"

431
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,121
It made everybody take two steps back
and do like this.

432
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,665
It created a hole for me to get to them.

433
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,127
Then they see the paramedics,
and they realize what I was trying to do.

434
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,671
Everything was fine
till I got really close.

435
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,340
And then one of the paramedics
calls me out.

436
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:56,884
"What are you doing to the lady?"

437
00:27:56,967 --> 00:28:00,345
I go, "Listen, sir. The woman
obviously sustained a head injury.

438
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,724
I'm giving her a chance to process
the fact that it's really me.

439
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:04,725
And I'm slowly...

440
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,855
getting closer to her.

441
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,025
I realize now
that I'm in this incredible position

442
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:16,862
where I can no longer walk up
from behind someone at one of my shows

443
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,614
and go, 'Hey!'"

444
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:22,117
"Why not?" "Cause then-- 'Clear!'"

445
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,245
"Fluffy killed another one."

446
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,707
So finally the lady looks up.

447
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,919
She must have been 55, 60,
little Asian woman.

448
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,295
She sees me, and she's, like--

449
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,133
"You too funny.

450
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,472
You almost a-kill me!"

451
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,684
"I am so sorry. Are you okay?

452
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,811
Is there anything I could do
to make you feel better?"

453
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,980
"Yes.

454
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:54,149
Yes, feel better.

455
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,485
I would like two T-shirt."

456
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,279
"I'm gonna get you two T-shirts."

457
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:02,074
"And two DVD."

458
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,077
I'm like, "You're not that hurt.
Get your ass over here."

459
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,374
So I stand her up, and immediately
one of the paramedics--

460
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,376
"Hey. She hit her head.
She shouldn't be standing."

461
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,295
I said, "I'm the artist
performing here tonight.

462
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,924
I accept full responsibility
over this woman. I got her. It's cool."

463
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,883
Plus, she's tiny.

464
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,345
We're only walking ten feet
to the merchandise table. No big deal.

465
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,389
I say, "Come on. I got you. Let's go."

466
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:29,685
As soon as we start walking,
she starts venting.

467
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:38,944
"Mr. Fluffy. You have no idea
kind of week I have.

468
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,114
My son, he marry this girl.

469
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,157
She no cook, no clean.

470
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,034
Move into my house.

471
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:48,829
Now I have to cook and clean for two.

472
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,372
Oh, some bullshit."

473
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:56,044
And I'm like, "Oh, my God.
That's gonna happen to me."

474
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,467
"Mr. Fluffy, I must apologize to you

475
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:07,431
because I do not know who you are
until today.

476
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:10,225
I have a friend who give me ticket.

477
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,438
She say, 'Susie, you stress so much.
You need to get out.

478
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:18,442
Husband win ticket in raffle.
Only have one ticket. You take it.'

479
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:22,195
So I look at the ticket.
Ticket say, 'The Fluffy.'

480
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,076
I don't know what comedy show is
because I never go comedy show.

481
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,830
<i>I see 'Fluffy,'
I think is musical like Cats.</i>

482
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:37,127
I say, 'Okay. I go see Fluffy Cats.'

483
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:42,883
So I come here early
so I can get the popcorn and the soda.

484
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,761
So I sit and I wait for Fluffy Cats.

485
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:49,723
Next thing I know, your friend Martin,

486
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,602
he walk out onstage with the big hair,
big goatee.

487
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:58,523
<i>I say, 'Oh, ho, ho. This not Cats.
This not Cats.</i>

488
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,359
<i>This Lion King.</i>

489
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,823
That's a Mexican Mufasa.'

490
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:13,080
And he start crack jokes.
I start laugh, laugh. I laugh.

491
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,957
Then you come out onstage. I cannot take.

492
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,293
I can't breathe. I black out.

493
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:22,714
And when I wake up, I have ice pack
on the head, blood in the eye,

494
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,676
and the two young white paramedics,
they both touch me right here.

495
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,973
They say, 'Are you okay?
Are you okay? Are you okay?'"

496
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,559
"What did you tell them?"
"Ho-ho. 'Never better.'

497
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:43,318
Susie never have two young white men
touch me right here, same time.

498
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:47,197
Oh, your show very special, Mr. Fluffy.
Very special.

499
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,199
You show like Make-A-Wish.

500
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,121
If I have a scar--"

501
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,414
"You're gonna sue me."

502
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:58,125
"No. No, no, no, no, no. No!

503
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,835
Not going to sue.

504
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:04,631
If I have a scar, and the friends ask me,

505
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,342
'Hey. How you get scar?'...

506
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,138
now I have great story to tell.

507
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:16,226
I'm going to say--
'Two white men, same time.'

508
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,943
While Mexican watch."

509
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,575
I get her back to the paramedics.
The paramedics are like,

510
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,493
"She's a handful, huh?

511
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,371
I'm like, "Oh, yeah. She's horny.
She likes you. Here you go."

512
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,417
As soon as I turn around,

513
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,254
all I see is a lobby full of people
and a bunch of cell phones.

514
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,256
There's footage of what
I just told you out there.

515
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,925
Everybody was recording what happened.
What I thought was cool

516
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:51,887
is everybody waited for me to finish
with the lady and the paramedics.

517
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,389
All of a sudden, when I turned around--

518
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:55,599
People started coming up.

519
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,477
Some people wanted to shake my hand,
some people wanted to high-five.

520
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,647
One guy just wanted to hug me,
and he didn't say anything.

521
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,608
He just hugged me, just-- "Are you okay?"

522
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,238
"You sure?"
"All right."

523
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:11,948
Couple of kids are looking at me, like--

524
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:18,288
And for me, I thought that was so cute,
because I recognized that twinkle.

525
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,123
I've looked at someone like that before.

526
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,334
I've been starstruck many, many times.

527
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:26,087
As a matter of fact, this past year,
I got to meet one of my childhood heroes.

528
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,256
I got to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger.

529
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,595
Now some of you are clapping,
some of you are like, "Wait, wait, wait."

530
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:36,848
Here's the thing.
I didn't love him as a politician,

531
00:33:36,932 --> 00:33:40,018
and I was too young
to know him as a bodybuilder.

532
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,604
<i>All I knew was
The Terminator was my favorite movie,</i>

533
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,022
and he was the Terminator.

534
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:48,860
So, here's the story.

535
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:53,240
I'm in LA, at this red carpet event
for some movie I still haven't seen.

536
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,118
I'm standing there
with my publicist, okay?

537
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,578
I'm standing there with my publicist,

538
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,790
and she's explaining to me
how the red carpet works.

539
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,459
"Listen, Gabriel.
This is what's gonna happen.

540
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,127
You're gonna go down the red carpet,

541
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,922
and then the paparazzi's gonna start
taking photos of you,

542
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,882
and then someone's gonna
ask you some questions.

543
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,094
It's a lot of fun. Then we'll go inside,
and we'll go to the after-party.

544
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,345
It's gonna be great."

545
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,055
As she's telling me this,
I'm looking around,

546
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,057
and I look over and I notice--

547
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,934
I see him. I see Arnold Schwarzenegger.

548
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,519
And I freak out.

549
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,357
"It's Arnold Schwarzenegger!
It's Arnold Schwarzenegger!"

550
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,361
"Relax. Relax. You've never met Arnie?"

551
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,905
I said, "No, I've never met Arnie."

552
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,411
"I work with him all the time.
He's really nice.

553
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,621
Would you like me to introduce you?"

554
00:34:41,705 --> 00:34:43,707
I'm like, "Yes!"

555
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:49,337
She takes me by the hand,
and she walks me directly to Arnold.

556
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:52,173
I'm freaking out so bad.
I look like a big-ass toddler.

557
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,431
We get over
to Arnold Schwarzenegger's area.

558
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,765
He's Arnold Schwarzenegger.

559
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:04,269
He's already got a big group of people
around him, waiting to take a photo.

560
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,438
So I'm just patiently waiting.

561
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,232
As I'm watching him, you guys--
I gotta tell you right now.

562
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:16,239
No one on this planet is better at
meeting people than Arnold Schwarzenegger.

563
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:19,492
He is the greatest people-meeter
I've ever witnessed.

564
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:24,289
The reason I say this is because
when you meet him, he's very engaging.

565
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,291
He grabs your hand. He pulls you in.

566
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:29,628
He looks at you in the eyes
and he turns it on.

567
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:35,425
When you meet Arnold, you get
exactly what you think you're gonna get.

568
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:36,926
It's awesome to watch.

569
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,346
"How are you? So nice to meet you.

570
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,848
You so strong. You pump iron?
Ay! Look at you!

571
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,268
This is incredible,
got these lights and this red carpet.

572
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,436
'scuse me. How are you?

573
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,065
Ay! You so strong! You pump iron?
This is incredible. Look at you."

574
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:53,443
People are walking away from him,
looking at their hand.

575
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,198
They're looking at their hand, you guys.

576
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,159
Ten minutes I'm watching
Arnold Schwarzenegger light people up.

577
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,911
Then I notice something else.

578
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:08,667
I notice that Arnold has a handler,
a guy who stands right behind him.

579
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,960
And it's this guy's job

580
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:15,924
to basically reset Arnold
for the next person he's about to meet.

581
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:20,470
Arnold Schwarzenegger will never cut off
a conversation with a fan.

582
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,348
The guy behind him listens in
on the conversation,

583
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,433
and he determines when enough is enough,

584
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,603
and then he signals Arnold
to cut it off and move on.

585
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,938
Here's the signal.

586
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,942
He grabs the back of Arnold's arm,
right there, two times. One, two.

587
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:38,738
That lets Arnold know: cut it off,
time to move on. Always to the left.

588
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:39,864
Awesome to watch.

589
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,243
"This is incredible with these lights
and these special effects going on here.

590
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,286
'scuse me. How are you? Nice to meet you.

591
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,038
You so strong. Ay!"

592
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:48,832
I'm, like--

593
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,961
So I yell out to the handler, "Hey!"
And the handler turns around.

594
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,631
"Hit him! I wanna meet him! Hit him!"

595
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,426
And he starts laughing
because now he sees that I see

596
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,136
how the Terminator is really working.

597
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,431
So he gives me one of these.

598
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:10,103
Next thing you know,
he is lighting Arnold up.

599
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:14,274
He is hitting Arnold so fast,
Arnold can barely keep up.

600
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,692
"'scuse me. Pardon me. How are you?

601
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,361
'scuse me. Pardon me.
High five. High five.

602
00:37:18,445 --> 00:37:23,199
'scuse me. Hello. How are you?
Pound, pound, pound pound."

603
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,161
He's coming down the line, coming down
the line, and I'm just waiting.

604
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,248
I stick my hand out, and he grabbed it.

605
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,625
"How are you? So--

606
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,920
I recognize you.

607
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,465
I know who you are.

608
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:42,927
You're that comedian who does the joke
about the Indian man trying to rob a bank,

609
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:46,097
but he cannot rob the bank
because they are making fun of him."

610
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,853
And in my head, I'm, like--
"He knows me!"

611
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,275
Outside, I'm like, "Yeah, that's me."

612
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,652
"You are hysterical.
Give me your contact information.

613
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:01,613
You are the funniest person-- 'scuse me.

614
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,574
How are you? Nice to meet you.
You so strong."

615
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,034
"Hey!"

616
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,330
Meeting Arnold
is like a really good roller coaster.

617
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,333
You want to go to the end
and meet him one more time.

618
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:18,171
It was so cool because I'm watching him--
And people started recording him.

619
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,839
For me, it's one of those things

620
00:38:19,923 --> 00:38:23,635
where I'm finding myself
in a very interesting situation right now,

621
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,388
because I like hanging out,
I like going out.

622
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:30,934
I've been drunk in Chicago
many, many times.

623
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,394
I like to have fun.

624
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,232
Here's the problem.

625
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:41,152
I recently signed a contract
with ABC Television

626
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,656
in hopes of producing
my very own sitcom for TV.

627
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,539
It's not a guarantee,
but I am guaranteed a pilot.

628
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,666
Here's the problem.

629
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,212
ABC is owned... by Disney.

630
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,924
Disney is such a huge brand

631
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:07,428
that anytime someone threatens
the way you look at that brand,

632
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,765
they are dealt with
in a very un-Disney-like way.

633
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:14,936
This sitcom that I'm producing
is about me.

634
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,772
I play myself. I play Gabriel Iglesias.

635
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,024
It's about me, my family, my friends.

636
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:22,068
My friend Martin...

637
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,404
is not allowed on the show.

638
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,284
Not per me. Take it up with the Mouse.

639
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:34,789
They look at your social media.
They look at your stuff online.

640
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,166
If there's anything about you
that doesn't fit that model,

641
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,127
they will freaking-- mmmm.

642
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,130
And I'm paranoid, because Disney's so big.
They're so huge.

643
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,591
They own television stations.
They own radio stations.

644
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:48,136
They own Marvel Comics.
They own Star Wars.

645
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,221
I don't need that phone call, you know?

646
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:52,348
"Hello?"

647
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,601
"Mmm. Fucked up, you did."

648
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,696
I'm so freaking paranoid, you guys.

649
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,490
Because nowadays,
people are always recording.

650
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,826
If you do something
that might look stupid,

651
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,704
it can end up turning out even worse.

652
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:19,042
For example, say I fall off the stage
tonight and someone's recording that.

653
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:22,045
<i>If TMZ gets ahold of that,
it can go viral.</i>

654
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,590
And God forbid, something happens to me,
it can make the news.

655
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,259
"We're standing here
in front of the Allstate Arena

656
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,302
in Rosemont, Illinois,

657
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,055
where authorities believe
Fluffy lost control.

658
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:36,976
The 39-year-old comedian was found dead
for the second time in two years.

659
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:40,647
No one knows exactly
what happened here tonight.

660
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,106
Authorities had this to say."

661
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,834
That's why I'm saying I gotta be careful,

662
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,545
because I still enjoy my habits.

663
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,713
I still like drinking.

664
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,715
Of course, some people
pull me aside and say,

665
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,094
"Gabriel, why do you drink?
Why do you drink?

666
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,722
You have so many responsibilities
and people you take care of.

667
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:15,723
Why do you drink?"

668
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:19,227
"Because I have a lot of responsibilities
and people to take care of."

669
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,399
Some of you already know because
you've been to my shows in the past.

670
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,902
My poison of choice is tequila.

671
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,575
Certain alcohol
I no longer mess with anymore.

672
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,494
Like, I no longer mess with JÃ¤ger.

673
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,791
See, first of all, any alcohol
that will make you say its name...

674
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,418
is not safe.

675
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,504
That's the only alcohol
that will make you do that.

676
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,840
That's the only one you hear people--

677
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,758
"Jäger!"

678
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,011
You don't hear anyone else.
You don't hear Mexicans--

679
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,846
<i>"Tequila! Güey!"</i>

680
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,807
You don't hear black people--
"Hennessy, playa."

681
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:02,478
You don't hear Japanese--
"Whoo! Sake! Sake!"

682
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,690
JÃ¤ger is scary for a few reasons.

683
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:09,819
One, I'm Type II diabetic.
I shouldn't even be drinking.

684
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:12,447
But JÃ¤ger has twice as much sugar in it.

685
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,616
Second thing is the consistency.
It's very sticky.

686
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,118
It's like cough syrup.

687
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,163
So if you drink too much of it,
it holds on longer than anything else.

688
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,081
And it's nasty. When you drink it,
you're, like--

689
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,793
<i>Pa la tos. Pa la tos.</i>

690
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:27,170
It's horrible.

691
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:33,634
If you drink too much of it,
it holds on longer than anything else.

692
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,345
You know? If you have one too many beers,
you know what happens.

693
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,223
You get the--
Then you return it to the rightful owner.

694
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,728
JÃ¤ger makes you feel like
you gotta bring it back, but you can't.

695
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:47,732
All it does it make you dramatic
for 45 minutes until it lets go.

696
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,650
You've seen someone like that.
"Hey, you okay?"

697
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,152
"I'm fine, bro--"

698
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,204
They can't throw up.
All they're doing is six-minute abs.

699
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,298
People look at you the next day.
"Are you into fitness?" "No, I'm a drunk."

700
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,843
Man, JÃ¤ger is scary.

701
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,888
Another alcohol
I refuse to mess with anymore...

702
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:20,932
is wine.

703
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:23,768
Look at the people--

704
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,396
"We're from Schaumburg."

705
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:37,573
Those of you that don't know,

706
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:40,576
Schaumburg is the Beverly Hills
of the area, so--

707
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,662
I'm sure you figured that out.

708
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:46,999
Um-- My issue with wine is very simple.

709
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:50,253
I don't like the fact
that wine is socially accepted.

710
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:53,798
What I mean by that is that if you see
someone with a bottle of wine,

711
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,343
if you see a guy crossing the street
with a bottle of wine,

712
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,680
immediately he's judged,
but in a positive way,

713
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,349
because wine is always associated
with something high-class,

714
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:04,976
something positive, something progressive,

715
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,186
an anniversary, a celebration,
a promotion.

716
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:10,231
So you try to figure it out.
"What do you think is going on over there?

717
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,067
Graduation? Promotion? It's gotta be good.

718
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:14,610
Hey, good for you, buddy."

719
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,866
Women see a man with a bottle of wine,
holding a couple of glasses,

720
00:44:19,949 --> 00:44:21,033
and immediately--

721
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,372
Lucky bitch."

722
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:31,419
It's still alcohol.

723
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,379
It will still mess you up.

724
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,256
The main reason why I don't like wine

725
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,426
is because
you cannot accurately measure wine.

726
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,179
You can measure real liquor.
It's called a shot.

727
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:42,930
And you know after drinking enough times

728
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,474
what you can handle
and what you can't handle.

729
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,185
Because people who drink a lot

730
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,979
love to brag
about their drinking abilities.

731
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,356
-They have their drinking number. Right?

732
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,317
They have their drinking number.

733
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,319
You'll hear 'em, you know.

734
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:59,363
"Eleven shots of Don Julio. Whoo! Yeah!"

735
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,367
They have their drinking number,
even women.

736
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:07,371
"After four shots of Cuervo, I am so good.

737
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,499
Four shots is my sweet spot."

738
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,045
"What happens if you do five?"
"I'll wake up in an alley."

739
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,007
"What happens if you do six?"
"That's how I met Tyrone."

740
00:45:25,598 --> 00:45:29,268
See, with wine you cannot accurately
measure how much you're drinking

741
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:30,853
unless you're basing it on the bottle.

742
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:34,023
And if you're basing it on the bottle,
then that's a whole different issue.

743
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,568
With wine,
the glasses are always different sizes.

744
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,696
Sometimes they're big glasses.
Sometimes they're small glasses.

745
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,991
And a lot of times you need
to rely on someone to pour it for you.

746
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,077
Sometimes they know what they're doing.
Sometimes they don't.

747
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,413
Sometimes they fill it up too high,
which is not the proper amount.

748
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,875
Sometimes they get it just right, which is
a little bit less than half of the glass.

749
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,461
Sometimes you get that greedy bastard
from Olive Garden.

750
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,088
You get that little sample.

751
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:59,715
You have to hold it up
in direct sunlight and do this.

752
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:03,970
Then you drink it. "That's pretty good.
I got a coupon. Here you go."

753
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:12,311
And you never see wine drinkers
drinking with real drinkers in dive bars.

754
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:16,649
You might see 'em at a social gathering
like this one or some corporate function,

755
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,651
but never at a little hole in the wall.

756
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,070
You'll never see-- "Jäger!"

757
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,822
<i>"Tequila! Güey!"</i>

758
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,324
And in the middle--
"Merlot, I say.

759
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,870
Oh, this is a fantastic establishment.
I truly enjoy the decor here.

760
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:30,871
This is amazing.

761
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:34,000
This is brilliant, I tell you.
Who cuts your grass?

762
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,502
It's fantastic."

763
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,840
I'm sorry. That voice
always makes me laugh. I like it.

764
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,509
It makes me smile, you know,
when we're here...

765
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,094
in America.

766
00:46:45,845 --> 00:46:48,180
Whenever I travel
and I perform in England,

767
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:49,807
-that voice takes on a different meaning.
-Whoo!

768
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:53,352
I heard a "whoo."
Do we have people from the UK?

769
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,064
All right. Let me tell
the rest of the people about you.

770
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:03,070
I love it whenever people from the UK
come here to the United States,

771
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:05,531
because when we hear you speak,

772
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,783
you sound incredible, you sound amazing,

773
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,744
you sound educated,

774
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,662
you sound inspirational.

775
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:15,291
That accent is so proper. It is so proper.

776
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,209
It doesn't matter
what you're talking about,

777
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,503
we're drawn to whatever it is.

778
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:21,756
You could be talking about trash,
it sounds amazing.

779
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,884
"Who could leave all this rubbish here?
This is such a travesty.

780
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,678
This is-- All this destruction here
all over the sidewalk.

781
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:30,222
Someone must tend to this at once.
This is ridiculous."

782
00:47:30,306 --> 00:47:31,348
People are listening in.

783
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:34,518
"I don't know what happened
over there, but the shit hit the fan.

784
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,773
That guy from England is pissed.
I don't know.

785
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,274
What the hell is 'rubbish'?"

786
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,988
See, it's very different.
Now, when one of us goes over there,

787
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,823
man, it's very, very different,

788
00:47:47,907 --> 00:47:50,242
because, see,
we don't sound the same as them.

789
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:51,619
As a matter of fact,

790
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,706
as Americans, we have a certain way
with the English language.

791
00:47:55,790 --> 00:48:00,044
Do you understand how we sound to them?

792
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:04,381
I mean, seriously, do you know how they
look at us when they hear us speak?

793
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,926
We sound like this to them:

794
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,346
"I'll tell you,
the other day I was hanging out with Phil.

795
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,140
That sumbitch come over to the house.
We had ourselves a good old time.

796
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,350
Just me and Phil."

797
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,771
By the way, if you sound like that
here tonight, I'm kidding.

798
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,481
They're just jokes.

799
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,691
Don't feel like just, you know,

800
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,276
"I'm-a wait for his ass outside.

801
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,863
I'll see how funny he is when he gets
to the parking lot. Fluffy, my ass."

802
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,453
I just think it's funny...

803
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:38,040
that, no matter what they talk about
over there,

804
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,250
they sound the same.

805
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,210
It sounds the same, you know.

806
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,963
Whereas with us, Americans,

807
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:46,924
we speak according to our environment.

808
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,677
We change it up. We morph. We adapt.

809
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,970
We all have our--

810
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:55,724
For example, we all have
our "trying to get a good job" voice.

811
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,603
When you walk in for that interview,
you don't sound the way you sound

812
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:02,064
on a Saturday night
when you're having a couple drinks.

813
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:04,608
You clean it up. You practice in the car.

814
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:06,527
And when you walk in, you turn it on.

815
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,070
"If you'll check my references,

816
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:10,281
you'll see I'm more than qualified
for this position.

817
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,866
Please feel free to call Frank Torres.

818
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,910
Frank will tell you the amazing job
I did for him two and a half weeks ago.

819
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:18,247
Listen, I'm ready to work
seven days a week, 365 days a year.

820
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,958
No job is too big. No task is too small.

821
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,627
You can count on me.
I'm the right person for the job.

822
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,921
Please keep me in mind.
Thank you for your time."

823
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:28,549
-And then you get to the parking lot--

824
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,926
Then you get to the parking lot,
and you're like, "Whew!

825
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,638
<i>Hijo de la chingada. OjalÃ¡ me dÃ© trabajo
porque estÃ¡ cabrÃ³n, gÃ¼ey.</i>

826
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,057
I need a job, man. I need a job.

827
00:49:38,601 --> 00:49:39,602
Whew!"

828
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,398
You guys know
we all have our daytime voice

829
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,692
that we have
around our family and our friends

830
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,861
and our children, you know.

831
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:51,906
And then we have our late night voice,
you know, our party voice.

832
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,199
"JÃ¤ger!"

833
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:58,204
And then, if you're lucky enough, you have
your late, late, late night voice.

834
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:00,164
"That's right. You don't know
what's about to happen.

835
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:06,170
<i>You better get on-- Te voy a agarrar...
Te gusta así, ¿verdad?"</i>

836
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:09,298
Some of you are looking at me like,
"Oh, my God, Fluffy's a freak."

837
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:11,509
I'm just giving an example.

838
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,013
All the kids are like,
"Oh, this is different."

839
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,351
Sorry. I see those kids,
and they're just like--

840
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,021
<i>Dad's like, "Pinche Fluffy.
No, no, no, no, no.</i>

841
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:26,607
Stupid.
Bad Fluffy. Bad Fluffy. Bad Fluffy."

842
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,401
But, see, now over there,

843
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,528
they sound the same
no matter what they're doing.

844
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,322
When they apply for a job.

845
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,867
"If you'll check my references, you will
see I'm qualified for this position."

846
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,410
When they party.

847
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,372
"If you'll pour the wine, I will drink it.
It is brilliant, I tell you."

848
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,040
When they're making love.

849
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,501
"I'm going to part your legs
like the Red Sea.

850
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,671
I'm going to defile you
in such an amazing fashion,

851
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,173
you will rue the day
you came across me at that local pub.

852
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:54,051
I'm going to lower my drawbridge
and introduce you to the queen!

853
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:54,885
Yes, I shall.

854
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,681
When you arrive at that magical moment,
I want you to scream 'victory.'"

855
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,641
"Victory!" "My job is done here."

856
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,283
The only messed-up part about that joke

857
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:20,369
is that that's the only joke
the kids remember.

858
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,290
Two weeks from now,
you're trying to get in the room.

859
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:27,459
You're like, "Why is this door locked?"
And then you hear, "Victory!"

860
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,840
I see a couple of young adults there.
How old are you guys?

861
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,008
-Thirteen.
-Thirteen.

862
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,175
Wow. And next to you?

863
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,885
-How old are you?
-Ten.

864
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,012
You're ten.

865
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,472
Okay. I am so sorry for what Martin said.

866
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,313
Ten years old. I can't feel too bad
because you know what?

867
00:51:47,396 --> 00:51:49,815
Ten-year-olds are young adults.
You are a young adult.

868
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,233
I don't see you as a kid.

869
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:55,029
A kid to me, first of all, is someone
who doesn't have access to the Internet.

870
00:51:56,905 --> 00:52:00,618
You have, I'm sure, a tablet, a cell phone
or access to online services, right?

871
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,495
Services.
"What the hell is he talking about?"

872
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,540
Bad choice of words.
You know what I mean, right?

873
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,668
You've probably seen and heard
a few things already.

874
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:12,796
And the parents are like,
"No, not my child. I lock their phone."

875
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,757
Yeah, but you don't lock
their friend's phone.

876
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:21,096
I feel bad whenever I say something
that's kind of, like, risquÃ©

877
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,891
whenever parents bring a four-year-old,
five-year-old, six-year-old.

878
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,602
And, yes, it happens. Then I feel bad.

879
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:30,564
I'll meet 'em after the show and I'm like,
"I am so sorry for what you heard me say."

880
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,316
And it's always funny
to see the parents say,

881
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,109
"Oh, they hear worse at home."

882
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,490
Nothing like watching a four-year-old
confirm that. You know, just--

883
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,122
Like, for example, my son.

884
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:50,751
He's 18 years old,
but he still doesn't cuss at home. Okay?

885
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,961
Whatever he does in public,
I have no control over.

886
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,381
But at home he knows he cannot cuss.

887
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:56,882
One time.

888
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:02,304
One time in, like, 13 years
I caught my son cussing at home,

889
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,389
and I couldn't even get mad.

890
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,808
He had fallen down the stairs.

891
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,603
I don't mean to laugh,
but think about it.

892
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:13,399
What am I gonna do to him that's worse
than what he just did to himself?

893
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,026
I heard it too.

894
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,530
"Son of a bitch!"

895
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,575
I ran over.
I didn't even check his safety.

896
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,035
I was like, "What did you say?

897
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,957
Hey, you earned that one."

898
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,378
I said, "If you want to say the F-word,
next time let me push you."

899
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,091
That's when I knew he fell hard.
"Really?" "No. Get up here. Come on."

900
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,845
Cool. Welcome, you guys.
Hope you have a good--

901
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:45,514
I know you're getting nervous, Dad.
You're like, "What's he telling my son?"

902
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,724
No, nothing. Being cool.

903
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:51,061
But thank you for trusting me
to bring your kids to the show. Yeah.

904
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:53,522
-Or your young adults. Sorry.

905
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,275
Thank you for trusting me
to bring your young adults to the show.

906
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,571
By the way, I know I keep pointing
at people in the front right here.

907
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:03,115
If you're here tonight...

908
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,869
with someone
you have no business being here with...

909
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:11,623
and you see a camera coming by,
just be like, "Hey.

910
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:14,626
Victory!"

911
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,922
They're very respectful.
They'll go to the next person.

912
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:21,675
Don't even worry about that.

913
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,053
Before I forget, you guys,
I would like to thank the Allstate Arena

914
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,806
for providing some amazing
accommodations backstage.

915
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,643
Let me tell you right now,
I love my dressing room

916
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,980
for the simple fact that it has
basic things that I really like,

917
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,523
like light switches.

918
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,027
A lot of these arenas
are now starting to go green.

919
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,614
So they're taking away the light switches
and they're replacing 'em with sensors.

920
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:46,033
Sensors are cool when they work.

921
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,119
Know what I mean?
You're ten feet away, it senses you,

922
00:54:49,203 --> 00:54:51,246
and the whole room just--

923
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,791
What I don't like is
when they're messed up,

924
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:58,170
you have to walk into a dark-ass room
and establish your presence.

925
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,306
But then you stand still for four seconds.
"Shit!"

926
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:16,480
In addition,
backstage my sink has knobs on it.

927
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,899
I have control of the temperature
and pressure of the water,

928
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:21,485
which in the Chicago area,
I believe, is very important,

929
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:22,778
especially in the winter.

930
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,448
Oh, man,
you guys are no joke in the winter.

931
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:28,784
You need warm water
when you wash your hands.

932
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:31,453
You can't rely on a sensor
that gives you nothing but cold water,

933
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:34,540
'cause you wash your hands with
cold water, your hands get all cryptic.

934
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,708
You go outside,
people are making fun of you.

935
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:37,459
"Lookit. 'Thriller.'"

936
00:55:42,256 --> 00:55:47,386
My dressing room, you guys,
has a sink that has hot and cold--

937
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:50,514
You can control the water.
You can control the temperature.

938
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,890
You can control the pressure.

939
00:55:51,974 --> 00:55:55,310
I hate it when they take that away from us
and replace it with that little sensor.

940
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:58,522
So now, in addition to being a comedian,
now I gotta be a magician.

941
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,151
I'm not a magician, but if you watch me
wash my hands, that's what I look like.

942
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,864
Nothing. Then you walk away.

943
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,787
I feel like there's someone behind
the mirror messing with me. "Watch this."

944
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:19,126
Some places stop there.
Some places keep going.

945
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:23,380
I like a lot of soap when I wash my hands.
I like a good soap dispenser.

946
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,425
I like the, you know, the pump, the--

947
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,760
I hate it when they take that away from us

948
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:32,180
and then they replace it with that
little spout that goes next to the faucet.

949
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,099
You stick your hand under it,

950
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,435
and it gives you
that little booger of soap.

951
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,938
<i>You know what I mean? That little moco.
You put it under.</i>

952
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:41,940
You--

953
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,111
You need more.
So you pull it out and then go back in.

954
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,739
But the sensor's like,
"No. It's still you."

955
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,910
Now you gotta trick it, right?

956
00:56:56,288 --> 00:56:58,957
Once you get enough soap on your hands,
you gotta try to wash it off.

957
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,417
But you can't wash it off then

958
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,836
because the timer
for the water has timed out.

959
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:06,214
So now you have to back up and now
you have to put on a second performance.

960
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,426
Now it's a race
to get that soap off your hands.

961
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:12,888
Once you get the soap off your hands,
now you gotta try to dry your hands.

962
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:16,266
Some places still give you a towel.
Some places give you paper towels.

963
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:20,729
Some take the paper towels and put 'em
in a box on the wall with another sensor.

964
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,731
And there you are.

965
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:28,070
Three inches of paper.

966
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,698
Three inches, Chicago.
You can't do anything with three inches.

967
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:33,659
Ask any woman. They'll tell you.

968
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,248
Or a guy. I'm equal opportunity.

969
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,796
I need control of the paper.
I need the crank, the--

970
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,390
Some places stop there.
Some places keep going.

971
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,767
Have you ever walked
into the bathroom stall...

972
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,145
close the door, locked it,
turned around, looked at the toilet

973
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:04,189
and seen a blinking red light on the wall?

974
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,483
And you're like, "Really? Here too?"

975
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:11,571
All you're trying to do is get the tissue
paper off the wall for the toilet seat.

976
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,156
You take one step--

977
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:17,327
I haven't even done anything.

978
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,914
You grab the paper.

979
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:30,757
Hey!

980
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:46,231
You turn around
and you put it on like a cape.

981
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:52,487
And you let it slide down your back while
you slowly try to time it just right.

982
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:54,322
Just as you're about to sit down,

983
00:58:54,406 --> 00:58:56,825
somebody walks into the bathroom
and distracts you.

984
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:02,080
But it's too late. Your knees are bent.

985
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:05,125
And unless you do CrossFit,
you're not coming back from that one.

986
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,087
Then your bare ass touches the seat...

987
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,715
and you're like, "Aah!"

988
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:14,051
And just when you think
it can't get any worse--

989
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,931
And all this water's splashing up,
hitting you right in the ass.

990
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,893
And then the water goes down the drain
and it creates that air vortex

991
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,728
that goes right between your legs.

992
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,690
So now you have a tsunami in the back,
you have a tornado in the front.

993
00:59:28,774 --> 00:59:31,026
And who's the victim?
Pikachu.

994
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,324
And he's holding on for dear life.

995
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,494
You haven't even made magic yet,

996
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,704
and you've already been violated
by plumbing.

997
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,792
Now you do what you need to do.

998
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,211
You finish.

999
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:51,088
Now it's time for clean-up,

1000
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,631
time for maintenance.

1001
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,467
So you reach over for the toilet paper.

1002
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:58,136
And the problem
with using the restroom nowadays

1003
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,973
is that most venues, including this one,

1004
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:06,394
instead of putting
a human-size toilet paper roll

1005
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:10,482
inside of the human-size
toilet paper roll dispenser...

1006
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,193
they take their ass
to Costco or Sam's Club

1007
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,278
or one of these places
where you buy in bulk,

1008
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:18,532
and they buy
that giant gorilla roll of toilet paper.

1009
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:22,828
Then they come back here and they force it
into that little tiny compartment...

1010
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,622
and then they close the door on it.

1011
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,041
So now this giant wheel
is locked in place.

1012
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,709
You can't even spin it. You're just--

1013
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:38,093
You can't even find where it starts
because they glue it.

1014
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,013
Out of desperation
you gotta pull out your car keys

1015
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,598
and cut into the side of it

1016
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:45,767
<i>like a bag of cocaine on Narcos.</i>

1017
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,397
Then you get the paper.

1018
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,941
You try to wipe.

1019
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,238
Chicago, a year from now,

1020
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,407
a year from now I am predicting

1021
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:05,120
that they are going to take 100% control
of the restroom.

1022
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:08,165
You're gonna be sitting there,
and you're gonna think of me

1023
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,457
'cause you're gonna see it.

1024
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,085
You're gonna look over
to get the toilet paper,

1025
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:15,046
and there's gonna be
a blinking red light on it.

1026
01:01:15,714 --> 01:01:18,216
And you're gonna be like,
"Oh, my God, Fluffy called it."

1027
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:21,553
And what are you gonna have to do?

1028
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:24,806
One sheet.

1029
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,938
You're gonna get frustrated
and just sit on it, just--

1030
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:42,407
<i>Sorry, bro. I know that was
a lot of culo I threw at you right there.</i>

1031
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:46,453
<i>She's like,
"It's like Magic Mike."</i>

1032
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:51,499
I am so sorry, bro.
That was a lot.

1033
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,336
"Damn!" Yeah.

1034
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:58,256
You guys, I understand.

1035
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,593
I understand
why they do this to our restrooms,

1036
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:03,970
why they put sensors in places,

1037
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:07,224
because they're trying to save energy,
they're trying to save water.

1038
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,725
I live in California.

1039
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:11,811
We need water. Okay? We do.

1040
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:14,105
But some places need sensors,
some places don't.

1041
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,526
Some places are good at teaching us
how to conserve energy and conserve water.

1042
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:22,197
Some places are horrible at it,
like the hotel that we're staying at.

1043
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,950
They have a very basic thing that they do.

1044
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,452
They have a little cardboard sign

1045
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,580
that hangs on the towel rack
in the bathroom.

1046
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:36,127
All it says is, "Please help save water
by reusing your towel."

1047
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:39,256
On the back, a diagram shows you
the millions of gallons of water

1048
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,758
that are saved every year
when people reuse their towel.

1049
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:45,220
I reuse 'em at home.
I got no problem doing that at the hotel.

1050
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,513
It's my towel.

1051
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:48,682
Some people
don't want to reuse their towels.

1052
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,725
They're like, "That towel's dirty."

1053
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,937
Well, if that towel's dirty,
then you suck at showers.

1054
01:02:55,981 --> 01:02:58,817
Because theoretically
that white towel should be white

1055
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,860
every single time you use it.

1056
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:04,489
But, no, people like to roll it up
and then go expert mode with it.

1057
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:08,285
And now you waste more water
trying to get that out.

1058
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,329
Like I said, some places
are good at teaching us

1059
01:03:11,413 --> 01:03:13,623
how to save energy, save water.

1060
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,500
Some places are horrible at it.

1061
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:19,587
I was at a university not too long ago
very close to here.

1062
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:22,924
And this university has a lot of money,

1063
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:28,054
so much so that they have their own
private police department on campus.

1064
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,307
It's only for the campus.
Now, that's not a big deal.

1065
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:33,310
There's a lot of colleges
that have their own on-campus police.

1066
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:37,605
The difference is
this college, somehow or another,

1067
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:43,695
wound up giving the police department
Priuses to use for their patrol cars.

1068
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,197
-Some of you already know the university.

1069
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,116
Now, look, this is not even a joke.

1070
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,786
My thing is that,
if you're an officer of the law...

1071
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:54,581
it's your job to fight crime.

1072
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:58,335
The first thing that people see
when you arrive on a scene

1073
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,920
is your mode of transportation.

1074
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:05,425
Your vehicle needs to establish
dominance of the situation

1075
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,510
before you set one foot outside.

1076
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,429
In California,

1077
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:14,392
over 65% of California Highway Patrol
officers now drive SUVs.

1078
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:16,936
So when you get stopped over there,
you feel it.

1079
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,646
You're intimidated by it.

1080
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,821
And people jump out on the freeway.
"Don't kill me!"

1081
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,283
Now, imagine getting stopped by--

1082
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:38,333
Don't let me get stopped
by a cop in a Prius...

1083
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,668
with attitude.

1084
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,838
"You know why I stopped you?"

1085
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,757
'Cause I let you?

1086
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,182
Imagine the first time
they did a DUI stop.

1087
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:57,602
The cop probably didn't even get out
of the car. He just stayed on the radio.

1088
01:04:57,685 --> 01:05:01,523
"Sir, step out of your vehicle right now."
"Okay. Okay."

1089
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,024
"All right.

1090
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,028
Is that a Prius?

1091
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,532
I must be drunk."

1092
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:14,911
"Sir, walk the line."
"Okay, all right, all right, all right.

1093
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,538
Officer?

1094
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:20,834
If I gotta go to jail, can you call
a real cop car to pick me up?"

1095
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:23,920
"Stop being a smart-ass. Walk the line."

1096
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:26,506
"Okay. Hey, real quick, real quick,
real quick, real quick.

1097
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,550
Hey, hey, hey, charge my phone."

1098
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,055
"That's it. You're going to jail."

1099
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,066
I don't know, man.

1100
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:48,403
<i>-A lot of time--
Yes, sir? Que pasó?</i>

1101
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:53,241
I love you too, bro.
Give me cake, sugar-free.

1102
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:59,581
Thank you. I gotta be careful.
I almost slipped right there.

1103
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,168
He's like, "I'll catch you."
Yeah, you'll catch me, you'll catch me

1104
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,252
and you'll catch me.

1105
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:06,045
It's like SeaWorld without the water.

1106
01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,677
I gotta start being careful, you guys,
because I'm noticing now,

1107
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,888
after six specials,

1108
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,600
that a lot of my material,
a lot of my stories

1109
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:21,561
are starting to come back to haunt me.

1110
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:26,024
Some of them in good ways,
some of them not so good.

1111
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:28,193
For example, in 1997...

1112
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:32,071
on TV one time, one time, I said,

1113
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:35,074
"I love chocolate cake."

1114
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:36,993
One time.

1115
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,412
Nineteen years later,

1116
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:42,540
people are still bringing me
chocolate cakes.

1117
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:46,127
That is crazy. I mean, think about that.

1118
01:06:46,211 --> 01:06:48,254
Nineteen years ago,
and I'm still getting cake.

1119
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,756
I've only said it one time.

1120
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,176
Next thing you know, I talked
about how much I love diet sodas.

1121
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,803
Next thing you know,
people started bringing me diet sodas.

1122
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:57,972
<i>In the following special, Aloha Fluffy,</i>

1123
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,517
I started talking about
how my son's growing a little bit older

1124
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,853
and the hormones are kicking in
and he needed to use deodorant.

1125
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,897
Next thing you know,
his friends started bringing deodorant

1126
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:09,067
and people started bringing deodorant
to my shows for me to give to my son.

1127
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,779
<i>In that same special, Aloha Fluffy...</i>

1128
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:16,157
I told a story, a story that went viral,

1129
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:19,536
called "The Racist Gift Basket Story."

1130
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:25,250
The story itself
is about 15 minutes long, okay?

1131
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:30,255
I'm gonna give you
the three-minute version of that story

1132
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:32,590
so you understand what's going on.

1133
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:36,386
Basically, Martin and I are doing a show
in Sacramento, California.

1134
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,763
We're driving from LA to Sacramento.

1135
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:41,683
We're passing through a small town
called Fresno.

1136
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,768
As we're passing through Fresno,

1137
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:46,312
we reach out to the local promoter
who does the shows there.

1138
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,564
We're good friends with him.

1139
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,983
And he tells us, you know,
'cause we're trying to have lunch--

1140
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,152
And he goes, "He's busy.
But by the way, G Reilly's in town."

1141
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,196
And we're like, "Oh, shoot,
our friend G Reilly's in town."

1142
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,657
"He's at the hotel."
"All right, he's at the hotel."

1143
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,284
We knew exactly where he was at.

1144
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:02,120
So I say,
"Martin, how about we go and visit G?"

1145
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:03,413
Martin goes, "Let's stop by."

1146
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:06,374
I figured first let's pick up some sodas,
some drinks so we can surprise him.

1147
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,005
We get to the market. We walk in the door,
we see a whole pile of gift baskets.

1148
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:14,882
Martin goes,
"We should get him a gift basket."

1149
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:18,094
I said, "Martin,
G Reilly doesn't like gift baskets, okay?

1150
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:21,514
He doesn't like the fancy wine
and the fancy cheese and the sausage.

1151
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:23,808
He definitely hates crackers."

1152
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:27,687
-You don't even know why that's so funny.

1153
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,564
-But anyways--

1154
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,149
I said, "How about this, Martin?

1155
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,192
He doesn't know we're coming.
Let's have fun with him.

1156
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:36,779
How about we make him
a racist gift basket?"

1157
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:38,072
And Martin goes, "What's that?"

1158
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:39,991
I go, "You know, Martin,
a racist gift basket,

1159
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:42,327
a gift basket designed to have fun

1160
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:44,454
with whatever race
you're trying to mess with."

1161
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:46,372
Now, in G's case, he's black.

1162
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:47,540
It was easy.

1163
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,960
Now, I say easy not to be an ass.

1164
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,588
I say easy
because there are so many stereotypes

1165
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,590
attached to African Americans.

1166
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:57,967
So we had this empty gift basket.

1167
01:08:58,051 --> 01:08:59,427
What did we put in it?

1168
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,972
Fried chicken, watermelon,
Kool-Aid, grape soda,

1169
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,350
barbecued potato chips, sunflower seeds,

1170
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,726
<i>an Ebony magazine,</i>

1171
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,896
<i>a Chris Rock DVD
called Bigger and Blacker,</i>

1172
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,106
Magnum condoms, Newport cigarettes,

1173
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,400
a rack of ribs, the recipe for corn bread.

1174
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,528
We put everything but a white girl
with a big ass in the basket.

1175
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:23,326
We wrapped it up really nice,
we put a big bow on it

1176
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,744
and took it to the hotel.

1177
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,330
We had the girl at the front desk
deliver it to his room.

1178
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,541
Martin and I are waiting in the hallway
where he can't see us.

1179
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,543
So she knocks on the door.

1180
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:35,171
G Reilly opens the door.
She gives him the gift basket.

1181
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:38,091
He says, "Thank you," closes the door.

1182
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,550
Martin and I run to the door,

1183
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:42,720
and we start listening to him
opening up the gift basket.

1184
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:46,265
As he's opening it, he's getting excited.

1185
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:52,814
And he is enjoying every single thing
he is pulling out of that basket.

1186
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:56,818
He is loving this basket
until he realizes it's a practical joke,

1187
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:59,362
and then he freaks out
because he read the greeting card.

1188
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,490
The greeting card freaked him out

1189
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:06,369
because now he thinks
that the KKK sent the gift basket.

1190
01:10:07,745 --> 01:10:09,622
Some of you are like,
"Why does he think that?"

1191
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:10,832
'Cause that's what we wrote.

1192
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:16,045
If you're gonna do a practical joke,
you go big or you go home.

1193
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,173
So he freaks out
and he tries to run out of the hotel room.

1194
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:22,427
As soon as he gets in the hallway,
he sees Martin and I laughing

1195
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,053
and he puts two and two together.

1196
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,596
So then he cusses us out.

1197
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,350
He forgives us, gives us a hug,
high five, we go back in his room.

1198
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:31,561
And then I eat his chicken.

1199
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:38,443
What winds up happening is
that story goes crazy on Comedy Central.

1200
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:40,445
People are giving 'em a hard time.
They pull it.

1201
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:43,573
Next thing you know,
I upload it through YouTube.

1202
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,533
Ten million views it gets on YouTube.

1203
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,911
Then they flag it
because the word "racist" is in the title.

1204
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,038
So it gets pulled off.
So then I reupload it.

1205
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:53,708
It gets another ten million.
Then I had people share it.

1206
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,002
All in all, the video's probably gotten

1207
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,671
about a little over
a hundred million views.

1208
01:10:58,755 --> 01:10:59,881
So here's what happened.

1209
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:02,759
Just like...

1210
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:04,761
the chocolate cakes--

1211
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:12,643
the diet soda...

1212
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,062
and the deodorant...

1213
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,900
before you know it,
people started bringing me...

1214
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:21,986
Mexican racist gift baskets.

1215
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:30,703
Now, when it first started happening--
Listen, guys, I'm not gonna lie.

1216
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:33,706
It was actually kind of cute
because it was only other Mexicans

1217
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,834
bringing me
these "Mexican racist gift baskets."

1218
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:38,795
It started in LA after a show.

1219
01:11:38,878 --> 01:11:41,297
This one guy walks up to me with a basket,
and he's like,

1220
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:44,175
"Hey, what's up, homey?
Got you a racist gift basket."

1221
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:47,053
I said, "We're the same race."
"Hey, whatever." "All right, whatever."

1222
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,389
I take it backstage,

1223
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:55,269
and all the items in the basket
made it to my house.

1224
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,522
There was a Mexican blanket
with a tiger on it,

1225
01:11:57,605 --> 01:12:00,358
a bunch of bottles of Fanta,
bottles of sangria,

1226
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:02,652
Vicente FernÃ¡ndez CDs, Mexican candy,

1227
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:04,904
<i>pan dulce, sweet bread, mazapanes.</i>

1228
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,323
Everything made it to my house.

1229
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,200
Now...

1230
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,954
the more East Coast we started traveling

1231
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,540
and the more Down South
we started performing...

1232
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,124
the more...

1233
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,920
creative...

1234
01:12:22,255 --> 01:12:24,674
the gift baskets started getting.

1235
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,927
Fast-forward to Mobile, Alabama.

1236
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,264
Oh, it gets good.

1237
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:36,143
Earlier tonight,
before we kicked off this special,

1238
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:39,272
my friend Martin was out here
making a couple of announcements.

1239
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,524
One of the announcements that he made was,

1240
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:45,528
"If you brought a gift,
please hold on to it until after the show.

1241
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:46,779
Don't bring it to the stage.

1242
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:48,489
It could interrupt the flow
of the performance."

1243
01:12:49,073 --> 01:12:52,368
The only reason
why he makes this announcement

1244
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:54,579
every single night

1245
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,123
is because of one show in Mobile.

1246
01:12:57,665 --> 01:12:58,666
So here's what happens.

1247
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:01,502
I tell
the entire "Racist Gift Basket Story,"

1248
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:02,962
the full 16 minutes, right?

1249
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:06,591
As soon as I finish,
a guy from the back of the theater

1250
01:13:06,674 --> 01:13:08,384
rushes the front of the stage.

1251
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,803
Now keep in mind this area is full.

1252
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,598
In Mobile
the aisle was right up the middle.

1253
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:15,600
So the guy had a clean shot to me.

1254
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,394
<i>He hauled ass like it was
The Price Is Right all the way down.</i>

1255
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:23,941
Much like tonight,
there was security there that night.

1256
01:13:24,025 --> 01:13:28,362
Security sees the guy with the basket,
but no one thought to stop him.

1257
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,991
All they did was,
"That's pretty."

1258
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,076
"Oh, that's nice. That's pretty, yeah."

1259
01:13:34,160 --> 01:13:37,038
So the guy makes it all the way
to the front, takes the gift basket,

1260
01:13:37,121 --> 01:13:38,664
and he puts it on the stage.

1261
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,708
Now he's heckling me
from where you're sitting.

1262
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,878
I'm standing here and he's like, "Fluffy!"

1263
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,298
"What's up, dude?"
"I got this for you."

1264
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:48,799
Thank you.

1265
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:49,967
"Open it."

1266
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:53,346
I go, "Sir, we're in the middle of a show
right now."

1267
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,932
I says, "I appreciate the gift.
That's very nice of you.

1268
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:58,059
But how about this?
I'll open it after the show."

1269
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,686
"Oh, come on, Fluffy.
I wanna see your face."

1270
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,021
"Sir, how about this?

1271
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:05,900
How about you take the gift basket and
bring it to the side where security's at?

1272
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:08,361
And I'll have security escort you
behind the curtain.

1273
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:11,572
And then I'll open it up backstage
with you in front of me. How's that?"

1274
01:14:11,656 --> 01:14:13,324
And he's not taking no for an answer.

1275
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:18,788
Now the problem is the crowd just saw me
tell "The Racist Gift Basket Story,"

1276
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:21,457
and all of a sudden
there's a guy with a gift basket.

1277
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,085
They have no idea I'm not affiliated

1278
01:14:24,168 --> 01:14:26,462
with freakin' Duck Dynasty
in the front row.

1279
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:31,717
So now I'm trying to defuse the situation
before it gets crazy,

1280
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,928
but he's not taking no for an answer.

1281
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:37,932
Next thing you know, he does something
no other audience member has ever done

1282
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:40,685
in my 19-plus years as a comedian.

1283
01:14:41,185 --> 01:14:46,023
He takes the whole crowd away from me,
flips 'em, and then uses 'em on me...

1284
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,442
in five seconds.

1285
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:52,405
It was the most amazing, horrific thing
I have ever witnessed.

1286
01:14:52,989 --> 01:14:54,115
This is all he did:

1287
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,783
"Come on, Fluffy!

1288
01:14:55,866 --> 01:14:57,535
We wanna see your face!

1289
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:00,496
We wanna see your face!
We wanna see your--"

1290
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:04,041
He gets 2,000 people behind him
to start chanting.

1291
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,127
"We wanna see your face.

1292
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,920
We wanna see your face."

1293
01:15:08,004 --> 01:15:12,049
It was very evident this was not
the first rally he's ever led.

1294
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,138
The crowd is so loud,

1295
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,473
I can no longer hear myself
over the monitor.

1296
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,976
So I'm like-- I lost.
So I get on my hands and knees.

1297
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:24,353
I put the microphone down,
I grab the gift basket,

1298
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:26,105
and I start tearing it open.

1299
01:15:26,188 --> 01:15:27,398
I reach in.

1300
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:32,028
Forget about pulling out Mexican soda,
Mexican candy or a Mexican blanket.

1301
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:33,988
This dude was a pro.

1302
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:38,075
I started pulling out gardening tools.

1303
01:15:44,915 --> 01:15:48,502
I'm pulling out a rake,
a toy shovel, a toy leaf blower.

1304
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:50,671
"Dig deeper, Fluffy! Dig deeper!"

1305
01:15:50,755 --> 01:15:53,591
I pull out a soccer ball.
I go, "Dude, it says Puerto Rico."

1306
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,384
"They ran out of Mexico."

1307
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:59,764
I pull out a brick.
I go, "What's the brick for?"

1308
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:00,973
"The wall."

1309
01:16:03,601 --> 01:16:08,272
I pull out an actual application
for US citizenship.

1310
01:16:11,067 --> 01:16:13,110
I said,
"There's no way this can get any worse."

1311
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,278
"Dig deeper!"

1312
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:15,529
I was wrong.

1313
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:19,867
I pull out
an old-school box of Crayola Crayons.

1314
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:22,828
You know, the 64-pack
that has a sharpener in the back?

1315
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,288
-Okay.

1316
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:26,123
There's a window
on the front of the crayons

1317
01:16:26,207 --> 01:16:29,710
so you can see
all of the colors that are in the box.

1318
01:16:29,794 --> 01:16:32,046
All of the crayons in the box are brown

1319
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:36,008
except for one white crayon
right in the middle.

1320
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:39,637
And I said,
"What the hell is that supposed to mean?"

1321
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:43,140
And he looks at me and he says,
"Welcome to my world."

1322
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:52,900
The crowd is laughing so hard,

1323
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:56,362
I know for a fact I don't have a joke
that's gonna follow that.

1324
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,156
So I made like
that was the end of my performance.

1325
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,159
I picked up the gift basket.
I said, "Thank you, Mobile!"

1326
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:05,913
And I gave the guy a dirty look.
"Motherfucker!"

1327
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,294
I go behind the curtain.
Martin is waiting behind the curtain.

1328
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,296
And Martin's like, "Bro.

1329
01:17:15,673 --> 01:17:17,341
You killed it out there."

1330
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:20,553
I go, "Martin,
they weren't laughing at my jokes."

1331
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:23,180
"What were they laughing at?"
And I showed him the application.

1332
01:17:23,264 --> 01:17:25,057
And he's like--

1333
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:27,935
"You're not my friend. Not my friend."

1334
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:31,772
So I walk into the dressing room,
you guys, and I'm pissed, man.

1335
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:34,483
I walk in. I close the door.

1336
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,402
Put the basket down.
I'm scratching my head.

1337
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:38,821
I'm trying to think,
"What could I have done

1338
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:41,282
to have prevented that
from getting to where it went?

1339
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:44,118
Should I have grabbed
the gift basket, moved it out of the way?

1340
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:47,329
Should I have had security grab the guy?
Grab the gift basket and the guy?"

1341
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:51,125
Every idea that I'm coming up with
is ending worse.

1342
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,043
Finally, I accept it.

1343
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:54,670
I jump in the shower.

1344
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,381
I get out. I get dressed.
Security shows up.

1345
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:58,924
"Mr. Iglesias?"

1346
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,009
"Yeah." "Ready?"

1347
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,512
"Yeah, yeah. Give me a second."
I grab my backpack. I put on my backpack.

1348
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:07,141
I walk over to the door,
open up the door. "Let's go."

1349
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:10,060
He sees the gift basket on the chair,

1350
01:18:10,144 --> 01:18:12,062
and he's trying to be nice.

1351
01:18:12,146 --> 01:18:13,564
"I'll get that for you, sir."

1352
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:15,149
"Uh--

1353
01:18:15,733 --> 01:18:17,026
Yeah, bring it.

1354
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,447
Bring... Never know
when you might need an application."

1355
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:29,371
So now he's escorting me out the back door
of the theater into an empty parking lot

1356
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,916
on our way to the tour bus
that's at the very end of the parking lot.

1357
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:34,793
We're walking for a good four minutes.

1358
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:36,962
All of a sudden, I hear this:

1359
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,590
"Fluffy!

1360
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:41,550
Whoo-ooh! Fluffy!

1361
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:46,138
Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Flu-Fluffy!
Hoo-hoo, Fluffy!"

1362
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:48,432
I'm like, "Is he hog-calling me?"

1363
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:50,684
"I believe so, sir."

1364
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:54,021
It's the guy that gave me the gift basket,

1365
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,398
and now he's standing
next to the tour bus.

1366
01:18:56,482 --> 01:18:58,275
So there's no way I'm gonna get past him.

1367
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:01,278
So I'm like, "Man!" So we stop walking.

1368
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,322
Security's like,
"Would you like me to call for backup?"

1369
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,449
"You don't need to.
He's not gonna hurt me.

1370
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,825
It's just gonna get really weird."

1371
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,746
I pull out my cell phone,
and I'm trying to text Martin.

1372
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:12,915
"Come on, Martin. Get over--"
He's not replying.

1373
01:19:12,998 --> 01:19:15,834
The guy gets tired of waiting
next to the bus.

1374
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,753
So now he's walking towards me,

1375
01:19:17,836 --> 01:19:20,339
but he's doing it in a really weird way.

1376
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:23,801
He's walking towards me
like I'm a dangerous animal.

1377
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,679
Okay? He's doing this: "Fluffy.

1378
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:31,725
Fluffy."

1379
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,394
"I'm not gonna do anything!"

1380
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:35,604
And he walks over, and he's just ranting.

1381
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:37,106
"All right, look here, Fluffster.

1382
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,650
First and foremost,
let me just tell you something right now.

1383
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:42,152
I've been watching your comedy
for about seven years now,

1384
01:19:42,236 --> 01:19:43,904
and my favorite joke that you tell

1385
01:19:43,988 --> 01:19:47,032
is when you give that gift basket
to your colored friend G.

1386
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,410
Man, first time
I heard you tell that joke,

1387
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,495
I wanted to laugh really hard,
but I couldn't, right?

1388
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,831
'Cause I was at a bar
sitting next to two black people.

1389
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,208
You can't laugh at a black joke
in front of black people

1390
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,252
'cause they get all uppity,
start chanting civil rights

1391
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,795
and Rosa Parks and shit like that.

1392
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,423
And, hey, I voted for Obama,
but it's too soon to laugh.

1393
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:03,465
You know what I'm sayin'?

1394
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:06,385
Anyway, I took my happy ass home,
and I got on the Internet,

1395
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,887
and I Googled 'Racist Gift Basket,'
and your joke came up,

1396
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:13,225
and I had me a good old laugh, and I says,
'You know, I love Fluffy's sense of humor.

1397
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:15,269
He likes to push the envelope
with his friends,

1398
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:18,939
and he doesn't allow political correctness
to interfere with a good friendship.

1399
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,983
At the end of the day,
you're still friends,

1400
01:20:21,066 --> 01:20:23,652
you still love each other,
you still respect one another.'

1401
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:27,239
I said, 'Hey, if the Fluffster
ever shows his ass here in Mobile,

1402
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,408
be first in line to get me one
of them tickets.'

1403
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:31,785
And you came! So I tell my friends,

1404
01:20:31,869 --> 01:20:33,954
'Let's go! Let's go see the Fluffster.'

1405
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:37,124
I said, 'But first, I'd bet you anything
he'd appreciate it

1406
01:20:37,207 --> 01:20:40,627
if somebody were to get him
one of them gift baskets like he got G.'

1407
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:43,088
Except we got you the UPS basket."

1408
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,506
"UPS basket?"

1409
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:47,426
"Yeah, 'What can brown do for you?' So--"

1410
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,348
"The problem is you didn't laugh.

1411
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:55,476
You got offended, and I didn't want you
to get offended, Fluffster.

1412
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:56,685
I wanted you to laugh.

1413
01:20:56,769 --> 01:21:00,022
But the problem is, is that, you know,
I didn't need you thinking

1414
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:02,775
that Mobile was a horrible place
and we were horrible people.

1415
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:06,487
We were just trying to have fun with you
the same way you had fun with G.

1416
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:09,365
We work very hard here,
40-plus hours a week myself.

1417
01:21:09,448 --> 01:21:12,993
And the amount of money and time
that we put into that gift basket

1418
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:14,661
is only because we love you.

1419
01:21:14,745 --> 01:21:18,415
Hey, you have any idea
how long I was on the goddamn Internet

1420
01:21:18,499 --> 01:21:21,085
trying to find
an application for US citizenship?

1421
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,797
In English? Are you shitting me?

1422
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,341
<i>Everything's in espaÃ±ol.</i>

1423
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:29,760
Hey, I voted for Obama.
I ain't got time for that.

1424
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:33,806
The bottom line is that I'm sorry
for interfering with your performance.

1425
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:36,016
It'll never happen again.

1426
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,018
I just wanted to say I'm sorry,

1427
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:41,271
and hopefully you'll allow me
to take a picture with you.

1428
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:42,189
I'm sorry."

1429
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,691
And I was like, "Oh, my God, I'm a dick."

1430
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:49,071
I said,
"Listen, sir, you don't have to apologize.

1431
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:52,366
I should apologize. I didn't handle
the situation the right way.

1432
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,159
But you gotta look at it through my eyes.

1433
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:57,704
I've never had anyone
take an entire crowd away from me."

1434
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:59,832
"That was pretty good, huh?"
"Will you listen?

1435
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,293
Yes, that was pretty good.

1436
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:06,630
Look, I'm very sorry that I got upset.
First time that happens.

1437
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:09,216
I won't let that happen again.
You don't have to apologize.

1438
01:22:09,299 --> 01:22:11,468
I will be happy
to take a picture with you."

1439
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:13,846
"Now, see-- Now, see?

1440
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:17,724
That's what I'm saying right there.
That's what I'm saying right there!

1441
01:22:17,808 --> 01:22:20,018
All my friends are like,
'To hell with that beaner.'

1442
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:22,020
I said, 'Nope. Nope.

1443
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,856
That beaner is good people.'"

1444
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,741
And then he pulled out his camera, right?

1445
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:42,749
And he tries to hand
this disposable FunSaver camera

1446
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:44,543
to this 19-year-old security guard

1447
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:47,421
who's never handled
that level of technology.

1448
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,966
He puts the gift basket down.
We hand him the camera.

1449
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:53,343
He's looking for an app.
He's looking for a screen.

1450
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:57,306
Meanwhile, the guy wants to pose
with his arm over my shoulders.

1451
01:22:57,389 --> 01:23:00,267
He's a little shorter than me,
so I gotta do this one right here, okay?

1452
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,061
He's got me in this headlock,
and he just starts talking.

1453
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,856
"Look here, Fluffster.
Let me just tell you something right now.

1454
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,357
I really appreciate what you do.

1455
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:10,986
I'm gonna continue to pray for you,
your family, your friends and your success

1456
01:23:11,069 --> 01:23:12,613
because what you do is a godsend.

1457
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:13,655
It really is.

1458
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,533
In these times, you make people smile,
you make people laugh.

1459
01:23:16,617 --> 01:23:18,702
We need more of that in our lives.

1460
01:23:18,785 --> 01:23:21,371
Look, I'm not trying to blow smoke
up your butt, but look.

1461
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:24,791
I don't have children,
but if I ever had one of my own,

1462
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:27,711
I'd hope he'd have your spirit.
God bless you."

1463
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,130
"Listen. Thank you.

1464
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:32,758
Thank you very much.

1465
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:40,098
Hey, buddy, listen.
If there's anything I can do--"

1466
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,642
"Hey, b-b-b-b-bah.

1467
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:43,685
D-Don't do that. Don't do that.

1468
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:44,853
Don't do that.

1469
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,564
Don't say what you don't mean.

1470
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,149
Let's just take a picture.

1471
01:23:49,233 --> 01:23:51,944
Don't say what you don't mean
if you don't mean it."

1472
01:23:57,241 --> 01:24:00,619
"If there's anything I can do,
please let me know."

1473
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,585
"Hold up the application."

1474
01:24:12,256 --> 01:24:15,008
Chicago, I love you. Thank you.

1475
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,011
Have a great night. Thank you so much.

1476
01:24:18,095 --> 01:24:20,847
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you!
