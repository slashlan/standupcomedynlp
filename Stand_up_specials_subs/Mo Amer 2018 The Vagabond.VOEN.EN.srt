1
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,889
Mo! Mo! Mo! Mo! Mo!

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,975
Mo! Mo! Mo! Mo! Mo! Mo! Mo!

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,691
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Texas' own...

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,569
Mo Amer!

5
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,183
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

6
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,269
What's up, Austin? Have a seat.

7
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,980
Austin, Texas.

8
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,231
Man!

9
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,943
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

10
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,527
Wow!

11
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:12,739
Well, can I...

12
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,450
All right, well... All right, guys.

13
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,161
Jesus, good to see everybody, man.

14
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:22,791
Austin, man, it's beautiful.
Home state of Texas...

15
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,375
It's a good time.

16
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,670
Yes, I am Mo, guys.

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,714
You know,
Mo is actually short for Mohammed.

18
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,758
Surprise, bitches! Today is the day!

19
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,262
Your cell phones are locked up.
It's too late for you, motherfuckers!

20
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,349
Get the door, Aziz! No, I'm just kidding.

21
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,058
Okay.

22
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,354
I get all kinds of different reactions.

23
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,272
I was in Little Rock, Arkansas.

24
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:47,607
Everything is goin' great.

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,192
I say I'm an Arab-American.

26
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:53,029
The whole room gets quiet,
and one guy in the back goes...

27
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,115
"Hell, no!"

28
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,993
There was one black couple
that actually got up and left.

29
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,706
Like, "We seen this shit before.
Come on, baby," and they just took off.

30
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,376
It was frustrating.

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,212
Mohammed
is the most popular name in the world,

32
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,215
but I can't find one key chain
with my name on it anywhere.

33
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,428
Not one person has shared a Coca-Cola
with me in America,

34
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,265
not a single fucking person.

35
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:25,854
I'll be honest, though. I didn't even
know how popular the name was

36
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,314
until I watched the Egyptian soccer team.

37
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,859
They were showing a play-by-play

38
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,612
and the commentator comes on
and he's like, "Mohammed has the ball.

39
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,531
Mohammed pass the ball to Mohammed.

40
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,242
Mohammed to Ahmed. Ahmed to Hamed.

41
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,245
Aaah! Hamed to Mohammed.
Mohammed to Mohammed.

42
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,496
Mohammed to Mohammed.

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,582
Mohammed! Mohammed! Mohammed!

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,667
Gooooalll!"

45
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,131
"This weed is too strong, Jeffrey.

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,719
I think there's just one guy on the team
passin' the ball to himself, bro.

47
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:58,970
I'm freaking out, man!"

48
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,389
Man!

49
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,351
It's a weird time to be Mohammed,
you know?

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,605
It's a weird time.

51
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,191
It's also weirder with Trump in office

52
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,985
and the thing that happened
with me and Eric Trump, my God,

53
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,445
we went viral all over the place

54
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,947
and all that happened
was I got upgraded to first class.

55
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,992
I end up sitting next to Eric Trump
and then shit went super-viral!

56
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,912
I didn't know I was gonna
get upgraded to first class,

57
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:27,582
much less sittin' next to Eric Trump,
but I do know one thing.

58
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,377
The lady that upgraded me
is probably a Clinton supporter.

59
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,461
Let's be real.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,758
I'm just sayin'.
She was probably sittin' there like,

61
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,636
"Eric Trump is on my flight?

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,347
Okay. Okay.-"

63
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,642
I don't know why she has a mustache.
"Okay.

64
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,106
"There's an empty seat next to Eric?
Okay.

65
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:57,028
Let me take a look at this upgrade list,
see who's standing by patiently here.

66
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,364
Mohammed Mustafa Amer!

67
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,367
Upgrade this motherfucker immediately!"

68
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,160
That's probably what happened.

69
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,917
I'm not 100% sure, but I'm, like, 99% sure

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,462
'cause I've never been greeted
with such enthusiasm

71
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,548
prior to boarding an aircraft.

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,970
With the name Mohammed, flying out
of New York, it's just never happened.

73
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,599
I show up, I scan my boarding pass.

74
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,936
She's like, "Guess who's been upgraded?

75
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,355
Boom, byeow, byeow, byeow, byeow!"

76
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,233
I was like, "Shit,
you have an air horn? I didn't know."

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,945
I was so dumb, though.

78
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,032
I was like, "Yeah, it's all these years
and dedication to this airline.

79
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,201
I'm finally gettin' the respect
that I deserve."

80
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,870
I'm just walking in there like,
"Yeah, Million Mile Club, bitch!"

81
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,954
You know, like...

82
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,165
It wasn't the case.

83
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,043
I turned the corner,
I was like, "Holy shit!

84
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,753
Is that Eric Trump?"

85
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,423
I was like, "Nah." I didn't believe it,
so I put up my bag,

86
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,467
took a second look
and I saw his name on his sweater.

87
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,718
So...

88
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,222
no further investigation necessary.

89
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,851
I mean, that's what
you do with the slow kid in your family

90
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,436
when you go to a theme park...

91
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:15,023
so when they get lost,
they know how to identify themselves.

92
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,106
I just...

93
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,736
I just sat down next to him
and I was like, "Salaam alaikum, Eric!

94
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,819
How's it goin', man?"

95
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,031
He was like, "Everything's cool?"

96
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,949
I was like,
"I'm just messin' with you, man.

97
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:28,244
Listen, my name's Mohammed.
I'm a Muslim, I'm Arab

98
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,747
and a comedian,
so I had to mess with you a little bit

99
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,041
and I also came here as a refugee.

100
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,709
Too late, bitch! I made it!"

101
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,085
You know, it was nice.

102
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,511
Then I shifted gears on him.
He didn't see it comin'.

103
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,598
I was like, "Hey, you tell your dad
to build all the damn walls he wants."

104
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,724
He was like, "What?"

105
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,935
I was like, "That's right. Tell your dad
to build all the walls he wants.

106
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,230
My family flew in, you know what I mean?
There is no problem.

107
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,194
One $9 Spirit Airlines flight
and I'll be back in business."

108
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,283
It's just weird.
I was actually born in Kuwait, right?

109
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,703
I left Kuwait after the first Gulf War.
I was nine years old.

110
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,873
I went to a nice private
British English school in Kuwait.

111
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,376
I wore a little vest and a bow tie
to school.

112
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,420
I was an adorable Arab kid
with a hint of a British accent.

113
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,132
I was like, "'Ello, Mum.
Yeah, going to school I am, Mummy.

114
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,675
Yeah, all right, yeah."

115
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:32,058
Then I ended up in Houston, Texas.
Very proud... I'm a very proud Houstonian.

116
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,064
Super-proud Houstonian from Alief.

117
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,689
I'm for real.

118
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,528
But hold on, hold on. When I got there,
they put me in ESL class...

119
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,365
which is
English as a second language class,

120
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,618
and I was the only guy that spoke English
in this fuckin' class.

121
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
And my family sends me to school
with a vest and a bow tie,

122
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,624
thinking, "That's how you go to school."

123
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,419
No, that's how you get your ass whooped
at school in America.

124
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,091
I walk in, all the kids are looking at me
like, "Hola.

125
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,009
Amigo...

126
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,721
I was like...

127
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,016
"Sorry?

128
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,229
What language are you speaking?"

129
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,607
All of a sudden, this other dude
just comes up out of nowhere.

130
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,985
He's like, "You're weird, dude.

131
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,159
Golly, man!

132
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,619
Why do you talk like that?"

133
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,956
And that was my teacher.
You know, it was fucked up.

134
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,839
My family did no research.

135
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,633
Not one person thought of, like,

136
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,637
"Hey, what neighborhood
should we move into in Houston?

137
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,682
Let's just fucking go
to a bunch of gang violence.

138
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,100
That'll make sense."

139
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,562
It was very tough.
I didn't know what to do.

140
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,898
I was caught
in the middle of this gang battle.

141
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,233
There was a lot of Mexican gangs,
a lot of black gangs,

142
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,677
and they were fighting each other.

143
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,822
And the Mexican gangs wanted to recruit me
'cause they thought I was Mexican.

144
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,700
And there was a lot of black gangs.
They wanted...

145
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,203
They wanted to beat me up
'cause they thought I was Mexican.

146
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,038
Really tough high school years.

147
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:21,626
I'm, like, walkin' to school,
and I see these Latino gangs hangin' out,

148
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,462
and, obviously,
this guy has seen me before

149
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,796
and he'd just had it.

150
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,340
He just approaches me.

151
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,716
He was like, "Say, vato!

152
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,096
You walk by here every day.
You don't say nothin', don't do nothin'.

153
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,180
What?

154
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,060
You ashamed of your own peoples, bro?

155
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,981
You ashamed of your own people?
This is your familia, bro!

156
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,151
Your la raza, bro!
You ashamed of your own peoples, bro?

157
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,323
Andale, bro.
You going to get broke today, bro.

158
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,324
What's your name, bro?

159
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,659
Andale, what's your name?"

160
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,245
I was like, "Man,
my name is Mohammed." He's like, "What?

161
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,750
For real, bro?
You look exactly like Hector!

162
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,293
I swear to God, bro."

163
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,799
He was like, "Hector, Hector, come
check it out, dude! Check it out, bro!

164
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:13,553
We found your doppelganger.
Te lo juro, bro! Te lo juro!"

165
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,306
And the fucked-up part is Hector came out.

166
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,559
I was like,
"Holy shit, I do look like Hector!"

167
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,895
Started high-fivin' and shit.

168
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,982
I was like, "Yeah, we all look alike!
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

169
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,585
And then I saw some guns stickin' out.

170
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:31,028
I was like, "Shit, I need to
get the hell out of this situation."

171
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,114
And I did and I had a decent day.

172
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:39,036
I really did. And then, I'm going home
and I see the black gangs hangin' out

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,122
and I was like,
"Please. Please, not today.

174
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,666
I'm not emotionally prepared
to deal with this today.

175
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,293
Please, just not today!"

176
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:49,171
And, of course, they smelled that fear
from a mile away.

177
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:54,093
For real! And this guy comes up to me,
he was like, "Say, Jose!

178
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,015
You in the wrong
motherfuckin' neighborhood, Jose.

179
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,934
You done fucked up today, Jose!

180
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,353
Where your crew at, Jose?"

181
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,857
I'm lookin' around for Jose.
I'm like, "Who the hell is Jose?"

182
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,068
I was like, "Come on, man.
My name is Mohammed."

183
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:15,031
He goes, "Man! Salaam alaikum,
brother, shit, my bad!" You know?

184
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,081
I ended up selling all the gang members
fake Rolexes. I'm not gonna lie.

185
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,001
I was that Arab connect,
that's what I was.

186
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,796
It was really rough, man.
I had some rough times.

187
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,925
That's why you've gotta think of, like,
backup plans and exit strategies.

188
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,011
It's important.
I learned from being a refugee,

189
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,596
you've gotta have plan B and C and D.

190
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,514
That's why I learned Spanish.

191
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:45,686
Just in case some shit breaks out,
I can camouflage at any moment in time.

192
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,899
It's gettin' rough, man.
They start hunting Arabs and Muslims,

193
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,109
I don't know what'll happen.
They'll be like, chh-chh!

194
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:56,238
"Hey, boy!
Hey, boy, you one of them A-rabs?

195
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,201
You one of them Muslims?"
I'd be like, "No, vato, come on..."

196
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,496
"Sí.

197
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,958
Yo regreso a mi país, Mexico!"

198
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,543
And just get the fuck out of there.

199
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,546
Jump over that unfinished fence,
you know what I mean?

200
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,476
I've thought about it. I'll just
start selling falafel tacos, and...

201
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:30,356
Start a Halal Hermanos truck
in Ciudad de Mexico and shit.

202
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,778
Just be sitting there yelling, "Ay, salsa
verde con tahini sauce, puto, andale!"

203
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:39,615
Shakin' her head. It's all right!

204
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,953
She was like,
"That doesn't sound delicious at all."

205
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,460
Immigration is tough, you know.
They talk about this extreme vetting

206
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,837
and everything happening.

207
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,423
Look, it took me 20 years
to get my citizenship.

208
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:58,843
It took my mom almost 21 years.
Outrageously long.

209
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:02,722
20 years! Like, I didn't have a...
For ten of those 20 years,

210
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,351
I travelled the world
doing stand-up comedy without a passport.

211
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,771
Really difficult to pull off, by the way.

212
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,317
I had what they call
a refugee travel document

213
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,194
and on the front of this document,

214
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,531
it says, "Department
of Homeland Security." All right?

215
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:25,161
On the inside, in all caps, it says,
"This is not a US passport."

216
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,664
Confuses everybody that I interact with,

217
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,375
including the kiosk machine checkin' in,
right?

218
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:34,170
Like, you get a passport,
you scan your passport,

219
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,921
you get your boardin' pass and you out.

220
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,590
"Aah! Party! We're leavin'!" Right?

221
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,135
Well, my shit doesn't scan, so I have
to show up and be like, "Um...

222
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:44,972
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.
Can you please help me check in?"

223
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,057
She's like,
"Sir, please scan your passport."

224
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,852
"Yeah, I don't know why
you're yellin' at me. I just got here.

225
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:56,942
Yeah, I was here a week ago
and, it didn't scan, so I was just...

226
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,487
Can you please help me check in?"

227
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,071
"Sir, did you try it today?"

228
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,783
"That's a really good observation.
I didn't think about it today.

229
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,992
Maybe today, it works."

230
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,708
I scan my travel document.
A huge exclamation point comes up.

231
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,211
"Please seek help from representative."
"Excuse me, ma'am.

232
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,631
The Check Engine light just came on
on this damn thing. It's about to explode.

233
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,716
Can you please help me check in?"

234
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,719
She shows up. She's like,
"Sir, just give me your passport."

235
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,637
"God."

236
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,722
So I give it to her, she's like, "Okay.

237
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,933
Sir, this is not a passport."

238
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:32,311
I was like, "Yeah, I know. I've been
trying to talk to you since I got here.

239
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,941
See, it's a... it's a travel document,
so I can travel with it,

240
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,110
because there's visas issued
from the countries that I'm visiting

241
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,636
so obviously I can travel with it."

242
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:48,202
She's like, "Sir... this... is not...
a passport."

243
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,496
I was like, "I speak English perfectly,
ma'am.

244
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,706
I don't know why
you're talkin' to me this way.

245
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,919
See, in 1948,
the United Nations was founded

246
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,672
and in 1951, they had a Geneva Convention

247
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:03,634
and they created a Geneva passport
that allows refugees and asylees to travel

248
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,471
while they're seeking asylum
from their respective countries.

249
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,349
But you know what? I'm just gonna
blow up this whole fuckin' airport,

250
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,642
that's what I'm gonna do!

251
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,523
I mean, my God,
you're just makin' it really difficult

252
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,942
for me to maintain my ethics
in this situation, like...

253
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,319
I just wanna fucking go nuts, like...

254
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,614
Why are you making it so difficult
for me to be an ethical person?

255
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,575
Like, it's just
all these fuckin' roadblocks."

256
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,786
This is the beginning
of a 20-hour journey.

257
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,372
Can you imagine?
This is just checkin' in, all right?

258
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:37,793
This is just checkin'... Next...
"You need a passport..."

259
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,879
Next... "You need a passport..."

260
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:42,298
"1949, muh..."

261
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,383
Boom!

262
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,595
And then you get to the country,
you finally get there

263
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,389
and you think you're free and they go,
"Your questioning."

264
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,601
Every fucking... Every place,
there's questioning, interrogation.

265
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,479
Japan, by far my favorite interrogation
I've ever had in my life.

266
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,110
It was just an hour of them trying
to figure out what I did for a living.

267
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,693
The entire hour...

268
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:10,034
The entire hour consisted of,
"So, what is your occupation?"

269
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,995
I was like, "I'm a comedian."

270
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,078
"Comedian?"

271
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,750
"Yeah, yeah, I do stand-up comedy."

272
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,460
"Stand-up-a comed?"

273
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,380
I was like, "Yeah, man, I do comedy."

274
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,299
"Comed?"
"Yeah, I do stand-up comedy."

275
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,467
"Stand-up-a comed?"

276
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,761
"Yeah, I... I'm a comedian."
"Comedian?"

277
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,055
"Am I being roasted right now?
What's happening?"

278
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,353
"Like, what is going..."
Finally, his friend walks in.

279
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,396
I was so relieved somebody else walked in.

280
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,775
And he goes, "Hey. Hari-san-ye.
Ha-da-da. Comedian."

281
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,612
He goes, "Yeah, comedian!

282
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:50,491
He's like-Bill Cosby!"

283
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,620
And that's what got me off,
was Bill Cosby.

284
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,624
I mean, not literally, not literally.
But figuratively, I swear to God. Yes!

285
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,924
It's exhausting.

286
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,887
I went to England. England is probably
one of the toughest countries

287
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,847
to travel to if you don't have a passport.

288
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,975
Like, they've fucked the whole world

289
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,560
so they feel scared
that the shit's gonna come back to them.

290
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,855
So they are really protective
of everything.

291
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,191
Like, seriously,
check this out, all right?

292
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,318
Before you get a visa,
you gotta get fingerprints.

293
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,779
Get your visa, gotta get
confirmation of fingerprints.

294
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:34,535
Then you land in London
and they're like,"

295
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,246
"Hello, Mohammed, yeah.

296
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:42,626
We need your fumprints, yeah,
just one more time, your fumprints."

297
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,254
I was like, "You mean thumbprints?"

298
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,798
He was like, "That's what I said, yeah?
Fumprints.

299
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,387
Don't correct my English.
I speak the Queen's English."

300
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,681
I was like,
"Well, if that's the case,

301
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,599
why do you end sentences
with a question mark?

302
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,809
It's really frustrating."

303
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,937
I remember I was lost in London,
my phone was dead.

304
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,141
I was like, "Excuse me, sir,

305
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,308
can you please tell me
how to get to the Holiday Inn?"

306
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,902
And he's like, "Yeah, yeah, you just
walk down this street, yeah?

307
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,696
You make the first left, yeah?

308
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:15,409
Second right, yeah? And then the hotel's
gonna be on the left-hand side, innit?"

309
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:17,911
I'm like, "I don't know!
Is it, motherfucker? I'm lost!"

310
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,836
I love touring in England, right?
So I'm in Birmingham, UK, right?

311
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,547
I'm in Birmingham, UK.
I asked a guy in the front row,

312
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,150
I was like, "What part of England
are you from?" Being friendly.

313
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,427
And he lost his shit!

314
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,098
He was like, "I'm not British!
I'm Australian!

315
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,933
"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!"

316
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:42,978
And all these Australians popped up
like little fuckin' Minions.

317
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,605
"Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!"

318
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,191
I was like, "Shit!
Whoa! Hey, time out!"

319
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,528
Why is this so offensive? I mean...

320
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,490
I was like, "I'm sorry.
I didn't think it was offensive

321
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,784
to mistake an Australian
for being British."

322
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,038
I was like, "My God, man,
the British flag is inside of your flag!

323
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:05,751
It's in the top left-hand corner,
FaceTiming your flag."

324
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:16,303
"Aaaah..."

325
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,600
Flags are really fascinating.

326
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,022
No, they are. Flags are really, really
fascinating, 'cause if you look at them...

327
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:31,527
Just, like, you know, travelling the world
as a refugee free agent, I've just...

328
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:37,282
Just trying to decide which country
I'm gonna commit to, you know...

329
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:42,079
I was just like, "Man, flags are,
like, very tribal, you know?

330
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:45,666
So tribal and...
Almost like gang colors, you know?"

331
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,586
It seemed like,
just an observation, initially.

332
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,924
Red, white and blue
was intended for white gangs.

333
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,594
Just an observation, initially.

334
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,307
'Cause if you really look at it, England
is all red, white and blue stripes.

335
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,726
Just X'd out,
stripes all over it, X'd out.

336
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:07,521
Come to America, they're like,
"Straighten up them damn stripes!

337
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,356
Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah!

338
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,316
Put 50 stars on that sumbitch!

339
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,611
Pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah, pah!
America!" You know what I mean?

340
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,911
You go to Australia, they've got
the British flag inside of their flags.

341
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,998
They threw some stars in there
to let America know, "Don't hit me, OK?

342
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,083
Do not beat me up. I'm with you."

343
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,545
New Zealand followed suit
'cause they had no choice.

344
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,466
And Scandinavia's all red, white and blue
or variations of those colors.

345
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,594
Except Sweden.
Sweden's like, "We'll take ze blue,

346
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,345
but ve also vant ze yellow, okay?

347
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,805
Ve vant ze German yellow!"

348
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,309
"All right, give them the German yellow.
Jeez! Shut the fuck up, Sweden," you know?

349
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,353
France is red, white and blue.

350
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,230
Holland is red, white and blue.

351
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,754
I mean, my God, it just keeps going.

352
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,693
So is Russia.
Russia was red, white and blue, is today,

353
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,529
but for a while,
they were like the rogue white people.

354
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,698
They were like
the really rogue white people.

355
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,284
They were like, "No! No! Fuck you!

356
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:06,121
We will... We will not be red,
white and blue anymore, okay?

357
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,249
We will be Communist USSR Russia, okay?

358
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,835
We will take over surrounding countries

359
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,338
and we will be most powerful superpower.

360
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,090
Fuck you, okay? Vodka!"
You know what I mean? And then...

361
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,220
And then...
And then they had to submit at some point

362
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,138
and they were like, "Okay, okay, okay.

363
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,725
No more red flag
with yellow hammer sickle, okay.

364
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:31,980
Okay, we will give back independence
to surrounding countries, okay.

365
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,066
Every once in a while,
I will fuck Ukraine!

366
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,401
That's the deal. That's the deal.

367
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:43,825
We will go back to red, white and blue,
okay, okay.

368
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,328
We will be democratic as well.

369
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,456
Win elections by 99%,
but no one is counting, okay?

370
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,504
But in, like, 30 years,
we will infiltrate your electoral system

371
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,508
and give you the shittiest, weirdest
presidential experience you've ever had!

372
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,475
And don't forget about our secret weapon,

373
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,643
Kanye West."

374
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:15,857
It's weird.

375
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,819
I can see Kanye West in KGB meetings.

376
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,654
♪ She give me money...♪

377
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,739
"Do that one, Kanye, come on! Do that one.

378
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,866
I like that one!

379
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,952
♪ Give me money! ♪
I like that, it was good."

380
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,959
I remember I was being questioned
in London, right?

381
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,545
I'm waiting for him to come in
and question me, right?

382
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,381
And I'm sitting there
and I notice there's a poster on the wall

383
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,800
and there's a dog on this poster

384
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,721
and the dog has a passport
around his neck.

385
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:51,143
And the headline of the poster says,
"Get your pet citizenship today."

386
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,063
I was like, "This bitch can
get her citizenship in a day?"

387
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,691
And she was smiling at me,
like, "Hey, I got a passport!"

388
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:01,111
Just dangling there. I was like...
It was really wildly insulting.

389
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,323
I said to myself, "You know what?
When I get back to Houston,

390
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,617
I'm gonna call Immigration,
I'm gonna use my super-white voice."

391
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,703
'Cause that's how
I get shit done over the phone.

392
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,458
I use a super-white voice on the phone
to get late checkouts and whatever I want.

393
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,959
That's what I do. I'm serious!

394
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,545
So I call up Immigration

395
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,965
and the lady answers the phone
with an attitude right out of the gate.

396
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,386
She was like, "Hi! Hi, INS.
What can I do for you today?"

397
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,138
I was like, "Hi, um...

398
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,307
Yes, hi.

399
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:34,728
I've been in the States, I don't know,
about, 17 years at this point

400
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,732
and, I'm trying to see
if I can speed up my citizenship process."

401
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,610
She goes, "Okay, baby.
Let me look up your file here.

402
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,905
What's your last name?"

403
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,990
I was like, "My last name?

404
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,575
My last name is Amer."

405
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,495
"" "A-M-E-R.

406
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,247
It's almost like America
without the 'ica.' ha-ha-ha!

407
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,631
"That's cute, baby. That's real cute.

408
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,509
But what's your first name?"

409
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:07,928
"My... my first name?

410
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,848
My first name is Mohammed."

411
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,935
"Quit playin', baby!
No, really, what's your first name?"

412
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,396
I'm like, "That is my first name!"

413
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,690
She's like, "You ain't gonna
get your citizenship, baby.

414
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:30,951
Please hold."

415
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,953
I was like,
"What the fuck just happened to me?"

416
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,872
This lady puts me on hold
and the hold music was...

417
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,959
♪ Never gon' get it
Never gon' get it, never gon'... ♪

418
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,132
And then she picked up the phone
real quick and goes, "Whoo-whoo-whoo!"

419
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,008
And hangs up. I was like, "Shit!"

420
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:55,183
Immigration's tough. When it comes...
When it comes down to it,

421
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:58,687
like, towards the end of
the immigration process, it's very easy.

422
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,273
You just have to
take an American history exam, okay?

423
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,985
It's really, really easy. The thing is,
I didn't see it come together like this.

424
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,904
Check this out.
The lady who's giving this exam...

425
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,217
She's originally Chinese, which is fine,
but she had a really thick Chinese accent.

426
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:14,361
Which is fine, also. I just didn't see it
coming together like this at the end.

427
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:17,497
She was more excited for me
than I was for myself.

428
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:22,502
I turned the corner and she was like,
"Today big day!

429
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,129
Today big day!"

430
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,214
I was like... "Um...

431
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,261
Is this the American citizenship office?"

432
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,264
She's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you in the right place.

433
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:37,809
Come in, come in, come in,
sit down, sit down, sit down!"

434
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:42,314
Wow!
She goes, "Okay, fuh question."

435
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,857
I was like, "What?

436
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,486
Did you just say, 'Fuck question'?"

437
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,198
She didn't even stutter.
She was like, "Yeah, fuh question."

438
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:58,830
She goes, "OK, who the fuh president
of the United States?" I was like...

439
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,045
I was like, "Bush."

440
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,506
She was like, "Correct!"

441
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,218
Says, "Come on, I know you praying.
I look at your file.

442
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,179
You been waiting here 20 year.

443
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,224
Here's a Mohammed key chain.
Congratulation! Get out of here."

444
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,309
I was like, ""

445
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,733
It was dope. It was that fast.

446
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,777
It was like,
"My God, this is so easy,"

447
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,112
and then she goes,
"No, no, you have to go to interview."

448
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,951
And it's just like one more interrogation
for old times' sake, you know?

449
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,330
Standing out there,
I got to know this guy named Javier.

450
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:43,458
We became really close. We were
both nervous together.I'm like...

451
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,835
"Hi, Javier,
you doing good, my friend?"

452
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,423
"Yes, I'm well, but I'm really nervous."

453
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,593
"Yeah. Me too, my friend, me too."

454
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,971
"I've been waiting here two hours.

455
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:58,056
I don;t know what's going on,
but I'm nervous."

456
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,684
"I am too, I am too."

457
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,311
All of a sudden, the door opens up.

458
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,814
"Come on in."

459
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,776
"Me or Javier?"

460
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,029
"You, sir. Please, come on in."

461
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,730
"He's pointing at me, Javier."

462
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,865
"Be careful."

463
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,706
"Sit down." "Okay."

464
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,709
"Please answer yes or no
to the following questions."

465
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,042
"Okay.

466
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,754
I mean yes. No. Whatever.

467
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,214
I'm just nervous."

468
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,011
"'Fuck' question.

469
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,101
Have you or anybody else you know
been involved with

470
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:52,402
or given funds to from the time period
of 1933 to 1945 with the Nazi Party?"

471
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:53,820
I was like, "What?"

472
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,240
I was like, "You're kidding!
I thought you were serious, man.

473
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,409
You had me so nervous."
"Please answer yes or no."

474
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,870
"No, I was not involved
with the Nazi Party whatsoever, man.

475
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,835
I wasn't even born.
I don't know what you're talking about."

476
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,256
"Next question.

477
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,508
Have you or anybody else you know
been involved with

478
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:19,304
or given funds to any terrorist
organizations, Mr. Mohammed?"

479
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,686
Super-racist!
I was like, "No, of course not.

480
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:31,316
And I have to ask you a question.
Who the hell says yes?" Okay?

481
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,152
Seriously, it baffles my mind.

482
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,614
Is this an effective method
of capturing terrorists worldwide?

483
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,117
I mean, did you catch somebody off-guard
at some point?

484
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,704
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Have you been sittin' there like,

485
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,582
'Have you or anybody else you know
been involved with any terrorist... '

486
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,627
'You got me!

487
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,132
You are so tricky, you know?

488
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:00,178
Two more minutes, I was gonna kill
all you mother-bitches, you know?

489
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,307
Here's the bomb.

490
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,831
All right, all right, all right,
take it, take it, all right."

491
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,816
"Hey, cut the green wire, okay?

492
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,985
I'm just kidding.
The blue wire, all right?"

493
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,114
"I don't know!'"

494
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,292
Germany was probably the most interesting
without my passport, you know.

495
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,170
Such a relief to have it now,
but, man, Germany was, like,

496
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:38,133
I get there and the guy's like,
"Ja, ja, velcome to Germany. Can I...

497
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,261
Can I please have your passport, please?"

498
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,015
I'm like, "Yeah, sure. Here you go."
He's like, "Ja, is good, ja.

499
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,728
I look very special, ja?

500
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:59,362
Noooo! Nooo!

501
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,365
I say,
'Can I have your passport, please?'"

502
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,492
I'm like, "Hey, man, that is my passport."

503
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,411
"Vell, it cannot be your passport."

504
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:07,829
"Well, it is my passport."

505
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,914
"Vell, it cannot be your passport."

506
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,791
"Well, it is my passport."

507
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,668
"Vell, it cannot be your passport."

508
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,378
"Well, it is my passport!"

509
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,924
"Vell, it says here
it's not a passport, ja?

510
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,309
It shows here you are born in Kuwait, ja?

511
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,644
Can I please have your Kuwaiti passport?"

512
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,397
I was like,
"Man, I don't have a Kuwaiti passport."

513
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:37,525
He's like
"Vy don't you have a Kuwaiti passport!"

514
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,110
I was like, "Relax, okay?

515
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,113
In Kuwait, it doesn't matter
if you're born there.

516
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,837
It matters where your parents come from."

517
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,993
He goes, "Ja.
Well, vere do your parents come from?"

518
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,787
I was like, "My parents are Palestinian."

519
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,998
He goes,
"Vell, give me your Palestinian passport."

520
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,376
I was like, "Bro, I don't have
a Palestinian passport!"

521
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,463
"Well, vy don't you have
a Palestinian passport?"

522
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,590
I was like,
" 'Cause Palestine's not a state!"

523
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,968
He goes, "Well, vy don't you
make it a state? "I was like, "What?

524
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,848
Have you not read the news
the last 70 years?

525
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,684
And by the way, I'm in Germany.

526
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,103
This is all your fucking fault
to begin with!"

527
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,656
I thought I was gonna go to jail,
I really did.

528
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,282
His reaction shocked me.

529
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,661
He goes, "Ja, it's true, ja,"
and just stamps my shit.

530
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,496
I was like, "Thank you!"

531
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,041
The most incredible experience.

532
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:39,546
So nice for somebody to admit
that they're wrong immediately, you know?

533
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,926
Germany was fine. It was easy,
I got through, it was great.

534
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:48,096
But you'd think
the Middle East would be easier on me,

535
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,889
but it's much worse, you know.

536
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,474
It's 'cause I have family there.

537
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:53,977
That's the thing about Arabs.

538
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,437
You've gotta come back
with, like, 15 suitcases.

539
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:03,278
It's like this Arab protocol
that your mom sends, like, a telegram

540
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,041
or whatever they still send to each other.

541
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,615
I'm serious. They send something,
you just walk in

542
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,868
and your aunt's just packing
everything for you, right?

543
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,537
It's just terrible. And
there's this one thing top of the list.

544
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,373
It's called mulukhiyah.
It's like spinach, but it's not spinach.

545
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,668
It's better than spinach
and Arabs love this stuff, okay?

546
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:24,173
And I walk in and my aunt is putting it
in clear plastic bags and then taping it.

547
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:25,257
I'm like...

548
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:29,470
I'm like, "This is... What are you doing?
I'm... What are you doing?"

549
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,055
"I'm taping it so it stays fresh."

550
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,819
I was like, "Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

551
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,059
But it looks like weed, Auntie!
This is terrible!"

552
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,315
Straight up looks like
bricks of marijuana.

553
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,693
I'm like, "This is not good for me,
all right?"

554
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:47,113
She goes, "Don't worry, we'll pray
for you. You'll get there." I was like...

555
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,407
"I mean, I'll take it."

556
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,077
And then my uncle walks in
with olive oil, okay?

557
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:56,456
Olive oil is the second most important
thing on the list, maybe the first.

558
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,750
But olive oil, you gotta...
It's illegal.

559
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,668
I can't... I can't take it back.

560
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,338
My uncle's walkin' in
with, like, so many bottles of olive oil.

561
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:04,661
I'm like, "What are you doing?"

562
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,514
He goes,
"You're gonna take it back with you."

563
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,594
I was like, "Yeah, I see what
you're doing, but I can't take it back.

564
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,931
It's illegal to take olive oil
back to America."

565
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,223
He goes, "Don't worry.

566
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,518
We will take off the label
and we will write 'olive juice.'"

567
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:18,728
This is his strategy.

568
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,148
I'm traveling back to America

569
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,485
with what looks like
three suitcases of marijuana

570
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:29,948
and olive juice and God knows
what other spices and goods are in my bag.

571
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,031
I didn't even know.

572
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,079
I somehow make it out of Tel Aviv
into New York City, all right?

573
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,497
I get to New York,

574
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,083
and you know how you wanna beat
everybody in Immigration

575
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,168
to get to be the first guy out, you know?

576
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,087
And I was like, "Yeah, I'm the first guy!"

577
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,547
And there was four Immigration officers.
"You, come here."

578
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,175
I was like,
"I've heard this voice before." You know?

579
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:50,843
I was still being naive.

580
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,638
I was like, "Maybe...
Maybe this is random. Maybe..."

581
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,933
I really did.
I was like, "Maybe it's random,"

582
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:59,769
and then they opened up a piece of paper
with my picture on it.

583
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,814
I was like, "This is definitely
not random! Some real shit!"

584
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,858
It was horribly embarrassing.
I'm the first guy off

585
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,702
and they're waiting
for everybody to get off.

586
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:11,322
So everybody's walkin' off,
like, "Ooh! Ooh!

587
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,743
"Oooh!"
I'm like, "Fuck you! You

588
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,495
"I didn't do shit." You know what I mean?

589
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,956
And then they separate me from everybody,
finally,

590
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,292
and then take me to a whole nother room,
and they were waitin' for my bags.

591
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,713
All my bags are sittin' out,
and I was like, "Man, here we go."

592
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,674
And the Immigration officer comes
to open up one of the bags.

593
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:34,679
I was like, "Please, just don't
let it be the mulukhiyah, just please!"

594
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,306
And of course it is.
He opens it up, he almost faints.

595
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,433
He's like...

596
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,436
Like that. And he goes,
"Bring the dog!" Like this.

597
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,981
And, first of all, Arabs don't
do well with dogs, okay? Number one.

598
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:48,860
Number two, this is the most legit dog
I have ever seen in my life.

599
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,779
This fucking dog had a bulletproof vest,

600
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,866
a badge and a passport
around its fucking neck!

601
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,951
I'm sick of these dogs!

602
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:06,085
The dog was cocky and arrogant.
He was just like, "Yeah."

603
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,463
He was so cocky,
I attached a voice to him.

604
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,966
All I could hear was Eddie Murphy's voice
as the donkey in Shrek.

605
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,509
Now, he was... I'm for real!

606
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,597
He was walking by like, "Yeah, yeah,
you going to jail today, Mohammed! Yeah!

607
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,769
If we don't find nothing, we'll probably
put something in there for your ass."

608
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,062
Right? He just walks up.

609
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,606
I was horrified.
I didn't pack this myself.

610
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,489
I know it's mulukhiyah, but maybe not.
What the fuck are they gonna do?

611
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,693
And the dog gets to my bag.

612
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,154
He's the most confident dog,
and within a matter of seconds,

613
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,239
he becomes the most confused dog.

614
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,158
He's sitting there, like...

615
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,580
"I don't know, man!
It looks like weed, but it's not weed.

616
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,833
I don't know what to do!
You wanna sniff it, Doug? I don't know."

617
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,335
He just keeps scratching.

618
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,838
Finally, he stops, urinates on my bag...

619
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,424
and then walks away.

620
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:57,470
I was like, "My God,
I just witnessed a dog quit its job, man!"

621
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,264
Amazing!

622
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,021
I got in with everything.

623
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,816
My uncle misspelled "olive juice."

624
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,487
I swear, the Immigration officer
read it like, "I love Jews."

625
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,572
And I just went right through.
I'm serious.

626
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,325
Went right through.

627
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,247
And, look, the olive oil we make
and we bring over,

628
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,082
we don't just consume it.

629
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,167
Yeah, we... we bathe in it, you know?

630
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,753
That's what Arabs do, man.

631
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,421
We just use it for everything.

632
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,341
It's funny, 'cause my mom
always wanted me to be a doctor.

633
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,386
But it's very difficult
to get her to go to the doctor.

634
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,345
And I figured it out.

635
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,973
It's because our medicine is olive oil,
that's why,

636
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,100
and we diagnose ourselves.

637
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,687
The diagnosis
is always called lafhet hawa, OK?

638
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,315
If you don't know what this is, it
translates to "a brisk wind," all right?

639
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,234
It literally translates to "a brisk wind."

640
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,320
You have lafhet hawa, "a brisk wind,"
that's why you got sick

641
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,990
and then you just bathe in olive oil
and take a shot of it,

642
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,575
that's the... that's the protocol.

643
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:05,204
So one morning, I wake up with
something called Bell's palsy, okay?

644
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,040
Exactly. If you don't know what this is,

645
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:11,043
this is when
one half of your face quits working.

646
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,255
I just woke up one morning,
trying to brush my teeth

647
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,300
and one half of my face
is not cooperating.

648
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,594
I'm sitting there like, "...

649
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:22,054
"No..."

650
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,433
I was like, "Mama?
Mama, thomething ith really wrong."

651
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,643
She goes, "What's wrong, habibi?"

652
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,229
I'm like, " 'What's wrong, habibi?'
Are you theriouth?

653
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,108
Half of my fathe ith not working, Mom."

654
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,527
She goes,
"Don't worry, it's just lafhet hawa."

655
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,447
I'm like,
"A brithk wind did thith to my fathe?

656
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,534
I wath in bed all night, Mom.

657
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,454
There's no wind in my room.

658
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,582
I thaid there's no wind in my room."

659
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,169
She goes, "Don't worry."
She grabs some olive oil, smacks my face,

660
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,047
and goes... says a prayer,
and she goes, "You're healed!"

661
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,174
I'm like, "I'm not healed, Mom.

662
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,093
I'm a greasy freak, that's all! I just..."

663
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,430
My entire family thought
I was overreacting.

664
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,641
"You're overreacting!"
"I'm overreacting?

665
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,044
Half of my fucking fathe is not working,
I'm being a pussy?

666
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,228
Is that what you're thaying?

667
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,231
I'm the pussy.
Is that what you're thaying?"

668
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,441
They're like, "Yeah."

669
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,069
I had to drive myself
to the emergency room.

670
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,530
'Cause we're so gangsta.
I get to the emergency room,

671
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,334
the guy looks at me,
goes, "Can I help you?"

672
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,867
I'm like, "I hope tho."

673
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:28,246
Then he goes, "What's the problem?"

674
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,665
I'm like, "What's the problem?
Are you theriouth right now?

675
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,833
You talk to my mom or thomething?

676
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,835
What the hell do you mean,
'What's the problem?'

677
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:39,006
No, you know what? I woke up this morning
and I thaid to mythelf,

678
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,675
'You know what would be really cool?

679
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:44,720
You know what's gonna make me
thtand out from the cwowd?

680
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,933
If I could just try to talk
with one half of my face!'"

681
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:53,521
He goes, "My God, man,
half of your face is not working.

682
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,398
It could be a stroke.

683
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:56,774
Walk back and forth."

684
00:37:56,857 --> 00:38:00,569
I was like, "Stroke? Okay! Okay!

685
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,613
Is it a stroke?"

686
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,574
He goes, "I don't know. I'm not a doctor."
I was like, "What?

687
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,329
Take me to a doctor, you asshole!"

688
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,665
He takes me back there.

689
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,085
I'm so scared. I'm sittin' there,
the doctor comes in.

690
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,796
He's like, "Can I help you?"
I'm like, "What do you mean?

691
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,131
Nobody talked to you already?

692
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,135
We're in Houston, the most pwogwessive
healthcare thystem in the entire world,

693
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,345
nobody communicates with anybody here?

694
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,725
Hey, fella, half of my face
is not working, OK?"

695
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,143
He goes, "My God, man!

696
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,604
It could be a stroke.
Walk back and forth."

697
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,107
I'm like, "You'd better be a doctor,
I thwear to God.

698
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,860
I'll blow up this whole fucking hospital!
I'll do it!"

699
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,450
He's like, "You're fine, man.
It's not a stroke."

700
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:49,952
I'm like, "How can you say I'm fine?

701
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,122
Thank you for confirming
it's not a stroke,

702
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:58,085
but half of my fathe is not working,
tho what is it?"

703
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,088
He goes, "I have no idea.
I'll be back in 15 minutes."

704
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,342
Finally, the doctor comes back in.

705
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,262
He's like, "Mohammed...
Mohammed, we've diagnosed it."

706
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,805
I was like, "Okay, Doctor.

707
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,809
Don't be scared, Doctor.
Just tell me what it is. Don't be scared!"

708
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,272
He's like, "Mohammed,
we've diagnosed it as Bell's palsy."

709
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,356
"My God..."

710
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,111
"I have Bell's palsy?

711
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,531
What the hell is Bell's palsy?"

712
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:33,162
He goes, "Bell's palsy is when
one half of your face quits working."

713
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,289
I'm like, "I know what happened!

714
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,001
But why? Why does it happen?"

715
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,711
He goes, "A brisk wind, that's why."

716
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,213
I'm like, "Are you theriouth?"

717
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,346
My family made fun of me for a while.
It was great.

718
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,265
My family is fun, though.
I mean, my family is great.

719
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:58,604
They're everything to me and, you know,
we have the worst luck. We really do.

720
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,564
We have the worst luck. Check this out.

721
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,693
I have a brother, Omar,
who happened to become a pilot.

722
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,572
I'm like, "Solid career choice, Omar!
Solid career choice!"

723
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,366
No, he's doing great.

724
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,700
The FBI came over our house.

725
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,786
We squared everything up.
Everything's fine.

726
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,789
No, they really did.
The FBI came to our house,

727
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,375
or as my uncle calls them, the "Fibby,"
no joke.

728
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:23,587
Looked me with a straight face.
He goes, "Hey! The Fibby's coming!"

729
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,964
I'm like, "Who?"

730
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,799
He's like, "The Fibby!

731
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:28,968
The Fibby!"

732
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,331
I'm like, "What are you saying?"

733
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,847
He starts to act it out.
"The Fibby, you know? The Fibby!"

734
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,851
I'm like... We figured it out eventually.

735
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,146
He's the same uncle
that can't say "pharmacy."

736
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,606
He says "paharmacy" 100% of the time.

737
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,776
The most brilliant man I know.

738
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:48,612
He's like, "I have a chest infection.
Take me to the 'parhamacy.'"

739
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,781
I was like,
"You mean 'pharmacy.'"

740
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,450
He's like, "You're so stupid, okay?

741
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,578
There's a P in front of the 'harmacy!'"

742
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,955
I was like, "Yeah, that's... that's true."

743
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,083
And I have a nephew named Osama, okay?

744
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,461
I mean, what this poor kid had to endure!

745
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,672
I hate that fact. There's so many
terrorist acts done by white people,

746
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,674
not a single person
is changing their kid's name

747
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,134
from being Timothy, right?

748
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,343
It's fucking insane!

749
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,638
This poor kid!

750
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,894
This kid has to deal with so much,
I can only imagine.

751
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,271
Like, his ninth birthday was an obstacle.

752
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,982
I walked up to him
after the party was over.

753
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,485
I saw he had a new Xbox, only one game.

754
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,112
We're in Houston. I was like,
"Hey, buddy, let's go to Walmart.

755
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,072
I'll buy you all the games you want."

756
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,033
He was like, "Yeah!"

757
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:38,245
When we get to Walmart, man,
he's nine years old.

758
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,623
He's running away.

759
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,333
I can't call him.

760
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,463
I'm sitting there like, "Hey, Osa...

761
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,550
Pssssssst!

762
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,552
Pssssst!

763
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,638
"Sammy!" That's a good one.

764
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,057
"Hey, Sammy, come here!"

765
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,893
And whatever he was goin' through
just bubbled up to the surface.

766
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:05,272
He was like, "No! My name's Osamaaaaa!"

767
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,107
I'm like, "Shut up!" You know?

768
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,197
I just got the fuck out of there.

769
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,538
I mean, you gotta have backup plans,
you know?

770
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,706
You've gotta be ready.

771
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,042
It was tough, you know?

772
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,419
You know,
I did a lot of shows for US troops,

773
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,837
like a lot of entertainers do.

774
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,549
I did over, like,
100 military bases worldwide.

775
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,972
I wanted to experience it for myself

776
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,266
and I wanted to go just...
just see it for myself.

777
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,976
I wanted to show them
a new perspective.

778
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,645
I'm sure no Arab comedian's
ever done it before.

779
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,606
So I... Especially a refugee.
I wasn't even a citizen yet.

780
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,734
I was out there doing 'em,
and then they asked me...

781
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,528
they asked me to go to Kuwait and Iraq

782
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,322
And I was like, "Um...

783
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,993
I'm like,
"That's where my family fled from.

784
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:04,582
You want me to go back,
voluntarily, into a war zone

785
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,501
that we fled from 20 years previous?

786
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:09,211
I'll do it." And...

787
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,549
These psychological wounds
needed to get dealt with, you know?

788
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,885
I wanted to go see things for myself,
'cause, look, when we left...

789
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,138
when we left Kuwait, it was quite abrupt.

790
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,766
My father, God rest in peace,
he... he was doing very well.

791
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,977
He was in telecommunications,
he did very well,

792
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,479
and when the war happened,
all the money was gone.

793
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:29,940
Phwoo! Everything disappeared. Phwoo!

794
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,401
Lives changed forever. Bam! Erased.

795
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:36,488
Everybody's panicked, but the only person
that wasn't panicked was my mom.

796
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,992
We're like, "Why? We don't have any money.
Why aren't you panicked, Mom?"

797
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:43,871
She's like, "We have money." We're like,
"What? Well, like, how much money?"

798
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:47,082
"I don't know, maybe thousands.
I don't know, maybe. I don't know. Maybe.

799
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,208
Give or take, thousands."

800
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,170
I was like, "Give or take, thousands?"
My mom had her own exit strategy

801
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,505
just in case some shit went wrong
with Dad, apparently.

802
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:01,055
But she had to get my sister
and myself out

803
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,183
and the plan was we were gonna take
whatever money that my mom had

804
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:07,436
and we were gonna get on a bus
and this bus was gonna take us to Baghdad,

805
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,896
Baghdad to Amman, Jordan,

806
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:11,607
and then a few weeks later,
we were gonna fly to Houston, Texas.

807
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,442
But it's not that simple, okay?

808
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:17,029
We found out that if they found
anything valuable on you, okay,

809
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,656
they were just gonna take it from you.

810
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,868
So my mom grabs a razor, opens up
her purse... I'll never forget this.

811
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,120
She cuts a perfect line behind each zipper

812
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,539
and puts equal amounts of money
on each side

813
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,792
and then sews it up perfectly
like nothin' happened.

814
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:33,045
I was like, "My God,
my mother is a gangsta!" And then...

815
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,256
And then she made two custom money belts,

816
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,592
one for herself and one for my sister,

817
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,637
'cause the odds of searching women
are very, very low.

818
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,890
Then we started leaving. We get on this
bus and my mom finds a little money.

819
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:48,519
She's like, "What am I gonna do? She puts
it in the lining of this suitcase.

820
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:50,896
It's a little lazy, but she does it.
And then...

821
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,732
It's too late, it's true.

822
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,318
She'll tell you. We get on the bus,
we start leaving.

823
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,486
Life is changing forever.

824
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:59,613
This is a really traumatic moment
in my life.

825
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,950
We started leaving. We get to Baghdad
and we're looking out the window

826
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,536
and they're just breaking the suitcases.

827
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:08,580
They're just ripping 'em apart,
slashing them, going for it.

828
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,748
They were hip to shit.

829
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,632
My mom looks out the window.
She goes, "They're gonna find that money."

830
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:16,797
And then we look at my sister.
She has zero gangsta skills.

831
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,133
She is sweating profusely.

832
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,220
She's about to sell everybody the fuck out
for sure, okay?

833
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,140
I'm telling you,
if anybody walked up to her,

834
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,183
"Is there something we need to know,
little lady?"

835
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,227
"We have money!"

836
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,981
She was about to... God love her.

837
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:36,817
She was so scared.
And my mom palms her head

838
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,236
like she wants to crush a watermelon,
but she loves her.

839
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,321
You know, like, "Aww."

840
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:44,491
"Awww! Aww!

841
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,494
"Aw, aw, aw!

842
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,538
She goes, "Listen, okay?

843
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,082
Grab your brother
and get the hell away from me, okay?

844
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,085
'Cause if they see your face, they'll know
immediately, all right?"

845
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,880
So we're like, "Whatever,"
letting my mom do her thing, right?

846
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,299
We walk off the bus,
and my mom opens the suitcase,

847
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,760
a little bit of money,
she messes up all the clothes

848
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,721
and she throws some orange peels
all over it, some trash all over it,

849
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,223
and we just walk out the bus
and we're waiting.

850
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,685
Some time goes by,
and we start walking back on the bus.

851
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,562
Well, an Iraqi soldier sees my mother.

852
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,273
He was like, "Hey, lady, I don't think
you ever got off the bus.

853
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:18,358
What the hell absolves you
from getting searched?"

854
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,196
And he starts berating my mother,
saying some really horrible shit to her,

855
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,281
and then his superior officer sees him.

856
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,451
He gets upset with him.
He grabs him, puts him up against a wall.

857
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:31,455
He's like, "What's wrong with you?
How could you talk to this woman this way?

858
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,373
Look at her bag, you dummy!

859
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:36,543
It's in shambles.
It's obviously been searched already.

860
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,378
And look at this woman's face.

861
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,672
This is not a face of a liar."

862
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:43,675
And then he grabs him,
kicks him off the bus,

863
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,720
and then he apologized to my mother.

864
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,099
And all I could think of is,
"Damn! My mother is a gangsta!"

865
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,730
I love you, Mama.

866
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,816
I love you, Mama.

867
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:04,738
That's Mama right there.
That's gangsta right there.

868
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,786
Yeah. This is all for you. I love you.

869
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,832
I love you.

870
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,128
That's it. And that's how we got here.

871
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,964
There's so many people with these stories.

872
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,967
Everybody just wants a future
and something to look forward to

873
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:28,011
and be good about it and try to create
something special for themselves.

874
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:32,015
And now I had to go back to Kuwait
and Iraq to revisit this entire thing.

875
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,977
I'm staying in Saddam Hussein's palace,
using his bidet,

876
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,395
who kicked us out to begin with.

877
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,355
This is such a weird-ass experience!

878
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:42,109
It was really so much to handle.
And it's so weird.

879
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:45,863
You just get on this chopper,
you land at some undisclosed location.

880
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:49,157
You get out with two other comedians
and they're like, "Dance, bitch!"

881
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:53,120
You're like, "What's goin' on, everybody?"
It's crazy! It's crazy!

882
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,581
It's really weird. It's really weird.

883
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,625
This one particular base
was a lot more dangerous than the rest.

884
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,377
We heard gunshots in the distance

885
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,380
and I was like, "Hey, guys,
are we still doing a show?"

886
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,466
They're like, "Yep, in front
of that bomb shelter." I was like, "Okay."

887
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,094
"Good location, I guess..."

888
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,180
And I was closing out this show,

889
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:16,059
and the two other comedians go up
before me, and they hated 'em.

890
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,437
I was like,
"My God, these guys are hilarious!\

891
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,397
What the hell is gonna happen to me?"

892
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,190
So I started giving myself a pep talk.

893
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,692
I was like, "Hey, man."

894
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,695
"You need to go up there
and just be real, okay?

895
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,865
Just be in their grill and be real,
be yourself!"

896
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:32,451
I was like,
"Yeah. Yeah, that's a good strategy!"

897
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,829
So they introduce me, I go onstage.

898
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,790
I was like, "Hey, guys,
I know they introduced me as Mo,

899
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,354
but it's actually short for Mohammed!

900
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,252
Surprise, bitches! Today's the day!"

901
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,589
"Aaaaaah!"

902
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:47,912
It was a horrible strategy.
It was a really bad strategy.

903
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,181
I'm not gonna lie. Everything...
I have this filmed, right?

904
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,266
I have this on tape. Everybody laughed.

905
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,227
I cracked them. "Ha-ha-ha!"
They started laughing, lost their shit,

906
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,312
except one guy.

907
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,522
He grabs his M16 so fast, he's like, whoo!

908
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,608
"What the hell's goin' on, man?"

909
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,068
Like that, I swear.

910
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,446
And then he had an Alabama flag
tattooed on his arm.

911
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,741
Underneath it, it says,
"The South will rise again."

912
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,786
I was like, "My God, this guy thinks
he's fighting in the Civil War?

913
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,245
What the fuck is goin' on?"

914
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,208
So being from Texas, being from the South,

915
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,960
I wanted to give him something relatable.

916
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:27,631
I was like, "Hey, man! Hey, man!
Relax, baby! Relax, baby!

917
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,967
I'm from the South too, man!
Hey, hey, hey!"

918
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,970
♪ Boot scootin' boogie ♪
Unh!

919
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:36,348
"Hey, man, barbecue!"

920
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,685
I don't even know why I said it.
I just panicked like a little bitch.

921
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,103
I had nothing else to say.

922
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,200
I just kept repeating the same damn thing.

923
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,483
I was like, "Hey, hey, barbecue, man!
Hey!"

924
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,861
And it hypnotized him
and it neutralized the entire situation.

925
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,446
I'm not even kidding.

926
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,746
It was great. I had a very...
It was a great, great show.

927
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,510
The other comedians were like,
"That was solid." I was like, "Yeah!"

928
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,543
And then we started walking off the base

929
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:07,546
and the sergeant looks at me
and the two other comedians

930
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,423
and he goes, "Hey, fellas...

931
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,676
Make sure to remove your name tags...

932
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,721
'cause we don't want you
to get kidnapped."

933
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,806
I was like, "Shit!

934
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,017
We could get kidnapped?"

935
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,560
I started to freak out again.

936
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:24,146
I was like, "What am I doing here?"
I started sweating again.

937
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,982
And I was like,
"Hold on, Mo. You're in Iraq.

938
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,443
You look like everybody else there.

939
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,237
If anybody's gonna get kidnapped,

940
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:35,824
it's probably these two
very white comedians I'm working with."

941
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:41,371
If some terrorist were to left field us
and just hop out of a van

942
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:45,876
like, "Hey! Hey, this is a kidnapping!
Get your asses in the van,"

943
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,461
I'd be like, "Habibi!"

944
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,310
"I'm sorry, guys!"

945

♪ A-woo-woo-woo ♪
No, I'm just kidding.

946
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,569
I would never!

947
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:19,159
I like white people laughing at that.
It's great.

948
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,828
It's always the best.
It takes the edge off.

949
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,874
You know, I've just been
maneuvering the system so long

950
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,960
and workin' through
so many different things for so long

951
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:32,547
that I just get out of predicaments
naturally at this point.

952
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,675
At this... Look, check this out.
So I'm in Houston.

953
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,969
I'm driving on this two-lane highway.

954
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:41,181
It's the middle of the night.
I can't see a damn thing.

955
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:42,724
I miss the exit

956
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,895
so I start making this illegal U-turn
in the middle of the highway.

957
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,774
I know. An Arab move, I get it.

958
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:53,860
I am who I am, all right?

959
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,446
I start driving up.
Houston's got a lot of ditches.

960
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:59,741
I was like, "There's a ditch!"
So I put the car in reverse.

961
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,577
As I'm doing so, I see this car speeding.

962
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,080
Just coming up out of nowhere.
I was like, "Holy shit!"

963
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:09,501
And the guy barely misses me and skids off
and crashes into a ditch. Chhhh!

964
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:13,505
I was like, "My God,
I almost got killed! That was so stupid!"

965
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:17,008
I was like, "My God, Mo,
this guy is still in a ditch.

966
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,301
Hopefully he's OK."

967
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,097
And then he drives out of the ditch
and he parks behind me.

968
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,225
I was so damn relieved.

969
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,561
And then he turns on his police lights!

970
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,981
Okay? I'm Mohammed in Texas

971
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,275
with a substantial amount of marijuana
in my possession.

972
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,986
This is a very bad situation for me.

973
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,698
The cop comes up to me, cursing furiously.

974
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,325
He's like,
"What the fuck is wrong with you?

975
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:43,618
You're an idiot!"

976
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,246
I was like, "Yes, sir.
Hard to disagree, sir.

977
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,331
That was really, really stupid.
I'm an idiot."

978
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,293
"Yeah, you're right it was stupid.
It was real stupid.

979
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,170
What the hell were you thinkin'?"

980
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:56,256
I was like,
"Sir, sir, obviously I was not thinking.

981
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,593
I was not thinking. I'm so sorry.
I was not thinking."

982
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:01,970
And then he knew he was speeding,

983
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,848
he knew he was, like,
double the damn speed limit

984
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,683
so he started feeling guilty himself.

985
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:10,937
He was like, "Man. Man,
I could have fucking killed you!"

986
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,732
Like, "My God,
I could have really killed you!"

987
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,360
Like, "I don't know how...
I don't know how I didn't kill you!"

988
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,446
I was like, "I know how.

989
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,700
It's 'cause of our lord and savior,
Jesus Christ, that's why."

990
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:35,670
And he goes,
"You right, son. You right, son.

991
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,172
Praise Jesus!"

992
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:39,549
I was like, "Praise Jesus!"

993
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:41,635
He's like, "Praise Jesus!"

994
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,679
I was like, "Praaaaise Jesus!

995
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,102
"Praise Jesus!"

996
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:55,440
And then he goes, "Can I have
your driver's license, please, son,

997
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:59,069
so I can make sure
that everything's okay?"

998
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:00,987
I was like, "No.

999
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,823
I was like, "Dear Jesus...

1000
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,161
please blur this man's eyes...

1001
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:13,667
so he can't read that my name
is Mohammed Mustafa Amer, please."

1002
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,045
And he grabs my driver's license
and he goes, "You know what, son?

1003
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:20,257
I just feel so blessed that you and I
are not severely injured this evening.

1004
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,550
Why don't you take your license
and get out of here?"

1005
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,427
And I was like, "Hamdulillah!"

1006
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:25,929
And I just drove away.

1007
