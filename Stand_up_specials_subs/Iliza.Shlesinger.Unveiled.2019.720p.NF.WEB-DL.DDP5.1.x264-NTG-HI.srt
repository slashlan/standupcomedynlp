00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,771
Thank you.

14
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,399
So this year was a really important year
for me

15
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,817
because I got...

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,861
- [gruff vocalization]
- [audience cheers]

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,738
Thank you.

18
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,032
I appreciate that.

19
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,867
I appreciate that reciprocity.

20
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,370
I said something positive,
you gave me positivity back.

21
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,247
I was like, "I got married,"

22
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,291
and you were like,
"That's great. How old is she?"

23
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,013
- But like, you went...
- [audience laughs]

24
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,251
...for it.

25
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,754
I think sometimes as women

26
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,466
we're afraid to share good personal news
with people.

27
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:33,051
[women whoo]

28
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,471
Because we're afraid
that other women won't be happy for us.

29
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,388
What a scathing note

30
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,474
- to start a special out on.
- [laughing]

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,936
But all too often you say
something good like, "I got married,"

32
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,188
and what I'll get back is like...
[nasally] "Amazing."

33
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,731
- [Iliza laughs]
- [audience laughs]

34
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,067
I am here running on a platform

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,403
to eradicate the usage of the word...
[nasally] "amazing"...

36
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,696
[laughter]

37
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,365
...from our female vocabularies

38
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,576
because I know what "amazing" means. Okay?

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,996
Girls, when you say "amazing,"
I know you don't mean amazing.

40
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,083
Okay, so save it for your boyfriends.
[gruff] They are not paying attention.

41
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,793
[audience laughs]

42
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,045
I know what amazing means.

43
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,422
When a woman says "amazing,"
what she actually means is,

44
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,986
"This isn't about me
and I don't care and I'm a little insecure

45
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,302
but I wanna make sure
I'm being a good feminist

46
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,986
and saying 'amazing' back
when in actuality it's boring." Amazing.

47
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,391
- That's what that means.
- [cheering, clapping]

48
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,516
[nasally] Amazing.

49
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:26,521
We've become like robots just like,
"Amazing, amazing, amaz...

50
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:28,731
- [nasally] Amazing. It's amazing."
- [laughing]

51
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,608
Because in the wake of Me Too
and Time's Up,

52
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,278
all of these important,
very necessary movements,

53
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,489
what's come out of it
is women policing other women

54
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:41,119
and we walk around terrified
as women of being called bad feminists

55
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,788
by quite frankly other bad feminists.

56
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,708
So we all walk around
on this heightened alert like,

57
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,831
"She's amazing. I didn't say anything.
Don't get mad at me. I love all women.

58
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,964
No woman's ever made a mistake.
White jeans are always a great choice.

59
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,008
- Slay, queen." Terrified.
- [laughter]

60
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,091
Terrified.

61
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,012
[cheering, clapping]

62
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,642
That if we give an actual opinion,
we're going to get crucified.

63
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:06,477
That if you say any criticism,

64
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,401
some blogger in the back of the room
is like...

65
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,191
[muppet-like] "Female comic
shamed my choices by existing.

66
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,484
She hurt my fee-fees."
[indistinct groaning]

67
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,445
- That's what happens.
- [audience laughs]

68
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,032
So we all walk around and all we're doing

69
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,159
is blaming other women
for our own insecurities

70
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,244
and all of a sudden
everyone's shaming everyone

71
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,624
by sharing an opinion that you fought
so valiantly to get to exercise.

72
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,667
"You're shaming her. You're shaming her."

73
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,128
[yelling]
"I'm not. She fucked up my coffee order.

74
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,672
[roaring laughter]

75
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,508
No personal agenda.
I asked her to make it again."

76
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,594
This is why China is beating us.

77
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,179
- [laughing]
- [chuckles] Okay?

78
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,388
I'm a real feminist.

79
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,600
I judge you on the asshole
that you are, we go from there.

80
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,393
That's what it should be. Okay?

81
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,518
[whoos]

82
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,396
That's what it should be.

83
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,106
[clapping, whistling]

84
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,651
You liking another woman
should not be mandated.

85
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,611
That's not feminism,
that's communism.

86
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:57,570
- Okay?
- [cheers]

87
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,407
This idea that just because she showed up
I'm supposed to have this abundant love,

88
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,159
I can promise you this as a feminist.

89
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,536
I'm excited you showed up.
I'm excited you're capable.

90
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,500
I do not hate you
because you're younger than me

91
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,018
or prettier than me or as successful.

92
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,500
However, you showed up and so did I

93
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,623
so let's get it started
'cause life's a competition.

94
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,046
- [uproarious cheers]
- Like, let's do it that way. Okay?

95
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,131
[clapping]

96
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,633
[woman whoos]

97
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,385
And I know other women feel the same way,

98
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,508
not just because you're laughing
at what I'm saying,

99
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:26,015
but if you look at the language that women
consistently use to uphold one another,

100
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,227
the language is aggressive.
'Cause women are aggressive,

101
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,630
we're just not allowed to show it

102
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,146
because "likability and wrinkles."

103
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,856
- [laughing]
- So we keep everything...

104
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,149
But we're aggressive,

105
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,028
look at the words we use
on our "slay all day" tote bags

106
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,407
and our "feminists with to-do lists"
neckerchiefs.

107
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,242
- Look at the words. [chuckles]
- [laughter]

108
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,202
[nasally] "You're killing it."

109
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,912
[gruff] "I'm gonna kill you."

110
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,164
[roaring laughter]

111
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,793
"She's slaying it."

112
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,878
[gruff] "I'll slay you
in the fucking streets."

113
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,130
[audience laughs]

114
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,881
"Murdering it." "Wrecking it."

115
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,235
[demonic] "Shutting it down
in the name of the dark lord!"

116
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,459
- Like everything.
- [cheering]

117
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,223
It's just on fire. It's exhausting.

118
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,602
I don't have, at 36, the full energy
every time I see a woman to be like...

119
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,730
[yelling] "Kill it, queen! Mama.

120
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,813
- Amazing!"
- [laughing]

121
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:19,152
'Cause I'm so tired from doing
all the other shit society told me to do.

122
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:22,339
So if I see you, you're not going
to get the full welcome bouquet,

123
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,239
but it's not personal.

124
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,950
The most you're going to get
out of me is just... [gasps, grunts]

125
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,910
[roaring laughter]

126
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,911
[croaks]

127
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,874
So I got married and I married a chef,

128
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,001
another thing that
I was reticent to tell people

129
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:39,172
because of our country's
preconceived notions about chefs

130
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,966
and everybody has an opinion on food.

131
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,844
Everyone you know, you say,
"I married a chef." They're like...

132
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:48,056
[muppet-like] "I am a chef, sort of.
I film myself, I make it.

133
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,308
- I put my hand in the water!
- [laughing]

134
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:53,061
I'm in to cooking.
I have a food blog, I'm a foodie."

135
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,395
Nope, you're just huge.

136
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,707
- It's not... you're not a foodie.
- [uproarious laughter]

137
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,107
It's not the same.

138
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,817
"I love food."

139
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,779
I'm like, "Me too when I'm drunk
at 3:00 a.m. and there's a taco truck,

140
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,631
'I'm a foodie, '
but it's not the same thing."

141
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,407
- [laughing]
- "No, I have a blog.

142
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,994
I write mean comments in a Yelp page.
I'm hoping to get a series picked up

143
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,621
- based off of it.
- [laughter]

144
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,499
I love... I take pictures of my spaghetti
with a flash

145
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,167
so it looks like a snuff film."

146
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,460
[audience laughs]

147
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,547
Pro tip: don't take a picture
of your food. Period.

148
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,300
But don't take a picture
of your food with a flash.

149
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,427
It makes the food look like a hostage.

150
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,720
[laughing]

151
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,138
The food always looks scared.

152
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,076
Like, take a picture of spaghetti
with a flash, the spaghetti looks like,

153
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
it's like, "Please unchain me,
I won't tell anyone.

154
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,187
- [laughter]
- [hoarse] I promise to be loyal."

155
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,732
Everyone's involved with food now.

156
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,902
I think it's because of the Food Network,
the ubiquity of these cooking shows.

157
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,279
Everyone loves cooking
and the Food Network,

158
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,467
even if you haven't seen the Food Network,
you've seen the Food Network, right?

159
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,636
- Like, we've all seen <i>Chopped, </i>right?
- [affirming yell]

160
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,495
- [whoos]
- Yeah.

161
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,554
Inside your wicker basket,
you'll find a severed head and a grape,

162
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,749
make a frittata. Yes.

163
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,835
- [audience laughs]
- [woman whoos]

164
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,711
And everyone's a celebrity chef now.

165
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,339
Everyone's like a "celebrity chef."
You can't just be a chef.

166
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,383
When I was little, I don't remember
any boy saying they wanted to be chefs.

167
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,626
There were no celebrity chefs.

168
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,513
There were like a couple of them.
When your parents were kids,

169
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,076
there were like three fat French guys

170
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
- and Julia Child and like that was it.
- [laughing]

171
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,479
You weren't a chef, you were a cook
and you were a cook on accident.

172
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,883
You were a cook 'cause dudes
were coming home from Vietnam,

173
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,608
we didn't know what PTSD was yet,

174
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,052
they're like, "Bob's acting weird.

175
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,237
- Stick him in the back."
- [audience laughs]

176
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,367
[continued laughing]

177
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,245
[cackling]

178
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,498
"Female comic makes
scathing social commentary

179
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,042
- about our nation's treatment of veterans.
- [laughter]

180
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,752
Accurate but hurtful."

181
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,465
[cheering]

182
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,805
And because of how many food shows
there are out there,

183
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,242
the Food Network knows
what kind of chefs you like to watch,

184
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,977
so they cast the same archetypes
of chefs, right?

185
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,313
So there's always like a "bad boy" chef

186
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,191
and I didn't want people to think
I was married to that.

187
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,274
[laughing]

188
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,279
Like just a sack of rage,
fully tattooed piece of shit.

189
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,449
[gruff] "This is a devil's tooth,
here's your crepe, suck my dick, Karen!

190
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:14,827
- [audience laughs]
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

191
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,662
These are gauges in my ears,

192
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,066
they also measure out an ounce
of responsibly-sourced tuna,

193
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,791
eat my butt, Susan!

194
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,186
- [roaring laughter]
- Just tough.

195
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,670
[yelling] Yeah, wallet chain.

196
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,674
I keep a knife in my truck
to do a fine chop on parsley,

197
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,177
- lick it. Just tough."
- [audience laughs]

198
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,889
There's always a bad boy chef
and there's always a lesbian chef.

199
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,182
[whoos]

200
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,267
There's always a lesbian chef

201
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:42,313
that takes cooking, like,
a little too seriously...

202
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,636
- [laughter]
- ...for this to be

203
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,150
an enjoyable viewing experience.
They're always posted up,

204
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,194
feet hip-width apart, like...
[husky] "Yes, chef!"

205
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,070
You're like, "Okay.

206
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,155
[laughing]

207
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,782
[Iliza chuckles]

208
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,993
- Can you just stand down?
- [roaring laughter]

209
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,747
Thank you for your dinner service,
but just relax."

210
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,040
[howling laughter]

211
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,000
"I make vegan wedding cakes."

212
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,294
- "You need to chill out."
- [audience laughs]

213
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,213
This is so aggressive, right?

214
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,297
They're always tough.

215
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,509
She always got a faux hawk and a bandanna.

216
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:14,095
- [laughter]
- And food-related tattoos.

217
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,806
[gruff] Like salt, pepper, sugar.
Like, yeah.

218
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:17,890
[roaring laughter]

219
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,813
Right? They're always like meaty.

220
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,065
Always a...
Always a little mean-looking, right,

221
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,109
but she always got
a dainty name, like "Charity"

222
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,279
'cause her parents weren't counting
on having a pit bull for a daughter.

223
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:32,655
[uproarious laughter]

224
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,576
[whooing, clapping]

225
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:42,038
[woman whoos]

226
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,060
"Chef Charity, what would you do
if you won today's episode?"

227
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:48,170
"I would take that money
so me and my girlfriend, Steph..."

228
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,922
[laughter]

229
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,675
- It's always Steph.
- [audience laughs]

230
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,422
There's no tough lesbians
out there like, "Hey there.

231
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,014
- [nasally] Stephanie."
- [audience laughs]

232
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,726
"Me and my girlfriend,
Steph, take that money,

233
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,770
move upstate, open up our own bakery
and bake everything from snatch."

234
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,314
- And then...
- [roaring laughter]

235
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,649
- Okay. Okay.
- [cheering]

236
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,028
There you are. There you are.

237
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,739
[continued cheering]

238
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,075
Not such a proper Southern crowd, are we?

239
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,410
[whooing]

240
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,997
I always like to see where my audience
has like gerrymandered its ethics

241
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,249
- for the evening's performance.
- [audience laughs]

242
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,712
Most of you laugh, there's always
a couple people in the back, like...

243
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,964
[Southern drawl] "She said snatch
so close to Sunday.

244
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,132
[laughing]

245
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,841
No.

246
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,468
No, ma'am.

247
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,512
[howling laughter]

248
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,727
I am uncomfortable.

249
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,810
[laughter]

250
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,104
It's unholy.

251
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:51,233
We got four churches on every corner,
but I feel uncomfortable."

252
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,944
[uproarious laughter, cheering]

253
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:02,370
"Female comic makes commentary
on social topography of neighborhood,

254
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,955
"can't tell what audience
is cheering for." Okay...

255
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,207
[audience laughs]

256
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,084
So we went on our honeymoon

257
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,836
and my husband really wanted
to go to Italy.

258
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,089
Really wanted to go. I didn't want to go.

259
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,300
- [indistinct grunt]
- [laughing]

260
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,194
I didn't want to go 'cause I'd been.
I wanted to go other places,

261
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,306
but he wanted to go because he's a chef
and Italy is like a food mecca,

262
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,808
so he wanted to make his hajj.

263
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,852
So he wanted to go to Italy
and I said yes, not because I love him

264
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,605
but because you can find alcohol
pretty much anywhere.

265
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,107
[laughter]

266
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,693
So we go and he nerded out.

267
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,405
He made a map,
a real eat-seeking map of the whole...

268
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,823
- [laughing]
- ...country.

269
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:43,160
And we didn't do the tourist stuff.
We went to like the foodie, cheffy places.

270
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,455
We went to the region where they grow
the grapes that the goats eat.

271
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,059
The special goats and they take a dump

272
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,709
and it makes the fertilizer

273
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,336
that makes the mushrooms.
If you eat them, you get detained.

274
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,089
- Like we did a whole thing.
- [roaring laughter]

275
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,924
[whoos]

276
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,759
And on, like, day five,

277
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,220
I was like, "I can't... [gurgles]
I can't do this anymore.

278
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,180
- [laughing]
- [guttural] I can't eat any more.

279
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,640
I want to pick something.

280
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,351
I cannot be carted around anymore
like a prize pig.

281
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,675
- I want to pick...
- [laughter]

282
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,522
I want to participate in this.
I want to pick the restaurant

283
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,482
and I want to order in Italian."

284
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,819
My husband goes, "You want to pick
the restaurant and order in Italian?"

285
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,782
I was like, "Yeah,
I've seen <i>Lady and the Tramp,</i>

286
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,021
- like, I know what's going on."
- [uproarious laughter]

287
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,471
The picking of the restaurant
wasn't that important to me.

288
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,249
It was speaking Italian in a restaurant
was important to me for one simple fact.

289
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,668
I didn't like the idea that as an American

290
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,130
I would walk into some random part
of Italy into a random restaurant

291
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:40,009
and have some random Italian waiter
think that I expected him,

292
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,553
in his own country,
to speak English, okay?

293
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,013
- [cheering]
- Yeah.

294
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,932
[clapping]

295
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,579
Although he probably should,
like that or Spanish or Mandarin,

296
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,646
- like something along those... So...
- [laughter]

297
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,441
But I'm hyperaware
of how we're perceived when we travel.

298
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,361
As an American and I am very,
very proud to be an American,

299
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,197
I know that people are watching us.

300
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,960
Yeah, you can cheer for that. That's fine.

301
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,742
[cheering, clapping]

302
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,910
They have questions.

303
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,036
A lot of them hate us

304
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,205
- 'cause they ain't us and they want...
- [laughter]

305
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,625
...a reason to discount you
and that goes for whoever you are,

306
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,251
whatever you look like from anywhere.

307
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,754
When you travel abroad and you fuck up,

308
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:20,633
people will decide,
"Oh, all of your kind are like that."

309
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,928
And I couldn't stomach that
'cause I am so proud to be an American

310
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:26,448
and I wanted him to think
all the great things about Americans

311
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,992
that we already think about ourselves.

312
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,177
- So I wanted...
- [laughing]

313
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:33,646
...to walk in and have him think
that we're educated and open-minded

314
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,607
and kind and if I'm shitcanned
and embarrassing in public,

315
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,193
I want people to know
I'm Canadian and I'm sorry.

316
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,194
[roaring laughter]

317
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,321
[whooing, clapping]

318
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,409
So I'm all set to speak Italian.

319
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,453
I've got the, like, translator thing.

320
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,621
I'm all ready to go,

321
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,304
he hands me a menu
and it's a steakhouse.

322
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,559
I'm like, "I'm gonna do this.
It'll be flawless Italian.

323
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,583
It'll be so impressive.
Everyone will be impressed.

324
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,671
They're gonna vote me mayor of Italy.
Open it up..."

325
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,424
And I open the menu and all
of their steaks were listed... [gasps]

326
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,884
...in grams.

327
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,346
[laughing]

328
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,729
There's a 500 gram steak.
[screaming] What the fuck is a gram?

329
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,857
[uproarious laughter]

330
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,068
I was so busy

331
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:26,407
focusing on coming off looking amazing
and the conjugation and the pronunciation,

332
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,117
I forgot the rest of the world

333
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,703
- uses metric to measure.
- [laughter]

334
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,539
The rest of the world uses fucking logic.

335
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,207
[audience laughs]

336
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,043
Tens, one hundreds. Yes!

337
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,670
[cheering]

338
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,339
[whoos]

339
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,592
We here in the United States,

340
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,678
we like to measure based...
[unearthly]...on a dream.

341
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,761
[laughter]

342
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,808
And I'm staring at this 500 gram steak

343
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,328
and the waiter's looking at me,
my new husband's looking at me

344
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,605
and I'm trying to do
the conversion math in my head

345
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,857
where my only frame of reference was like,

346
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,443
"Okay. Well, a gram of cocaine
is like that much."

347
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,403
- [uproarious laughter]
- [mouths words]

348
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,074
[screaming laughter]

349
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,286
[whooing]

350
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,413
[cackling]

351
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,510
Okay, you know what? We're just gonna do
an eight ball of steak.

352
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,845
[laughing]

353
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,221
For the table.

354
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,766
- Yeah.
- [cheering]

355
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,850
Thank you.

356
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,227
[whooing]

357
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,271
[Italian accent] <i>Grazie mille.</i>

358
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,439
[audience laughs]

359
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,692
I love it, Nashville turned up
for that cocaine joke.

360
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,777
[roaring laughter]

361
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,237
Oh, yeah. I heard a lot of guys laughing.

362
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,365
[gruff]
"Don't let the Vineyard Vines fool you,

363
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,741
I fucking love rails!

364
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,076
[audience laughs]

365
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,747
I may have little whales
embroidered on my shorts

366
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,041
- but I like to fuck and party.
- [howling laughter]

367
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,336
Yeah. You can seersucker my dick."

368
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,047
- [cheering]
- Love the South.

369
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,050
[whooing]

370
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,369
So I got married about a year ago.

371
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,347
I've had about a year to think on it,
ruminate on it, marinate on it,

372
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,600
and I think what's fascinating
about getting married is

373
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,645
it's one of the few acts
you can go through in this lifetime

374
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,899
where once you do it once
you come out the other end an expert.

375
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,067
[laughter]

376
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,194
Totally omniscient, you know everything.

377
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,780
You do it once,
you come out the other end,

378
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,865
you know everything about weddings,
every detail.

379
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,660
The problem is nobody wants
your shitty wedding advice.

380
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,911
[laughter]

381
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,996
Like no one.

382
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,541
Other women will ask you advice
as a way of ingratiating themselves

383
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,084
or perhaps bonding with you.

384
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,287
We as women are often taught

385
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,055
if we act like we don't know
what's going on

386
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,368
and we need help
other people will find us more palatable.

387
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,023
So you say to other women, like...
[muppet-like] "You got married?

388
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,052
I'm getting married.
I don't know what's going on.

389
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,930
What color is white?
Is my foot in a bear trap? Help me!"

390
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,055
[audience laughs]

391
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,685
And the other woman
thinking she's helping you

392
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,808
and doing something right,

393
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,896
she's like, "Oh, okay.
You want advice, great.

394
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,691
Okay, so for my wedding,
what I found helpful..."

395
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,652
But the whole time she's talking,
all you're sitting there thinking is,

396
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,256
"Oh, my God, that is a tacky-ass wedding,
you're a dumb hooker."

397
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,760
- [howling laughter]
- The whole time.

398
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,533
- [cheering]
- Yeah.

399
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,829
Because every girl thinks
every other girl kind of fucked it up

400
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,664
- and you'll do better.
- [laughter]

401
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:23,042
You won't, and on that note,

402
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:27,212
I've come humbly offering
some wedding advice to you, Nashville.

403
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:31,091
[uproarious cheering, clapping]

404
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,594
One thing you must know,

405
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:37,056
the wedding industry is not designed
to bring two loving souls together

406
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,724
under the State and/or God,

407
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,018
it is designed to extract
your money from your wallet,

408
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,605
pit you against other women
and make you feel like garbage fire.

409
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,316
- That's what it's there for. Okay?
- [whooing]

410
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,946
There's a litany of requirements,
social, cultural, traditional.

411
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,283
All these things, everything's got
a price tag, everything takes up time

412
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,595
and I'll tell you what,
I paid for my wedding personally.

413
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,537
So you can best believe
I took a red Sharpie

414
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,039
and went down that list of bullshit

415
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,002
and if it didn't involve me
taking off my shoes,

416
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,841
drinking tequila
or listening to Garth Brooks,

417
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,211
we did not fucking do it.

418
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,379
- [blows into mic]
- [cheering]

419
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,589
Yes.

420
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,053
[continued cheering]

421
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,890
That's right, Nashville.

422
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,476
The theme of my wedding was feminism.

423
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,311
No one had a good time.

424
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,562
[whooing]

425
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,525
But there's all these things,
all these requirements,

426
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,008
all these traditions, these things,

427
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,363
and I took a comedian's
microscopic lens to each thing

428
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,326
and was like,
"Is it weird? We're not doing it."

429
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,534
So the first thing I refused to do,

430
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,537
I would not wear a garter, okay?

431
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,704
[uproarious cheers]

432
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,748
Okay. Okay.

433
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,751
Some of you cheered,

434
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,796
some of you were like,
"I'm still wearing mine. What's up?

435
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,399
- [audience laughs]
- What the fuck is up, Hollywood?"

436
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,842
[laughter]

437
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,219
I'm glad that not everyone
cheered for that

438
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,429
because it sets up
my next point perfectly.

439
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,347
Okay?

440
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,150
It's important to me
that me and my audience

441
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,768
be on the same mental page
for the rest of the set.

442
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,062
Okay, right now in 2019,

443
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,731
more than it was
five minutes ago, right now,

444
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,193
it's the best time it's ever been
to be a woman in most states.

445
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,653
- It's the best time.
- [laughing]

446
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,071
I said it, I meant it.

447
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,407
- The best time. Okay?
- [cheering]

448
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,492
[clapping, whooing]

449
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,161
But overall,

450
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,123
we are the most heard, the loudest
in our message, the most unified.

451
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:30,085
However, with this newfound sense
of feminism, I have noticed

452
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,548
that there's this weird splinter-faction
of feminists, of women who get angry

453
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:38,468
at other women when they deign
to disagree with an opinion

454
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,352
and then it's not enough
to agree to disagree.

455
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,597
They want you fucking dead.

456
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,765
- [laughing]
- I am talking drawn and quartered

457
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,559
in a Twitter town square.

458
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,269
[laughter]

459
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,354
Because you hurt their feelings.

460
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,898
So I get up here... As a joke.

461
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:51,899
No harm intended.

462
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,025
It's a funny time,

463
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,748
and I get up here and I'm like,
"Don't wear a garter, it's trashy,"

464
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,817
and I get that same blogger
in the back of the room,

465
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,574
like, "Female comic shamed
my wedding-day choices

466
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,285
and I don't have the social wherewithal
to confront her in person

467
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,088
so I'm just going to hurl
these insult turds

468
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,456
- from behind a faceless avatar."
- [audience laughs]

469
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,459
- [cheering]
- So...

470
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,628
So,

471
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:16,381
since we're all so hurt
and gutless all the time,

472
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,634
I'm going to stick to my initial notion.

473
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,719
You look like a saloon hooker.

474
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,845
[whooing]

475
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,137
Okay?

476
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,351
- Go get married at a Six Flags.
- [audience laughs]

477
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,649
Girls, there's got to be a middle ground
where someone disagrees with you

478
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,609
and you get the fuck over it.

479
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,861
- Okay? You don't have to hate her.
- [cheering]

480
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,656
Don't have to hold on to it.

481
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,199
[continued cheering]

482
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,495
One woman's affirmation
of her life choices

483
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,288
is not the negation of your existence.

484
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,374
- Be better than that. Okay?
- [whooing]

485
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,457
Yeah.

486
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,962
We can't walk around

487
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,463
calling ourselves queens.

488
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:59,299
"I'm a queen. She doesn't like my top!"
[screeches]

489
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,468
- [laughter]
- Who cares? Move the fuck on.

490
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,303
And you know who does this better? Men.

491
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,555
They agree to disagree
all the time and they're fine.

492
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,847
You see it all the time.

493
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,977
Guy's like, "He's my best friend.
I don't like his politics and he's stupid.

494
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,937
- He's a son of a bitch, but...
- [laughing]

495
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,703
I love him. We didn't get along at first.

496
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,483
We went out back.
We had a drink. We fought.

497
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,527
We had a little bit of sex
and we were good to go.

498
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,890
- [roaring laughs]
- Good to go!"

499
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,115
[cheering]

500
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,701
[whistling]

501
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,287
That's what we must do, girls.
Just move on.

502
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,349
You want to wear a garter, wear it.
I'm not going to be at your wedding,

503
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,373
you wear it with pride.

504
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,084
- I want to see...
- [laughing]

505
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,212
I want to see every one
of your wedding pictures,

506
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,299
you, garter on, dress hiked up,
holding a shotgun, like...

507
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,218
[uproarious laughter, cheering]

508
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:49,850
- $5,000 reward, sepia tone. Like that's...
- [audience laughs]

509
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,184
Remember sepia tone?

510
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,895
What's a garter?

511
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,397
Some of you might be wondering.

512
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,940
[laughter]

513
00:21:57,024 --> 00:22:00,235
Perhaps you're from the future
where they've eradicated this practice.

514
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,319
[laughing]

515
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,655
A garter is

516
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,158
a Barbie doll scrunchie...

517
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,452
[audience laughs]

518
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,247
...forged of the finest polyester lace.

519
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,790
[laughing]

520
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,460
Comes in one size.

521
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,543
[quick blow into mic]

522
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,004
[laughing]

523
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,922
Shame.

524
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,632
[audience laughs]

525
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:26,386
And you, on your wedding day,

526
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,222
among the one million things
you're in charge of, girls,

527
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,976
are also tasked with taking
this fucking NuvaRing...

528
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,269
[roaring laughter]

529
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,192
...and hoisting it up your leg.

530
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,611
God forbid on the wedding day

531
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,447
we give women a break
with the body-image issues.

532
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,530
[laughter, whoos]

533
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:49,117
And be like,
"Oh, what? That goose-choker?

534
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,078
[audience laughs]

535
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,623
That lap-band for a chinchilla?
Yeah, you could just...

536
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,333
- [laughing]
- [Iliza chuckles]

537
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,836
You can just wear that
at the ankle, that's fine.

538
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,506
You can just wear that
where everything tapers."

539
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,717
[hoarse] "No! You got to get it up.
Get it up here."

540
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,053
To this thick-ass traffic jam.

541
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,805
[audience laughs]

00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,559
[cheering, clapping]

544
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,357
Of just ice-cold fat and skin and dinner,

545
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,900
- just thick.
- [laughter]

546
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,237
I live in L.A. They're like, "You can
freeze it off if you don't like it."

547
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm like,
"I've done North Dakota winters.

548
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,199
- It did not go anywhere."
- [audience laughs]

549
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,163
"Female comic shames her own thigh
and in doing so makes millions of women

550
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,665
question their own thighs.

551
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,166
Why can't you love your thighs?"

552
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,086
- Because I am a white woman, okay?
- [laughing]

553
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,796
- We don't know.
- [cheers]

554
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,625
We haven't figured that out.

555
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,677
Women of color for a couple years now
have been like, "This is a thigh."

556
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,114
And society's been like,
"That is a thigh. We celebrate it."

557
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,764
White women somehow,

558
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:55,016
we're still like,
"Uh-uh, I'm gonna shave it down.

559
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,620
- I'm gonna make it small.

Be small.

562
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,570
I'm gonna fuse my rib cage to my shin.

563
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,373
- Be cage and shin. Snip, snip.
- [laughing]

564
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,781
You won't even see it.

565
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,492
I'm the crab woman.
You won't even know it.

[continued laughing]

No thighs, can't see them. Can't be big.

568
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,182
No thighs. If I walk,
I'm gonna put my thighs in the background,

569
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:20,959
put my tits in the foreground
and walk around like this.

From here to here,

573
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,597
I am a woman, but from here to here
I want to be a ten-year-old Japanese boy.

574
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,556

[cheering]

And it never looks nice.

580
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,867
Your leg has to be the length
of your body...

581
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,619
[inhales]...for it to look nice.

582
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,537
You look down,
you finally get it up there,

583
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,957
you're like, "It looks like I put
a mini tennis skirt on a Christmas ham.

[audience laughs]

It hurts."

00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:09,882
And it's tight.

587
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,343
Of course, it's tight.

588
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,304
It's a garter.
It's meant to hold up clothing.

589
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:17,599
And right now all it's holding up
is that blood flow.

590
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,142
[laughter]

591
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,199
Blood, like, trying to get to the artery.

592
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:23,228
- You're like... [indistinct grunting]
- [laughing]

593
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,397
Your skin is just...

594

- [blows twice into mic]

...MoonPieing out on either side.

[laughing]

597
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:33,865
You're staring down at your corpulent leg

- as it pulsates.
- [laughter]

599

With stagnant blood.

600
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,853
It's turning a light shade of blue.

601
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,249
You're like,
"I'm the night queen. I don't know.

- [laughing]
- What is this?"

603
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:48,171
You don't have time to ponder
the deadening of your leg.

604
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,425
You don't have time.
You got to get yourself over

605
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,267
to the dance floor, sweet tits.
That's right.

606
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,678
[breathless] You gotta get yourself
over to the dance floor

607
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:58,598
where you and your new husband
are going to perform a weird,

608
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,727
- sexual garter-removal dance...
- [cheering]

609
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,814
[yelling, guttural]
...in front of your family!

- [continued cheering]
- [Iliza screams]

611
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,572
- Your mother is there!
- [laughter]

612
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,866
You're sitting there spread-eagle,
she's like, "I'll get it on tape,

613
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,786
I'll be there for the conception.
This is excellent."

614
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,205
Your father is there
and he loves you, girls,

615
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:25,169
but he is tapped out. He's like...
[gruff] "Yeah, fuck her, I don't know.

616
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,294
[uproarious laughter]

617
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,551
He's a good guy and this is good shrimp.

618
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,927
[laughing]

619
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,638
It's good shrimp.
It's a cash bar, but they're trying."

620
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,265
[laughter]

621
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,311
So you got to get over there
for that dance.

622
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:45,604
So you go to the dance floor,

623
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,190
- you drag your now purple...
- [laughing]

624
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,442
...stump

625
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,112
over to... [gasps]

626
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,781
- ...a single chair.
- [laughter]

627
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,492
- [whoos]
- A single chair

628
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,247
that has been ominously placed
in the center of the dance floor.

629
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,457
[audience laughs]

630
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,168
[elderly]
You are meant to sit in this chair...

631
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,294
[laughter]

632
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,879
...my child.

633
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,505
[uproarious laughter]

634
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,883
- Sit down.
- [cheering, clapping]

635
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,679
And you're like, "Sit, okay. I wasn't
planning on enjoying myself, but okay."

636
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:21,097
[audience laughs]

637
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,351
Sit in the chair? Well,
that's easier said than done, isn't it?

638
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,978
'Cause you're a bride like me
or a bride that chose a dress

639
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,980
that was form over function.

640
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,982
- [laughter]
- Your dress is tight.

641
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,109
You're a bride like me
that perhaps chose a dress

642
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,945
that was a size,
maybe half a size too small, right?

643
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,439
'Cause you told yourself
you were gonna lose the weight

644
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,690
for the wedding,
but you didn't lose the weight, did ya?

645
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,160
- [laughing]
- No.

646
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,829
No, in fact,
you gained two pounds just trying.

647
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,073
- [continued laughing]
- Yeah.

648
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,710
So that dress is tight and you are trying
to make yourself thin and compact

649
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,003
in the moment, right?

650
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,297
You got all your carry-on luggage up here.

651
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,882
[roaring laughter]

652
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,052
Trying to extend the torso,
tuck in the tailbone,

653
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,554
- protecting the spine, moving with breath.
- [laughing]

654
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,307
All the way down, slowly, slowly.

655
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,767
You're like that goat in the cage

656
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,977
in that first <i>Jurassic Park </i>like...
[bleats]

657
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,105
[laughing, whooing]

658
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,776
How does she work that noise
into every special?

659
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,735
[audience laughs]

660
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,028
- [bleats]
- [cheering]

661
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,573
[clapping]

662
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,994
Slowly lowering yourself down,
praying to God that you don't experience

663
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:28,873
the one female-specific sartorial mishap
there's no coming back from.

664
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,894
When you're a woman, there's a lot
that can go wrong. You snap a heel.

665
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,718
[mumbles]
You have an accident on your period.

666
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,004
Your bra strap, whatever.

667
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:39,008
[breathless] But none is more embarrassing
than the horror

668
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,680
of going to sit down
and having the back of your dress

669
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,848
burst open.

670
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,641
- [booming vocalizations]
- [laughing]

671
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,564
'Cause it couldn't contain your lady meat.

672
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,982
- [blows into mic]
- [cheering]

673
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,524
[blows into mic]

674
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,152
[guttural scream]

675
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,113
[Hulk-like]
You won't like me when I'm married.

676
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,157
- [whooing]
- [blowing in mic]

677
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,576
[laughing]

678
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,495
I don't think the Hulk threw his shit,
but...

679
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,998
- [laughter]
- [nasally]...this Hulk does.

680
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,252
So you finally sit down, right?
You go down to the hem of your skirt,

681
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,921
it's time to show off
that $2.45 investment, right?

682
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,381
You gotta show off that garter.

683
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,717
You go to lift up the hem
and that's when you realize

684
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,510
you only put on fake tanner to the knee.

685
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,387
[audience laughs]

686
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,056
I'll be brave. [inhales]

687
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,768
- Blinded... No!
- [laughing]

688
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,480
So you put your little white-orange
Dreamsicle leg out there.

689
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,563
[laughter]

690
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:35,981
Right?

691
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,942
And you sit there and you wait

692
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:42,280
and I believe what is to come next
is ostensibly your first real test

693
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,656
as a married couple.

694
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,326
But, of course,
the onus is on the woman to pass this test

695
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:51,831
because it's on you, girls, to sit there
and remain facially-excited...

696
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,100
- [Iliza chuckles]
- [laughing]

697
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:56,044
...and turned on
at your new choice in mate,

698
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:01,299
as your new husband emerges
from the smoke of the DJ lights.

699
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,258
[mic thuds]

700
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,094
[uproarious laughter, cheering]

701
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,018
[whooing]

702
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,686
[clapping]

703
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,707
And you're just sitting there like...
[high-pitched] "That's my baby.

704
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:19,776
- [laughing]
- That's who I might have a family with."

705
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,237
His tuxedo jacket is off,
so you as the bride

706
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,240
are treated to this sweat map
of South America.

707
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,658
[audience laughs]

708
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,912
And you have to sit there

709
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:34,749
ladylike but also excited,
but also demure, but also horny.

710
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,334
- [laughter]
- And sit there

711
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,128
while your new husband
goes under your dress...

712
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,257
This is the most expensive dress
you're probably ever going to wear.

713
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,384
...and he's rooting around under it.

714
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,635
[roaring laughter]

715
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,179
Like a ghost schnauzer.

716
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,139
[audience laughs]

717
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,768
- You're like, "That's my husband."
- [laughter]

718
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,938
He now must remove the garter

719
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:01,609
but according to weird wedding tradition
he's not allowed to use his hands.

720
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,486
- What must he use, Nashville?
- [all] Teeth!

721
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,780
- [indistinct gurgling]
- [roaring laughter]

722
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,574
[woman whoos]

723
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:12,495
So he gets under there,
slides his five-o'clock shadow...

724
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,747
[audience laughs]

725
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,751
...up your five-o'clock shadow.

726
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,963
[laughing, clapping]

727
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,174
[whooing]

728
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:31,055
The viscous exchange of Drakkar Noir
with Bath & Body Works Plumeria.

729
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,932
[laughter]

730
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,519
Gets up here around this side hustle.

731
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,104
[continued laughter]

732
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:43,860
Clamps down on that garter
with, let's hope, wolf-like precision.

733
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,570
[audience laughs]

734
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,118
Slides it down
your sweaty fucking ham hock...

735
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,620
[roaring laughter]

736
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,703
[clapping]

737
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,457
...to the ground

738
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,626
and then he eats it.

739
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,309
- [laughing]
- I don't know what happens.

740
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,254
I've never watched the full YouTube video.

741
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:05,256
- [cheering]
- Okay.

742
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,386
- So, no garter. [chuckles]
- [laughter]

743
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,099
And I did not want to wear a veil

744
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,893
over my face.

745
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
It's okay.

746
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,730
Piercing deafening silence.

747
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,565
[audience laughs]

748
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,485
- One sad "whoo" in the back, it's fine.
- [laughter]

749
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,154
One girl's like,
"Whoo, I'm still gonna do it."

750
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,281
[audience laughs]

751
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,699
[mouths words]

752
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,870
That's fine.
You'll get on board eventually.

753
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,163
[laughing]

754
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,542
I don't like the idea that as a...
[breathes into mic]

755
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,419
[laughter]

756
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,463
What I want...

757
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:51,511
- [intermittently blowing into mic]
- [laughing]

758
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,846
[cheering]

759
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,684
[whooing]

760
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,688
I don't like the notion that because
I'm a woman and it's tradition,

761
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,232
my vision of a current situation...
[huffs]

762
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,875
...let alone an important one...
[huffs]

763
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,193
[laughter]

764
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,070
...should ever be obfuscated

765
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,572
in the name of tradition,
expectation or fashion.

766
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,157
- Okay, I can't see.
- [whooing]

767
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:15,451
- [huffing into mic]
- [cheering]

768
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,453
This is an important day

769
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,137
and I'm fucking over here
like John Cena.

770
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,582
- "You Can't See Me." What is this?
- [roaring laughter]

771
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,252
Watching the whole thing through gauze?

772
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,587
- [laughing]
- I planned... [huffs]

773
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:30,466
I planned this part of the wedding.
I planned the whole wedding, okay?

774
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,470
If you're a girl, you had a lot to do
with it and you don't get to see it.

775
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,929
Homeboy did nothing.

776
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,390
[audience laughs, cheers]

777
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,435
And because he's a boy,
he gets an unencumbered 360-view

778
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,728
of the entire service.

779
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,981
I'm sitting here in a bridal hurt locker.
[huffing]

780
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,566
[laughing]

781
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,486
The girl did everything.

782
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,655
[dowdy voice]
"Female comic assumes gender-roles."

783
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,659
Fuck, yeah. Only women have a bandwidth
for this kind of bullshit.

784
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:57,577
[clapping]

785
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,120
She did everything.

786
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,205
[cheering]

787
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,792
[breathing heavily into mic]

788
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:08,355
You're the one that for the past year
has been clawing at your mother

789
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:11,174
like, "It's buttercream,
not French vanilla, there's a difference!"

790
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,967
- You're the one doing it.
- [laughing]

791
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,803
Put the veil over the boy,
he doesn't care.

792
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,014
[roaring laughter]

793
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:19,807
[whoos]

794
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,392
He doesn't care.

795
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,853
He doesn't care about the details.
He loves you.

796
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,190
Okay, he bought the ring.
He asked you to spend his life with him.

797
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,442
It's enough, put the veil over the cage

798
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:30,777
like a blanket over a parrot.

799
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,112
- [parrot mimic] Night-night.
- [audience laughs]

800
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,865
Polly go night-night.

801
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,701
And then when it comes
for the important part,

802
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,912
like, "Do you take this woman?"
[mimic] "Polly does."

803
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,039
- Put it back down. It's fine.
- [laughing]

804
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,124
- He doesn't care.
- [cheering]

805
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,418
[clapping, whooing]

806
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,379
Put a game on in there like, "Bye-bye."

807
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,007
He doesn't care.
No man cares. He loves you.

808
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,372
He thinks you're beautiful,
wants to marry you. That's it.

809
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,929
No man cares.
You're sitting there shrouded in mystery.

810
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,847
No man's ever going
to be standing there like,

811
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,826
"I know you can't see this,
but I'll tell you what. You were right,

812
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,103
- peonies were an excellent filler flower."
- [laughing]

813
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,874
And you're sitting there like...
[monstrous] "Describe it to me.

814
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,276
- [audience laughs]
- [heavy breathing into mic]

815
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,659
- I wish to know.
- [laughter]

816
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,162
[heavy breathing into mic]
Is my sister here? Does she look jealous?

817
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,748

[breathing continues]

I'm just a humble beekeeper
but one day..."

- [uproarious laughter]
- [final exhale]

821
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,763
Moreover, I think it's creepy.

822
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,392
I think there's something
a little eerie about a bride.

823
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:49,355
If I describe to you a bride
independent of the context of a wedding...

824
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,649
- [whoosh]

[whoos]

833
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:35,943
The pace with which the bride walks
is unnerving, right?

834
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,946
[laughter]

835
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,164
You don't tend to see this gait

836
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,292
independent of a haunting.

837

[audience laughs]

838
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,550
However, the bride moving slowly
is the least creepy of the options

839
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,194
because let me ask you this, Nashville.

840
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,803
What's creepier, okay?

841
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,222
[elderly] A veiled woman

842

walking towards you at this pace?

[laughing]

844
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,147
Or this running at you?

"I don't know.
She jumped into that mirror."

[audience laughs]

853
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:39,799
I don't want to cover my face. Two hours
in hair and makeup just to be like...

854
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,722
[uptight] "All right,
let's get you covered up.

[laughter]

858
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,809
I would have worn the veil over my face

859
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,186
if it was, like,
really important to my mom.

860
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,563
Like if that meant everything to her.

861
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:56,983
I would have done it if she begged me.

862
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:59,568
If she was like,
"I wore the... I covered my shit and...

[laughing]

864
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,631
And your grandma covered her face
and your grandpa...

865
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,735
We're a progressive family.

866
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,658
- ...he covered his face."
- [laughter]

867
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,579
I would have done it,
but I would have had a 'tude about it.

868
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,915
- [laughing]
- I would've put the flap down...

- [grumbling]
- [laughter]

870
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,753
[blows raspberry]
...and be like, "You may kiss the bride."

871
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:20,730
Then he'd lift it, I'd be like,
"You know it's me, motherfucker."

Yeah.

You know it's me, we Ubered here together.

Unpopular opinion,
actually popular opinion,

00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,876
just unpopular
publicly-declared sentiment,

884
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,502
getting married is not that much fun.

885
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,671
- [cheering]
- Yeah.

886
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,328
You're not allowed to say that,

887
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,967
especially if you're a woman,
God forbid, over 30.

[uptight] "Well, you're just lucky
that the Lord sent you someone...

890

...to put up with your shit.

Kissing your dog on the mouth.
Stop taking videos."

[audience laughs, cheers]

893
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,627
There is a world where you can admit
that something is difficult

894
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,236
but also love the byproduct of it.

895
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,698
I love my husband,
but the wedding part is exhausting.

896
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:32,078
It is a physical and mental
and financial just gauntlet.

897
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,747
Even down to the last minute,
the wedding itself.

898
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,791
The whole year is exhausting planning it.

899
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,460
It's fun, you love your mom.
[snarls] But it's a whole thing.

900
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,938
But even just the day of.
Let's talk about the day of.

901
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,107
What happened on the day
of your wedding, girls, right?

902
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:46,509
You had to prepare for it,
like you woke up early.

903
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,469
[peaceful sigh]
Just want to greet the sun.

904

- [laughter]
- [peaceful exhale]

905
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,767
Got up at like 6:00,
like when your dad gets up.

- [hacking vocalization]
- [laughing]

907
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,314
Right? What, did you meditate?
"I just want to be centered."

908
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,734
Right? You worked out
like it matters the day of. It doesn't.

909
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,652
[laughter]

910
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,405
It doesn't. You're not going
to lose any weight at the buzzer.

911
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,466
- It's not going to... [shrieks]
- [audience laughs]

912
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,866
It's never going to happen.

913
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:12,868
What did you do?

914
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,830
You did your little workout
and then you got your makeup done

915
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,708
and your nails and a massage
and a colonic and a hyperbaric chamber

916
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,792
and a hyper...

917
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,420
hyperbolic chamber.

918
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,670
[nasally] Amazing.

919
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:27,383
And you got a situation room
and a silence cone

920
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:30,052
- and a shame corner and a Reiki healing.
- [laughing]

921
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,636
And you went ghost hunting,
you did all this stuff.

922
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
[laughter]

923
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,057
[cackling]

924
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,985
What did your husband do
on your wedding day?

925
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,771
I'll tell you, he woke up like whenever.

926
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,106
[audience laughs]

927
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,718
Went out to eat with his buddies.

928
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,526
"Something tasty,
doesn't matter if I'm fat

929
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,153
'cause I'm a funny guy." Went...

930
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,446
[uproarious laughter]

931
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,197
[whoos]

932
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,782
Who cares if it's bloated?

933
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,743
Right, then he went and got a haircut...

934
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,246
[shrieking]...on the day of the wedding!
Are you kidding me?

935
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,457
- [roaring laughter]
- [continued shrieking]

936
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,421
- What faith you have in this barber.
- [audience laughs]

937
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,632
Went out, had a drink,

938
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,136
went home, jerked off, took a dump.
Who says you can't lose weight?

939
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,280
- Right, fellas?
- [laughing]

940
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,930
Who says you can't lose weight day of?

941
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,891
- Yeah.
- [cheering, clapping]

942
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:20,227
Yeah, probably about 500 grams.

943
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,770
[audience laughs]

944
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:28,611
He took a nap, he woke up
to an alarm labeled "Wedding for you?"

945
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,279
- He barely made it.
- [laughing]

946
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:36,035
The bride, it just doesn't seem
like the bride is having as much fun

947
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:39,038
as everyone else
because she is the one that planned it

948
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,831
and she wants everything to be perfect.

949
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,000
They don't tell you
that when you have a wedding,

950
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,586
you have to plan every moment
because people,

951
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,671
when they get in a group,
it's mob mentality

952
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,132
and they don't think
like they normally would.

953
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,301
Okay, so you would think logically,
like...

954
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:55,596
[uptight] "We said 'I do' in this room
and that room's got food on tables.

955
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,722
[laughing]

956
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,975
Should go from A to B,
shortest distance. No problem."

957
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,353
People are walking into walls like <i>Sims.</i>

958
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,396
[audience laughs]

959
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,902
[continued laughing]

960
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:15,074
You have to shepherd them.
You have to coordinate it.

961
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:17,076
Everything you do
has to have coordination.

962
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,513
People have to be let in.
You have to plan for these moments

963
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,371
that seem organic.

964
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:23,040
I will give you an example.
So, if you're the couple

965
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,085
that wants that moment
where after you say "I do"

966
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,127
and you run out of the religious part

967
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,506
and you get announced
into the room, right?

968
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,842
If you're the couple that wants
to have the DJ to everyone at the party

969
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,263
be like, "For the first time,
Mr. and Mrs. Raccoon."

970
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,973
- [indistinct yelling]
- [laughing]

971
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,433
[gruff yelling]
Have all your babies, yeah!

972
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,768
- If you...
- [laughter]

973
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,981
...want that moment,
you have to plan for it.

974
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:50,234
Meaning, if you want that reveal,
you, after you say "I do,"

975
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,027
have to haul ass out of that room,

976
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,363
go to a fucking broom closet
in a Ramada Inn,

977
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,283
sign away your goats,
his chickens, stamp it, kiss me.

978
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,244
Okay, then you go and you take
your couples pictures

979
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,414
and while you're doing that
they're setting up the party room

980
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,708
and you have to provide
a cocktail hour for your guests.

981
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,831
So that's three parties.
The party they're going to,

982
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,556
this party and then
the one they had before

983
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,088
'cause they're gonna get liquored up

984
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,798
- to listen to "YMCA."
- [laughter]

985
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,718
So they're there
and you have to provide that party,

986
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,082
a party that you're paying for
that you're not invited to.

987
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,139
- [audience laughs]
- [indistinct growl]

988
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,639
[laughing]

989
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:24,893
My wedding planner was like,
"So did you want to do,

990
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,855
like, an oyster bar for your guests?"

991
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,978
I was like, "Do I get to eat
the delicious oysters?"

992
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:33,360
She's like, "No, you're going
to be in the closet taking pictures.

993
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,446
You don't get to partake."

994
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:38,657
I'm like, "Then they can eat corn dogs
and wait in their cars."

995
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,618
- [audience laughs]
- Okay.

996
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,370
Tapped out. Tapped out.

997
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,914
[clapping]

998
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,670
It just felt like the bride
is the last one to have fun.

999
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,380
Even if you have a fun ceremony.

1000
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:54,840
Some couples like that.

1001
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:56,683
Some couples like a quiet,
spiritual ceremony

1002
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,927
with crying and saying I'm sorry.
Some people like...

1003
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,554
[laughing]

1004
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,765
...a fun service,
some people like to dance.

1005
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:07,102
Like white people love to come down
the aisle to that Bruno Mars song, like...

1006
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,562
<i>♪ Hey baby ♪</i>

1007
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,273
<i>- ♪ I'm gonna marry you ♪</i>
- [laughing]

1008
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,191
<i>♪ Marry you... ♪</i>

1009
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,651
The bridesmaids and the groomsmen,

1010
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,944
one who was like a cheer captain
in middle school,

1011
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,657
was like, "We go up, you go down.
Hit it. Go, Cougars. Marry you."

1012
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,618
And then you do it
and it's a whole thing, right?

1013
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,161
So everyone has fun with it.

1014
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:27,581
So the first ones that come down...
Girls, it does not matter who you marry,

1015
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,334
every man has the same group of friends.

1016
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:34,296
- [laughing]
- Every man has the same groom-pod, okay?

1017
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,100
First one to come
walking down that aisle...

1018
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,467
Every man's got
that one friend that's too big, okay?

1019
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,844
- [laughter]
- He's like 6'9".

1020
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,471
His name is Donk.

1021
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,556
- He's just like...
- [roaring laughter]

1022
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:47,810
[clapping]

1023
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,605
...walking on two snapped Achilles
and all head injuries...

1024
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,606
[gruff] "Donk."

1025
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,732
[laughing]

1026
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,819
Everyone's, "Oh, Donk's
doing the choreography, barely."

1027
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,946
- [indistinct grumbling]
- [audience laughs]

1028
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:00,757
- [grumbling continues]
- "Go, Donk!"

1029
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,907
"I am Donk."

1030
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,032
[laughter]

1031
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,326
[grumbling]

1032
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,327
"Put that baby down!"

1033
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,412
"Donk is hungry."

1034
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,539
- [indistinct honking]
- [laughing]

1035
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:11,667
Then the funny friend.

1036
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,670
Every man you date will have
that one friend that's funny.

1037
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:16,463
He never shuts up, his name is Daniel,

1038
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,233
- and he comes down the aisle...
- [laughing]

1039
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,800
[grunting] "Yeah!"

1040
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,969
...and he doesn't see a congregation,

1041
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:22,928
he sees an audience.

1042
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,411
So he's going up to your nana like,

1043
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,140
- "Oh, yeah, Nana. Yeah."
- [laughing]

1044
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,351
Right? And they're loving it.
You're loving it. He's like, "Yeah."

1045
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,155
And the more they laugh,
he's like, "Uh-oh."

1046
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,481
And then he goes off book.
He's like, "Yeah, I do the sprinkler

1047
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,734
- and whatever the hell this is."
- [audience laughs]

1048
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,193
[cheering]

1049
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,571
[whooing]

1050
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,032
And they're loving... and people
are laughing at your wedding,

1051
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,386
bride's not even there yet.
Everyone's having a good time.

1052
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,871
She's in the back,
breathing into a fucking paper bag.

1053
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:50,807
- [laughing]
- And they think Daniel is so funny.

1054
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,333
Then they turn to me,
"Isn't Daniel funny, Iliza?

1055
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,252
You're doing it, bravo.
Move your dick more.

1056
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,004
This is great. Daniel's so fun...

1057
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,505
Iliza, isn't Daniel funny?

1058
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,382
He should've been a comic."
He could've been.

1059
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,466
[gasps] But something happened
senior year at Duke.

1060
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,790
The girl never woke up
but it was wrong place, wrong time.

1061
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,565
He deferred for a year while his parents
put together a defense fund.

1062
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:10,160
He didn't do anything wrong,
but it didn't look very good to apply

1063
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:12,824
to other schools so he deferred
and took community college credits.

1064
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:15,498
His CPA degree wasn't what he wanted,
but he won't graduate on time.

1065
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,833
- But he did graduate.
- [laughing]

1066
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,694
<i>- ♪ Marry you, marry you, marry you ♪</i>
- [screaming laughter]

1067
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:25,073
[cheering, whooing]

1068
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,287
The bridesmaids come down
like, "This is a strapless bra.

1069
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,747
This isn't fun.

1070
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,165
[audience laughs]

1071
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,708
I slept with Daniel."

<i>- ♪ Marry you, marry you ♪</i>
- [laughter]

1073
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,298
Now the groom comes down
and he's in sunglasses.

1074
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,301
[grunts]
"I'm in sunglasses. Isn't this funny?

1075
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,470
I'm indoors, what a juxtaposition.

1076
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,930
[audience laughs]

1077
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,850
I'm in sunglasses, which is an homage
to <i>Risky Business,</i> which is a movie

1078

Men are visual creatures,
I've stated this before.

1200
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:27,811
They're visual creatures, which means,

"I want to set you up with a girl."

And then they move in. Okay?

1216
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,390
He saw you and then
the rest of it was yours, okay?

1217
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:08,393
He saw you at work, at a bar, on an app,

1218
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,228
through your window
for the last six months.

That's fine, she seems warm."

You want a man that is wired that way
for as annoying as it can be.

1227
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,212
Like, "Men are pigs."
You want a man that is visually-wired

1228
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,714
because that's the correct way
to be wired, okay?

1229
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:41,051
"I don't care about her looks."
Yeah, 'cause she's hot. So, nice try.

You don't want a man
that's wired the other way.

1232
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:49,392
A man would have to be so broken
by society to be like, "I don't care

1233
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,187
what she looks like,
just don't let her spit in my food."

1234
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:54,522
- You want a man...
- [laughter]

1235
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:58,235
And rather than get angry about the way
that they're naturally wired,

1236
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,362
all while crying like,
"Accept me for who I am,

1237
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,155
but you better change who you are, boys."

1238
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,241
Rather than get angry at that,

1239
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:08,119
let's use this information,
rather than rage against the patriarchy.

1240
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,038
Let's use the information we have

1241
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,998
to work within the confines
of the structure...

1242
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,642
[croaking]...as we have for millennia.

1243
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,586
- [laughter]
- And gather information, okay?

1244
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,506
If he has to be attracted to you
in order to want to get to know you,

1245
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,550
that means he must be attracted to you
in order to stay with you.

1246
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,345
That means if he's with you,
he thinks you're beautiful

1247
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:29,432
and he does not see all the ugliness
that you think you see. Okay?

1248
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,934
- [cheering]
- Yes.

1249
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,395
He's incapable.

1250
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,607
All the problems
society says are wrong with you,

1251
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,859
he hasn't been brainwashed
into thinking that, okay?

1252
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,713
So when you were getting ready
like I was for the show and you're like,

1253
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:45,031
"I'm so fat.
They won't even let me in the building

1254
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:48,368
and asked me to resurface this whole...
Cover it up." [laughs]

1255
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,869
[audience laughs]

1256
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,038
He doesn't see any of it.

1257
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,957
He thinks you're beautiful.
Give him a break.

1258
00:54:54,582 --> 00:54:55,750
- Okay?
- [audience awws]

1259
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:58,420
[cheering, clapping]

1260
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,425
If he loves you, if this is a first date,

1261
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:05,802
- I don't fucking know what's gonna happen.
- [laughing]

1262
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,055
But men are very visual, women are not.

1263
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,140
We are cerebral.

1264
00:55:10,348 --> 00:55:14,060
We are cerebral creatures, which means
we don't have to be attracted to you

1265
00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:16,104
- to fall in love with you.
- [laughter]

1266
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:20,150
We're cerebral creatures, which means
we can fall in love with you...

1267
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,193
[shrieking]
...despite your stupid fucking face!

1268
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,446
[laughing, cheering]

1269
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,992
[clapping]

1270
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,995
Girls, if you're on a date,
don't cheer too loud.

1271
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,371
[indistinct grunting]

1272
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,040
[laughing]

1273
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,422
Every woman in this room
has at some point gone out with a man

1274
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,759
less attractive than she simply because...

1275
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,385
[warbled] "He makes me laugh."

1276
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,554
[audience laughs]

1277
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,145
[roaring laughter]

1278
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,404
It's true. Every woman,
at some point in her life,

1279
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,200
has gone out, dated, loved
an absolute fucking hobgoblin...

1280
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,492
[laughing]

1281
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,204
...simply because like,

1282
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,831
"He's real good with business"
or some shit, right?

1283
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:17,915
[laughter]

1284
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,585
And there's this weird allowance
we get as women

1285
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,880
where you are allowed to, like in public,

1286
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,592
say that the man you love
and are with is not attractive.

1287
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:29,302
[laughter]

1288
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,847
"But he's real, real sweet."
Like, in front of his face.

1289
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,140
[laughing]

1290
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,226
Like, at a dinner party.

1291
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,811
[continued laughing]

1292
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,687
You're allowed to be like, "Sean?

1293
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,731
I don't know. He's no Brad Pitt."

1294
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,025
[audience laughs]

1295
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,904
And Sean's
the first motherfucker to be like,

1296
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,240
- "Yeah, I am not an attractive man.
- [laughing]

1297
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,828
[cheering]

1298
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,250
But I own a boat
and I'm fucking her, so...

1299
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,625
Yeah!"

1300
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,877
[roaring cheers, laughter]

1301
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,216
[whooing]

1302
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,512
It's not okay.
No one loves to be called ugly,

1303
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,865
but when you call a guy ugly,
they're very honest about it

1304
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:18,893
because a man knows his worth
does not hinge on the way he looks,

1305
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:22,188
nor does it hinge
on the way people perceive his looks.

1306
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,190
When you're a girl,
that is an inextricable part

1307
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,650
of your experience on this planet

1308
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,319
and will be held against you
no matter what you look like.

1309
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,363
Obviously it's better
to be better-looking, but...

1310
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,489
[laughter]

1311
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,783
...when you're attractive at all,

1312
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,828
you are up for the slings and arrows
of judgment from men, women.

1313
00:57:36,911 --> 00:57:38,831
[drawl] "She's a skank."
"She must not be smart."

1314
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,458
"I bet she steals boyfriends."
"She's probably an idiot."

1315
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:44,181
If you're ugly, it's like,
"I bet she gets worse in the moonlight."

1316
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,753
- You're always...
- [laughing]

1317
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:50,425
Jobs, boyfriends, perception,
your rise in our society,

1318
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:54,095
hinges on your looks and other people's
take on the way that you look.

1319
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:57,599
For men, not so much
because they can still be charismatic

1320
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,851
and attractive to women,
even if they're hideous.

1321
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,936
You can have bad hair
and date a supermodel.

1322
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,689
You can be structurally-fucked
and still run the Free World.

1323
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:07,692
- Like, you can do these things.
- [laughing, cheering]

1324
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,781
[whoos]

1325
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,887
It's interesting because
we all wanna be treated equally,

1326
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,639
we all wanna be treated the same
but I don't think that's gonna happen

1327
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,999
for a very long time
because of the un-brainwashing

1328
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,794
we have to do with the way we treat
and perceive women based on their looks.

1329
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:29,797
It affects everything,
even if you're trying to be kind,

1330
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,467
it still affects it.
I will give you an example in real time.

1331
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:36,387
If I had a man here
and he was heckling me the whole show,

1332
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,681
ruining the show and just being an idiot,

1333
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,392
I could snap and I could say
something hacky like,

1334
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:45,563
"Well, you're bald and you're ugly and fat
and I bet you got a small dick," right?

1335
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:46,481
[laughing]

1336
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,900
And most of you laugh,
one person checked their phone.

1337
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,401
- No one's anger...
- [laughter]

1338
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,738
Even the one in the back was like...
[dowdy voice] "I got nothing to tweet.

1339
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:54,989
[audience laughs]

1340
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,323
Fair play."

1341
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,203
If I had a woman here
who was yelling at me,

1342
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:04,374
being rude, interrupting your show,
interrupting my night at work...

1343
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,627
This is a job, despite the fact
that I have purple lipstick on. Okay?

1344
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,128
- [laughing]
- And a fun ponytail.

1345
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,714
If she was doing that
and acting like an asshole

1346
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,134
and I snapped and I was like,
"Well, you're a fat, ugly bitch..."

1347
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:16,636
[oohs]

1348
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,429
[laughing]

1349
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,139
[clapping]

1350
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:22,392
She's not even real.

1351
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,185
[roaring laughter]

1352
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,730
[clapping, whooing]

1353
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,610
And you're like...
[screaming] "Don't shame her!"

1354
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,028
[shrieking]

1355
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,112
[puffs into mic]

1356
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,239
[cheering]

1357
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,032
A woman...

1358
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:40,577
As women, we are forced to be practical.

1359
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,371
We are forced to be honest
about things and our expectations

1360
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,497
and we are honest.

1361
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,833
A girl, we can be attracted
to ugly things.

1362
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:48,236
You hear girls all the time like,

1363
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:51,337
"My husband's got this weird tooth
in the back of his throat, but I love it.

1364
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,298
- [laughing]
- I like to lick on it. I love it.

1365
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,882
[continued laughing]

1366
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,969
He's so gross, sometimes he sheds
all his body hair. I eat that hair.

1367
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,280
- I love it so much.
- [laughter]

1368
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,264
- I make a pillow, I sleep on it.
- [cheering]

1369
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:02,347
I love it.

1370
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:04,684
He's ugly, I'm into it."

1371
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,185
You will never hear

1372
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,105
a guy be honest
about his girlfriend being ugly.

1373
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,648
'Cause he doesn't see it.

1374
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,900
You'll never hear,
"Oh, what a blithe existence!"

1375
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:16,279
You'll never hear a man admit
like, "My girlfriend...

1376
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,989
- [gurgles]
- [laughing]

1377
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,331
Sorry, I was just thinking
about her smile.

1378
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,625
[audience laughs]

1379
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,377
[exhales, groans]

1380
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,172
- It's fucked up, but...
- [laughing]

1381
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,425
...her punch lines are on fire."

1382
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,010
[audience laughs, cheers]

1383
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,141
Now you clap, but I noticed
that your laughter spiked

1384
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:47,435
- and then immediately declined...
- [laughing]

1385
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,854
...because you're still thinking
about this woman.

1386
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,939
[audience laughs]

1387
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,023
[mouths words]

1388
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:57,486
So no veil.

1389
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,405
[laughter]

1390
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,367
And I did not want a bachelorette party

1391
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:06,496
out at a bar
for a very specific reason, okay?

1392
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,205
I work at night,

1393
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,876
so I have seen first-hand the havoc

1394
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:16,130
that can be wreaked
by an out-of-control bachelorette party.

1395
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,799
- [whooing]
- Okay?

1396
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,804
It sounds like that. [chuckles]

1397
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:26,891
I have been there when a zombie horde

1398
01:01:26,974 --> 01:01:28,184
comes over the ridge,

1399
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:31,396
fucking kicks in a window
and makes their nests,

1400
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:32,730
like in my show.

1401
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,316
- [cawing] I've been there...
- [laughing]

1402
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:38,152
...when they come in,
one's missing a fucking femur.

1403
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,238
- [shrieking]
- [laughing continues]

1404
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,783
And knowing how out-of-control
they can get,

1405
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,286
I couldn't, in good conscience,
be that for a fellow night worker.

1406
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,415
I couldn't do that to someone else
who works at night, okay?

1407
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:53,167
- [woman whoos]
- Those of us, yes, who work at night!

1408
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,711
[cheering, clapping]

1409
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,047
Those of us who work at night.

1410
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,634
DJs, sound mixers, security,

1411
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,637
- bartenders, waitresses. Yes!
- [whooing]

1412
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,265
Yes, nighttime scientists, Nashville.

1413
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,350
- Yes, those of us...
- [audience laughs]

1414
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,562
...who make our wages
under the cloak of the moon.

1415
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,522
I have no friends. Those of us...

1416
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,605
[laughter]

1417
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:18,401
...who work at night know first-hand

1418
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:23,114
what it's like to have to absorb
a crazy bachelorette party.

1419
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:26,117
Okay? You don't see
a bachelorette party coming,

1420
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,452
you fucking hear it.

1421
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:30,747
[cheering]

1422
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,586
And if you're hearing it...

1423
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,297
- [guttural]...it's too late.
- [audience laughs]

1424
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,092
[high-pitched, shaky]
They're already here.

1425
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,218
[laughter]

1426
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:47,805
So you can imagine
how unnerving it is for me as a performer.

1427
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,849
I'm sitting here.
I can see the first couple rows,

1428
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,017
but the rest is pitch-black.

1429
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,355
You can imagine how terrifying that is
for me, just in the middle of a set

1430
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:58,983
in a sea of strangers and darkness like,
"And another thing about raccoons..."

1431
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:01,611
[shrieking] "Stacy's getting married!"

1432
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,863
[laughing]

1433
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,454
I don't know where it's coming from.
[gasps]

1434
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,580
[continued laughing]

1435
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,749
[hushed] Get back. Get back.

1436
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,961
Don't shoot till you see
the whites of their wines.

1437
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,463
[roaring laughter]

1438
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,632
[cheering]

1439
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,305
I want you to know something
about bachelorette parties.

1440
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:32,016
They are well-versed in the art
of basic tactical warfare.

1441
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,434
- Okay?
- [laughter]

1442
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,186
Bachelorette party knows

1443
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:37,730
that they have you trapped,
timid, trepidatious.

1444
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,054
[stern] The three Ts of combat.

1445
01:03:39,106 --> 01:03:40,666
- They got you right there.
- [laughing]

1446
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,378
And they know that you don't know
where they're coming from

1447
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:46,155
and they know that you are expecting
all of them

1448
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,740
to come running in at once.

1449
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:50,284
But a good bachelorette party,
a good bachelorette army knows

1450
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,745
you don't send in all of your troops
at once.

1451
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,664
[audience laughs]

1452
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:59,293
A well-led bachelorette party understands
you must send your troops in in waves

1453
01:03:59,877 --> 01:04:01,254
so as to exhaust the bar...

1454
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,630
[laughter]

1455
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,423
...and deplete it of its resources.

1456
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:07,927
If you are at a bar and you see
a bunch of girls come running in,

1457
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,303
do not be foolish.

1458
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:10,596
That is not the bride.

1459
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:12,640
That is not even the family.

1460
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,934
- That is her infantry.
- [audience laughs]

1461
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,478
These are her bannermen.

1462
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:20,314
They come running in first
to let the bar know like...

1463
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,942
- [shrieking] "Stacy's getting married!"
- [laughing]

1464
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:24,819
[continued shrieking]

1465
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,071
[shrieks]
They kick some girls out of a booth.

1466
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,914
"This is our territory now.
Get out of here!"

1467
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,867
They set a waitress on fire.

1468
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,368
[whooshing into mic, caws]

1469
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,704
[audience laughs]

1470
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:36,914
[nasally] Isn't this amazing?

1471
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,666
- [shrieks]
- [laughing]

1472
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,795
They put down a debit card
for the first round.

1473
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,214
Get fresh with the table. [shrieks]

1474
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,339
[laughter]

1475
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,468
These women are not there
for a good time or a long time.

1476
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:50,678
- Okay?
- [audience laughs]

1477
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,389
These women are there for one reason.

1478
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,474
[stern] To establish
and maintain a region.

1479
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,185
- That's why they're there.
- [laughing]

1480
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:01,063
[cheering, clapping]

1481
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:06,611
And they fought valiantly
and the battlefield has been set.

1482
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:09,280
Now the bar knows
that it's Stacy's bachelorette party

1483
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,197
and what to expect.

1484
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,532
The next one to come in

1485
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:14,634
is perhaps the most important one
of the party, or so she thinks.

1486
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,287
This is your General,

1487
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:18,998
otherwise known
as your maid of honor, Amanda!

1488
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,958
[laughter, whoos]

1489
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:24,253
I am Stacy's maid of honor.

1490
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:27,006
Many of you know me
from the Evite comment section

1491
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:28,925
where I've chatted with you briefly.

1492
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:30,259
[audience laughs]

1493
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,678
[gruff] XOXO.

1494
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,221
[laughter]

1495
01:05:34,472 --> 01:05:37,475
I am Stacy's best friend
since the third grade.

1496
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:42,146
A fact I shall lord over many of you
when I feel left out of a conversation.

1497
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,357
[laughing]

1498
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:46,067
She is my best friend.

1499
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:48,527
We've been to Cancún upwards
of five times.

1500
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:49,654
[continued laughing]

1501
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,257
I've sat in the hotel room
many a night while she's been out,

1502
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,841
making out with hot dudes
and promises to tell me about it later.

1503
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,160
I am the best friend.

1504
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,536
[audience laughs]

1505
01:05:58,412 --> 01:05:59,747
She is the one to be married,

1506
01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:02,291
but in many ways,
I feel like tonight is about me.

1507
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,375
[laughing]

1508
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:08,673
I have set up all of this.
I have made all the reservations.

1509
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:10,341
I am the one you will follow

1510
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,468
and before we ride into battle,

1511
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,596
I need each of you to Venmo me $50.

1512
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,931
Will you ride with me?

1513
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:18,975
[uproarious cheering]

1514
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:24,981
[whoos]

1515
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,274
It was $40, but Megan's not feeling well

1516
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,484
and she just canceled.

1517
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:29,819
[audience laughs]

1518
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,822
Before the festivities begin,

1519
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,700
I wish to open with a quote
from General Patton.

1520
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,577
- [laughter]
- To go bravely... Morgan.

1521
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,872
Morgan, Morgan, Morgan.
Drink some fucking water, I'm not joking.

1522
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,332
- Heyah!
- [audience laughs]

1523
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:48,879
The bartender's like,
"You can't have a horse in here."

1524
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,464
[laughing]

1525
01:06:52,925 --> 01:06:54,051
Very well, then.

1526
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:58,073
If I give you my phone,
will you charge it behind the bar?

1527
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,974
- No, okay. Heyah!
- [uproarious laughter]

1528
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,810
[clapping, cackling]

1529
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,563
[whooing]

1530
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,149
The time has come.

1531
01:07:08,733 --> 01:07:10,401
She is about to arrive.

1532
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,530
- [ceremonial call]
- [cheering]

1533
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:17,700
[indistinct grunting]

1534
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,329
- [rattling breath and screams]
- [cheering continues]

1535
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:26,042
- [shrieking]
- [laughing]

1536
01:07:26,917 --> 01:07:30,046
They all begin to scream.
[shrieking] "She's getting married."

1537
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:30,963
[laughter]

1538
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,507
[continued shrieking]

1539
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,675
[audience laughs]

1540
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,177
[shrieks] We know.

1541
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:38,220
Bachelorette partygoers of the world,

1542
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,138
we know!

1543
01:07:39,221 --> 01:07:41,766
- Quit screaming, you fucking banshee.
- [laughter]

1544
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:45,227
We know she's getting married,
we can tell,

1545
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,897
because she's covered in dicks.

1546
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:50,983
[audience laughs, cheers]

1547
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:59,033
[clapping]

1548
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,495
Why? What is this West African
shaming ritual?

1549
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,579
[laughing]

1550
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,706
What is that? Why are we doing that?

1551
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:07,750
Why are we, every night in America,

1552
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:11,796
drenching our women
in teeny-weeny Party City peeny?

1553
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,839
[laughter]

1554
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,383
I know what your friends will say.

1555
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,428
[upbeat] "It's 'cause we love her.
We love her so much. She's amazing."

1556
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:23,140
[booming] Dicks! Dicks! Wear these dicks!
Be a dick! Eat a dick!

1557
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:24,975
- My issue... [chuckles]
- [laughter]

1558
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:31,065
...is not the ritualistic shrouding
of women

1559
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,776
in tiny, plastic commemorative penii.

1560
01:08:33,859 --> 01:08:35,277
[audience laughs]

1561
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,614
My issue is merely
the lack of reciprocity

1562
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,449
at a bachelor party.

1563
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,952
[cheering]

1564
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,579
[whooing]

1565
01:08:47,832 --> 01:08:50,000
I've never seen a bachelor party

1566
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:53,170
like, "Joey's getting married,
everybody put on your snootch-hat."

1567
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:55,756
[laughing]

1568
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,217
[grunting]

1569
01:08:59,343 --> 01:09:00,928
[cheering]

1570
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,637
[groaning]

1571
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,641
- [continued grunting]
- [laughing]

1572
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,686
[whooing]

1573
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,566
- "It's so tight, bro. [groans]
- [laughing continues]

1574
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,443
Isn't it crazy how no matter
how many times you wear them,

1575
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:17,927
they never lose their elasticity...

1576
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,614
- [cheering]
- ...although we tell women that,

1577
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,492
to shame them
out of exploring their sexuality?"

1578
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,744
[clapping]

1579
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:32,293
[laughter, whooing]

1580
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,796
Of all the things I did not want to do

1581
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:38,591
for my wedding,
the one thing we ended up doing

1582
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,010
was they had a bachelorette party
at a bar for me.

1583
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:44,847
Obviously, I'm not gonna
have a party at a library. So...

1584
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,015
[audience laughs]

1585
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,535
...we had this bachelorette party
at a bar and we went.

1586
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:52,021
And I had about four
or five women with me and...

1587
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,191
I know I should have been
just like going crazy and getting drunk

1588
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,443
and having a crazy time
but I'm a sentimental person

1589
01:09:57,693 --> 01:10:00,696
and I'm a thinker
and I was looking at these girls,

1590
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:03,365
these women that some of whom
I was related to,

1591
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:05,242
the rest of whom
I've known my entire life.

1592
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:09,663
I've seen relationships come and go
and jobs and heartbreak and death

1593
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:13,000
and all of the landmarks
and all the things that make us human

1594
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:16,295
and I was with these girls and I realized
that we had all been single,

1595
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:18,005
we had all been on a journey together,

1596
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:21,383
and for me that part of my journey
with them stopped that night.

1597
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,428
I can still go to bars,
if my husband says it's okay.

1598
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,888
[laughter]

1599
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,849
But like we've been going out
for like a decade together,

1600
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,813
like looking for a good time,
looking for a guy.

1601
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,186
And like, that was it for me.

1602
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,456
And I thought that...
I get goosebumps thinking about it

1603
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,982
because like that chapter of my life
was closed that night

1604
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:41,946
and I think that there's something
very poetic about the notion

1605
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:45,532
that your bachelorette party,
you are in effect

1606
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:50,246
picking up the ashen, lifeless body
of your singlehood...

1607
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,789
[laughing]

1608
01:10:52,623 --> 01:10:55,417
[strained]...and laying it to rest
where it was born.

1609
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:57,711
[audience laughs]

1610
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,423
In a shitty bar.

1611
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:04,343
[uproarious cheering]

1612
01:11:08,847 --> 01:11:10,432
[clapping]

1613
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,049
And it's not that I would never be
at another bar again,

1614
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,729
but I would never be
at another bar unmarried.

1615
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:16,647
I mean, I don't know

1616
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,857
- but I would never be...
- [laughing]

1617
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:21,151
I would never be... at that time,

1618
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,486
like, that was it for me.

1619
01:11:22,569 --> 01:11:25,030
And I looked around the room
and there was a group of girls,

1620
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,949
same amount as us, in their 20s. [hisses]

1621
01:11:27,032 --> 01:11:28,117
And they were over there.

1622
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,034
[audience laughs]

1623
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,245
[nasally] They looked amazing
and they were over there

1624
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:33,665
and I was just staring at them.
And they're like,

1625
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,749
- "Who's that old lady staring at us?"
- [laughing]

1626
01:11:36,208 --> 01:11:39,503
Because they were us
and I remember so fondly

1627
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:43,757
being that age and going out
and all the trappings of it.

1628
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,719
I know so much about it, I wrote
four fucking Netflix specials about it.

1629
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:47,636
[laughter]

1630
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,513
- And that was over.
- [cheering]

1631
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:56,061
And I was reflecting on
those years versus these years

1632
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:57,229
as you get older.

1633
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,606
In your 20s, you should just know,

1634
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,276
you will never be as close
to other people,

1635
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:04,278
let alone other women,
as you are in your 20s.

1636
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:06,488
You will have good friends.
You will have book clubs.

1637
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,372
You will have all this stuff
as you get older,

1638
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:11,744
but in your 20s, you've just
come out of high school or college.

1639
01:12:11,827 --> 01:12:15,456
You're very close to the realms
of academia and you are hive-minded.

1640
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:17,666
So you are in each other's shit,
you know everything.

1641
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,670
"I know who texted... He's my boyfriend,
I know who you are, who you like.

1642
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,881
I like you, you're my best friend.
Matching dove tattoos. Make 'em fuck.

1643
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:25,841
Dove tattoos. Right there. [cooing]

1644
01:12:25,924 --> 01:12:27,319
- You're my best friend.
- [laughing]

1645
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:28,427
I love you so much."

1646
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:31,847
And boys ask you dumb questions that you
tolerate 'cause you don't know any better.

1647
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,933
When you're in your 20s, boys will ask,
"How many guys you slept with?"

1648
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:39,188
Nobody asks you that in your 30s
because the answer is gross.

1649
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,190
[audience laughs]

1650
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:42,399
[cheering]

1651
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:46,653
She's in the back.

1652
01:12:46,737 --> 01:12:49,114
[dowdy voice]
"I've slept with so many dudes. I dunno.

1653
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,198
[laughter]

1654
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:51,700
I feel empowered."

1655
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:52,784
[audience laughs]

1656
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,123
But in your 20s, you're right there
and you're in that mentality,

1657
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:00,125
you're so intertwined
and you make packs like,

1658
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:02,490
"We're going out together.
I don't care if you meet a boy.

1659
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,464
We're going home together.
You're my best friend.

1660
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:06,065
Hold my hand. We're going out together.

1661
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,341
[gruff] Tie your hand to mine.

1662
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,986
My best friend. I'm a Sagittarius,
you're a Pisces. How's it work?

1663
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,845
Dunno, it just does.
Text me when you're home.

1664
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:14,032
That's right, we're home,
we live together. Roll over.

1665
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:15,736
You're my best friend.
You're right there."

1666
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:16,892
[audience laughs]

1667
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,770
People shit on women
for some reason being 30.

1668
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,453
I understand
there's the whole egg issue,

1669
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,148
but society is not kind.

1670
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,025
They're not kind to women
as they get older.

1671
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:27,069
Men, shitty men,
not the good ones that are here,

1672
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,946
- don't like it as women age.
- [laughter]

1673
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,469
And I gotta believe it's less
about the fact that you're older

1674
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:33,532
and it's more about the fact
that when you're older

1675
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:36,370
you don't put up with bullshit
and they don't like that.

1676
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:37,913
- [cheering]
- They don't like it.

1677
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:41,959
- [clapping]
- Smart guys don't have any bullshit.

1678
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,085
[whooing]

1679
01:13:44,128 --> 01:13:45,963
I was at a bar the other night,

1680
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,464
some guy walked up, he goes, "Hey."

1681
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:50,175
I was like, "I don't buy it."
And I just walked away.

1682
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,260
[roaring laughter]

1683
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,847
But moreover, you're close
and you're a cluster of girls

1684
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:57,200
and you go out together
and no matter what plans you make,

1685
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:59,977
there's always that one girlfriend
that breaks away from the pack.

1686
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,180
You're like, "We're here for safety."
She's like, "I'm just gonna talk to him."

1687
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:04,689
[laughter]

1688
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:06,900
Some fucking idiot with the dumbest line,

1689
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:08,784
but you're in your 20s,
so you'll listen to it

1690
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,362
'cause you haven't lived a life yet.

1691
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,646
"I'm just gonna talk to him."
He's like, "Yeah, come on.

1692
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:15,242
I'll tell you about my company,
Herbalife, let's go. I run..."

1693
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:16,827
[laughing]

1694
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:19,455
And she's not making your job easier.

1695
01:14:19,538 --> 01:14:22,124
You're also out to meet a guy,
to have fun, to have a life,

1696
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:24,087
and you're like,
"Get back here, Cassandra. No."

1697
01:14:24,126 --> 01:14:26,962
And you have to endure
this fucking piece of shit being like,

1698
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:30,132
"Why are you being such bitches?"
But you wanna protect your girlfriend.

1699
01:14:30,215 --> 01:14:32,134
You're like, "Get back here,
she's not awake.

1700
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,261
- Come here. Come here."
- [audience laughs]

1701
01:14:34,928 --> 01:14:36,180
We will do anything.

1702
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:39,683
When you're younger, we will form
a phalanx around a fallen girl like...

1703
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,351
[swishing]

1704
01:14:41,518 --> 01:14:43,395
- [puffs into mic]
- [laughter]

1705
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:46,899
[nasally] Sorry.

1706
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:48,442
[uproarious laughter]

1707
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:50,777
[cheering]

1708
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,533
[clapping]

1709
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,785
That noise right there
is the anti-mating call

1710
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:00,829
- of 20-something girls everywhere.
- [laughter]

1711
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:04,708
[nasally] "Sorry." That's right, girls,
before there was <i>RuPaul's Drag Race...</i>

1712
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,835
[nasally]..."bye", there was "sorry."

1713
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,212
[laughing]

1714
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:11,465
It's us protecting a girl
who can't protect ourselves.

1715
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:14,301
Now, I wish I could tell you that
that action is solely altruistic

1716
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:16,887
and when we do it,
it's just for the benefit of that girl.

1717
01:15:16,970 --> 01:15:19,515
Unfortunately, oftentimes,
the subtext of,

1718
01:15:19,598 --> 01:15:22,684
"You can't have her" is
"because you didn't want me."

1719
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,728
- But that's a whole other lecture...
- [laughter]

1720
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:25,896
...and special.

1721
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:27,105
[cheering]

1722
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:28,857
[clapping]

1723
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,778
In closing, girls, enjoy the sovereignty

1724
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:35,322
of the protection of other women
when you're in your 20s

1725
01:15:35,405 --> 01:15:37,032
'cause guess what, chickens?

1726
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:40,118
After 30, it's not that we don't love you,

1727
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,954
haven't spent a lifetime with you,

1728
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:45,749
it's that we're sick
and tired of your bullshit, Jamie!

1729
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:49,294
We're tired of following you around,
looking for you at bars,

1730
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,018
when we should be out
doing our own thing.

1731
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:54,216
We're exhausted,
our patience has run thin,

1732
01:15:54,299 --> 01:15:56,677
so is this delicate under-eye skin
I'm finding out.

1733
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,053
- [laughing]
- We're tired.

1734
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:00,389
After 30, we are not your keepers anymore.

1735
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:02,599
After 30, we're gonna be like...

1736
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:06,562
[gruff] "Go with him!
We want to see what happens."

1737
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,645
