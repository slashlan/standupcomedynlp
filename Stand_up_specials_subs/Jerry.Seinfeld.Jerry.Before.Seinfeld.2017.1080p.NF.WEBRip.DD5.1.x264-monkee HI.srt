[Johnny Carson] My uh...

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,054
...next guest is a young comedian
making his debut on The Tonight Show.

4
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,472
He is from New York City.

5
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,183
He's worked a lot of small clubs,
both in New York and Los Angeles.

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,810
Welcome him, please; Jerry Seinfeld.

7
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,896
[Jerry Seinfeld] In mid-70s New York,

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,983
there were only two places
you could even see new comedians.

9
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,569
A stand-up comedian
was just a novelty act.

10
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,196
They would have one
in front of a singer or a rock band,

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,283
and just to be that
was the most glorious dream of my life.

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,826
That's all I wanted.

13
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,203
And it's funny,
but I was actually sitting on a ledge

14
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,122
when I decided to make that leap,

15
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,040
right here.

16
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,500
And this is the exact spot.

How do you like the jacket?

44
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,503
[cheering]

45
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,963
Yeah, this is my favorite jacket.

46
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,091
It's a special night
and I want to wear my special jacket,

47
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,760
because I'm back at the Comic Strip,

48
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,847
which is where I started
my entire career -

49
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,057
right here, on this stage.

50
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,142
[cheering]

51
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,483
And uh I'll tell you the whole story.

52
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,527
I'll tell you how it all happened.

53
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,445
I was living in Massapequa.

54
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,197
I'm born in Brooklyn.

55
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,616
That's my home borough.

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,036
And then my parents moved out
to Massapequa, which is an Indian name.

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,663
It means "by the mall."

58
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,165
[laughter]

59
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,001
Even the Native Americans could sense,

60
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:51,170
once the Jews
and the Italians get out here...

61
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,257
brick-and-mortar retail's going to crush.

62
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:57,802
Let's lose the teepees.
These people need parking.

63
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,304
[laughter and applause]

64
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:06,060
So we moved out from the city
to on Long Island.

65
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,147
You don't live in Long Island,
you live on Long Island.

66
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,066
When you live in the city,
people ask you, "Where do you live?"

67
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,359
you go, "We live in the city."

68
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,153
You don't live on the city.

69
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,237
[laughter]

70
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,989
But if you move out of the city...

71
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,868
You're in it now. Now if you go out,
you're going to be on the island.

72
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:22,952
[laughter]

73
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,038
Long Island's
not one of those places you...

74
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,332
You can't get in it. There's nothing...

75
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,418
There's nothing to get in.
You just stay on it.

76
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,502
[laughter]

77
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,465
My parents would say, "Jerry, we're going
to the city today, so get ready."

78
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,549
We're going in."

79
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,718
"We're going to get on the train."

80
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,178
We don't get in the train.

81
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,222
You get on the train,

82
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,891
even though you see trains,
there's nobody on it.

83
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,810
You never see anybody on top of a train.

84
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,106
But that's how you talk. If you want
to live here, this is how you talk.

85
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,318
"We're going to get on the train."
Why do you get on the train?

86
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,570
Why?

87
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,198
So you can get off it!

88
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,283
"Get off the train!

89
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,202
This is our stop!"

90
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,370
[laughter]

91
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,623
"We've got to get in the cab."

92
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,583
You don't get on the cab.

93
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,586
You were on the train,
but you don't get on the cab.

94
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,922
You get in the cab.

95
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,132
Why do you get in the cab?

96
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,010
So you can get out!

97
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,553
"You've got to get out of the...

98
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,515
We're here.
Get out of the cab. We're here."

99
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,394
"Why are you still in the cab?
Get out of the cab."

100
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,603
[laughter]

101
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,022
"OK, Jerry, what about Uber?
What do you do with Uber?"

102
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,190
That's the new thing.

103
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,275
Do you get in it? No.

104
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,609
On it? No.

105
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:37,735
Off it? No.

106
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,487
What do you do with Uber?

107
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,197
- [man] You grab it.
- [man] You get one.

108
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,532
No. No.

109
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,866
[woman] You just take it.

110
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,703
You take it! You take Uber!

111
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,829
[laughter]

112
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,123
Because there's no money!

113
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,959
It's, like, free.
I don't even know how it works.

114
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,168
Do we even pay for that?

115
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,461
[laughter]

116
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,006
I think it's just a free thing,
comes with the phone.

117
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,382
Any time you're just like...

118
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,718
Little cartoon cars,
they go wherever you want.

119
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,511
"How did you get here?"
"We took an Uber.

120
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,721
I don't know, we just..."

121
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,889
It's like M&Ms in a bowl,
you just take them.

122
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,766
Just take whatever you want.

123
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,851
[laughter]

124
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,438
And uh so I came here

125
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,149
and I auditioned on this stage,

126
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,526
and the little sign-up sheet is outside,

127
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,154
that I wrote with my little
"Jerry Seinfeld."

128
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:24,157
You know, it was just my parents' address,

129
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,909
and "type of act: comedian."

130
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,747
"Any special requirements? No."

131
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
[laughter]

132
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,335
And I only had one joke that worked...

133
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,420
[laughter]

134
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,589
...which I'm going to do for you
right now.

135
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,382
And...

136
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,717
[cheering and applause]

137
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,930
If you ever think yourself

138
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,059
that you might want to someday do comedy,

139
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,894
this is not the way you do it.

140
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:57,106
Don't ever say,
"I'm going to tell you a joke now."

141
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,399
[laughter]

142
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,650
So, I'm left-handed.

143
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,986
Left-handed people do not like

144
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,615
that the word "left" is so often
associated with negative things.

145
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,825
Two left feet, left-handed compliment.

146
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,203
"What are we having for dinner?"
"Leftovers."

147
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,662
[laughter]

148
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,791
You go to a party, nobody's there.
"Where did everybody go?" "They left."

149
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,875
[laughter]

150
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:16,959
[applause]

151
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:19,670
That was it.

152
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,047
That was my first joke.

153
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,131
[cheering]

154
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,716
[laughs]

155
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,096
And it was a pretty good joke,

156
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,681
and uh they passed me on the audition,

157
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,476
and I started coming here
every single night.

158
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,521
So, I grew up in the '60s,

159
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,274
and I see a lot of beautiful
young people here tonight,

160
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,360
enjoying your life of uh...

161
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,904
infinite potential and opportunity.

162
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,239
[laughter]

163
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:49,992
Because you're young
and your life is still ahead of you,

164
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,661
and it's all going to happen.

165
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,412
Let me tell you little punks something!

166
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,747
[laughter and applause]

167
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,750
You didn't even have a childhood.

168
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,043
You had nothing!

169
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,128
[laughter]

170
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,881
You had garbage
compared to what we had in the '60s.

171
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:08,553
And you know why?
Your parents paid attention to you, OK?

172
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,180
They were interested in you.

173
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,851
My parents, our parents,
they didn't even know our names, OK?

174
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,187
They were ignorant, they were negligent,
they were checked-out.

175
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,315
We grew up like wild dogs in the '60s!

176
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,650
[laughter]

177
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,861
There was no nutrition.

178
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,824
Nothing... of knowledge of nutrition,

179
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,285
education, safety.

180
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:36,414
Can you even imagine
the world I am describing?

181
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,623
[laughter]

182
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,042
No helmets, no seat belts,

183
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,252
no restraints.

184
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,753
Anything came to a stop,

185
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,464
we just flew through the air.

186
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,798
[laughter and applause]

187
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,761
I was either eating 100% sugar,

188
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,221
or airborne.

189
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,306
[laughter]

190
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,099
That was my childhood.

191
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,729
My parents, they did not know
where my school was,

192
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,814
they did know what my grades were,

193
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,357
they didn't know where I was.

194
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,486
I was like a raccoon to my parents.

195
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,696
You know there's one around,

196
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,741
but no one's tracking
the actual whereabouts.

197
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,075
[laughter]

198
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,785
I would roll out of bed

199
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,412
and I would do a swan dive

200
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,664
into Cocoa Puffs, Frosted Flakes,

201
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,335
Lucky Charms, Fruit Loops, Sugar Pops.

202
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,586
[laughter]

203
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,507
I'm getting a little light-headed right
now, actually, just thinking about it.

204
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,800
It was so amazing, and it was great -

205
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,469
we were getting away with murder!

206
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,347
Life cereal - that was ballsy, huh?

207
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,099
That's a ballsy name, I always thought.

208
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,392
"Life"!

209
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,687
"What are we going to call this?
How about Oaties? Squaries?"

210
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,898
"Oh, no. This is much bigger than that."

211
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,316
[laughter]

212
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,401
"This is Life, I tell you!"

213
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,862
"It's Life!"

214
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,162
What were the other names? How about
Almighty God? Why don't we call it that?

215
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,248
Who wouldn't want to wake up

216
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,625
to a nice big bowl of Almighty God?

217
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,920
Or New Almighty God with Raisins.

218
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,004
[laughter]

219
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,757
And if you don't like it,
you can go to hell.

220
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,841
[laughter]

221
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,183
So the beauty of the time, OK?

222
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,520
Parents, for some reason,
had no idea or no interest

223
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,064
that there's no food in any of this.

224
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,651
And it was great
until the Cookie Crisp people came along

225
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,820
and blew the lid off of the whole racket.

226
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,737
[laughter]

227
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:36,284
There's always somebody who pushes
a good thing just a little too far.

228
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,703
Cookie Crisp.

229
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,162
[laughter]

230
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,331
If you don't know what this is,
this is a cereal...

231
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,834
It's not like cookies,

232
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,669
it is cookies.

233
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,129
[laughter]

234
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,673
This is your breakfast.

235
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,845
A bowl of chocolate-chip cookies!

236
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:56,929
[laughter]

237
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,516
This cereal should have been called
The Hell With Everything!

238
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,601
[laughter]

239
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,980
Ice cream for lunch, cake for dinner,
bacon and cigarettes in between. That's...

240
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,941
That's the Cookie Crisp total health plan.

241
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,026
[laughter]

242
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,446
I liked the Good Humor man.
I would wait for him.

243
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,907
That was another huge thing of life,
the guy who was the...

244
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,577
You hear that little jingle bell,
and the white truck,

245
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,955
and the little white suit, and we would
stand in line behind the truck,

246
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,250
and all the different ice creams that you
could get was on the back of the truck,

247
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,210
placed right over the exhaust pipe.

248
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,295
[laughter]

249
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,964
If you had a Dixie Cup,
it was the equivalent

250
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,591
of smoking a pack of Camels.

251
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,884
[laughter]

252
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,844
Nobody cared!

253
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,305
These were good times!

254
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,681
[laughs]

255
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,309
[movie projector whirring]

256
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,065
[Jerry] There was no drama in my life,

257
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,484
or in my family, or in my world.

258
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,195
Would I have been funnier
if I grew up in Peoria

259
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,197
in a whorehouse, raised by prostitutes?

260
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,865
Absolutely.

261
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,950
But this is what I had to work with.

262
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,496
My parents were really nice,
Betty and Kal.

263
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,791
I had a wonderful older sister, Carolyn.
It was a nice family.

264
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,169
But I just always felt, like,
"Could you just leave me alone?"

265
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,963
My first thing I ever said -
my first words were, "Leave me alone."

266
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,135
I used to knock over lamps or something,
and they used to say, "Leave it alone."

267
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,804
And then, one day, I yelled back,

268
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,930
"Leave me alone."

269
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,059
I just didn't want the normal thing.

270
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,395
I just didn't want anything normal.

271
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,857
I just thought, "That world
that these people live in is very boring",

272
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,151
and I want to be in a more fun place."

273
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,569
[laughter]

274
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,905
I had glasses at ten, braces at 12.

275
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,949
I said to my parents, "Let's not stop now."

276
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,867
How about a hearing aid,
orthopedic shoes?"

277
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,785
[laughter]

278
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,747
"I'm thinking about talking to a girl
for the very first time in my life."

279
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,210
I want as much corrective apparatus
on my head as I can possibly get.

280
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:52,878
"I think that's what women like."

281
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:54,255
[laughter]

282
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,965
I had a yo-yo. I-I liked that.

283
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,383
The yo-yo was pretty great.

284
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,801
That was one of my good toys.

285
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,095
I could do the yo-yo pretty good.

286
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,513
And I read about the yo-yo

287
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:06,600
and found out the yo-yo was originally
invented as a weapon in the Philippines.

288
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,103
An interesting
and obscure piece of information.

289
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:14,650
Hard to imagine
Filipino tribesmen warring with yo-yos.

290
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,862
Planes flying low over enemy villages,

291
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,155
they lean out the door...

292
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,239
[clicks tongue]

293
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,323
[laughter]

294
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,243
"I think I got the chief."

295
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,327
[laughter]

296
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,414
But I didn't have...

297
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,293
You know, there was no Chuck E. Cheese
and Toys "R" Us.

298
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,711
There was none of that.

299
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,672
So, you know, you just did
whatever your parents were doing.

300
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,550
Wherever they had to go,
you know, I would go.

301
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,303
So, my mother would want to go
to the wallpaper store,

302
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,013
that was my day, you know?

303
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,265
And that was my mother's favorite store.

304
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,642
She loved those giant books of wallpaper.

305
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,603
She would read them, turn the pages.

306
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,062
It was like the Koran.

307
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,189
[exhales]

308
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,608
Huge. She was looking at the patterns.

309
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,860
"Yes, I understand what they're saying."

310
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,777
[laughter]

311
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,863
[exhales]

312
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,533
And when you're a little kid
in these places, you can't really take it.

313
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,410
You know, the boredom is so intense,

314
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,786
it's so powerful.

315
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,704
[laughter]

316
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,458
When you're five and you get bored,
you cannot support your body weight.

317
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,919
You literally just... I would just...

318
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,047
I would just get down. I had to get down.

319
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,131
[laughter]

320
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,926
I remember going to the bank
with my parents,

321
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,552
and you don't even know what a bank is.

322
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,181
You just say, "Oh, I can't handle this.
I don't even know what this is."

323
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,225
And I would lie down, flat.

324
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,518
Flat. Just...

325
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:35,105
"Sorry, Mom. There's nothing I can do.
This place is so dull, I cannot get up."

326
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,190
[laughter]

327
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,442
This is what I think adulthood is.

328
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,819
Adulthood is the ability
to be totally bored

329
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,446
and remain standing.

330
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,531
[laughter]

331
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,909
You're in a long line somewhere,
no problem.

332
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,955
I wasn't going to Disneyland, OK?

333
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,040
That's not... That's not going to happen.

334
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,209
It wasn't one of those things
that you could do.

335
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,503
My parents were not taking me...

336
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,297
thousands of miles to another state

337
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,882
so I could sit in a teacup.

338
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,967
[laughter]

339
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,678
Both of my parents were orphans,

340
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,931
so the fact that I had a room with a bed,
they were like,

341
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,058
"That's your ride. You can go on that."

342
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,142
[laughter]

343
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,310
"You're fine."

344
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:14,979
And I was fine.

345
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,730
Sometimes, outside of these stores,

346
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,692
they would have, like, two red,
metal horses on the sidewalk,

347
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,360
and that was pretty good.

348
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,071
If you could get ten cents and...
It wasn't a ride.

349
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,115
You know, it was kind of a piece,

350
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,284
just a fragment chipped off of a ride

351
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,035
that landed there somehow.

352
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,663
And it didn't do anything
that would make you go, "Whee!"

353
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,291
It would just kind of grind
forward and back.

354
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,376
[imitates mechanical grinding]

355
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,878
[laughter]

356
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,713
It was like a grain-elevator motor

357
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,215
with just two horses welded on top.

358
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,301
[imitates mechanical grinding]

359
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,888
"Are we milling buckwheat
or am I at an amusement park here?"

360
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,598
[imitates mechanical grinding]

361
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,099
[laughter]

362
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,895
But compared to lying on the floor of
the bank, this was Space Mountain to me.

363
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,023
You know, I thought it was great.
I would get off. "Mom, that was fantastic!"

364
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,609
I feel 1,000% better.

365
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,943
I'm refreshed, I'm calm.

366
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,404
"I'm ready for the wallpaper store.
Want to go back there?"

367
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,530
[laughter]

368
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,575
"I'm into it. Throw pillows,
window treatments. Let's do it."

369
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,659
[laughter]

370
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,454
My mother, she was always talking to me

371
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,081
about uh... what she was going to do
with the living room.

372
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,249
This was her obsession.

373
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,044
She was going to fix the living room,
change the living room.

374
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:25,049
My mother would say, "You know,
if you make one wall of a room a mirror",

375
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,968
people think you have
an entire other room."

376
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,053
[laughter]

377
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,263
They believe this.

378
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,142
What kind of an idiot
walks up to a mirror...

379
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,685
[laughter]

380
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,188
...and goes, "Look,
there's a whole other room in there"?

381
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,397
[laughter]

382
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,942
There's a guy in there
that looks just like me.

383
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,026
[laughter]

384
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,447
And my parakeet would fall for this.
I would let him out of his cage.

385
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,700
I always felt bad that he was in a cage,
so I would let him out,

386
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,702
and he would fly around,
and he would go "bang,"

387
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,372
right into the mirror
with his little head,

388
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,165
and the feathers would fly,

389
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:00,960
and he would hit the ground,
then fly off in another direction,

390
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,211
a little askew.

391
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,420
[laughter]

392
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,048
But even if he thinks
the mirror is another room,

393
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,426
why doesn't he at least try and avoid
hitting the other parakeet?

394
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,719
[laughter]

395
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,554
Look up!

396
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,473
What happened to bird's-eye view?

397
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,309
There's a... There's another parakeet
coming right at you!

398
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,686
[laughter]

399
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:22,648
But I couldn't take childhood
at a certain point. You get tired of it.

400
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,110
You actually get... I just couldn't build
one more balsa-wood glider.

401
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,194
[laughter]

402
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,029
You know what I wanted to do?

403
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,366
I wanted to do certain little adult
behaviors that I would see adults do.

404
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,661
Like uh... I liked the way adults
checked their pockets when I was a kid.

405
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,039
This is actually something I thought
as kid. I liked the way adults did this.

406
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,249
"Do you have those...?"

407
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,459
"I can't find those keys.

408
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,546
Bill, do you have my keys?
I can't find the keys."

409
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:48,549
When you're a kid, if someone asks
if you have something, you say, "No."

410
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,633
[laughter]

411
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,469
Anything you own is in your hand.

412
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,347
"Are you sure?"
You spread the fingers wider.

413
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,016
"No, I don't. I don't have it."

414
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,100
[laughter]

415
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:01,937
I wanted to ruin my appetite.

416
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,523
I got tired of hearing,
"You're going to ruin your appetite."

417
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,733
"Ruin your appetite."

418
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,360
As adults, we understand
even if you ruin an appetite,

419
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,612
there's another appetite
coming right behind it.

420
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,866
There's no danger
of running out of appetites.

421
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,618
I could ruin 100,
I still got thousands more.

422
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,911
[laughter]

423
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,415
Why am I being so careful with each one?
I've got millions of appetites!

424
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,499
[laughter]

425
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,087
I wanted to mess with the thermostat -

426
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,548
that was another thing
they wouldn't let me go near.

427
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,883
I don't know what the story...

428
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,761
When I was a kid, "What is with
that thing? Why can't I go near it?"

429
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,845
[laughter]

430
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,766
I even remember when my parents sat me
down to tell me the birds, the bees,

431
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,309
intercourse, procreation.

432
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,228
I'm like, "Yeah, when does
the thermostat come in here?"

433
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,273
"That's the secret
I'm waiting to find out."

434
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:47,357
[laughter]

435
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,819
I didn't touch a thermostat
until I was 28 years old.

436
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,987
[laughter]

437
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,406
I was in a hotel room in Pittsburgh

438
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,326
when I finally got the guts
to make it a little warmer.

439
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,410
[laughter]

440
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,663
I didn't sleep the whole night.

441
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,166
I was terrified my father
was going to burst in the door.

442
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,043
"Who touched the thermostat in here?"

443
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,127
[laughter]

444
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,300
"You know, I set it there for a reason."

445
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,551
[laughter]

446
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,636
Yes. Yes, sir.

447
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,721
[man] I recognize the bookends.

448
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,767
- Are they always here, or is that...
- No, I put them here. Those are mine.

449
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,561
That's a Superman.
You know, I love Superman.

450
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,021
So this is a...

451
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,315
This is Kal-El on Krypton.

452
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,818
You see that he's in there.
He's in the rocket.

453
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:34,321
And there's his dad, Jor-El,
and his mom, Lara.

454
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,615
And then he goes in the rocket,

455
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,117
and he lands...

456
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,576
Where does he land? Kansas?

457
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,744
- [man] Kansas.
- Kansas.

458
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,456
And there he is, and they have got
the little Superman baby... right there.

459
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,707
Yeah, those are mine.

460
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,585
- What else? What's that?
- [man] Whose books are those?

461
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,004
The books are a prop. They're fake books.

462
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,715
They're just props. This is show business.

463
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,884
I don't actually live here.
This is not a...

464
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,094
[laughter]

465
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,304
You need to get out a lot more.

466
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,645
I had every comedy album
and every comedy thing you could get.

467
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,273
I did a show with this puppet
when I was in third grade.

468
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:12,609
When I was a kid
and a comedian came on TV,

469
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,611
I would just freeze and stare at them.

470
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:17,781
Being obsessed with comedy
felt very liberating,

471
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,159
because it didn't have to do
with the real world.

472
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,703
You know, a Mad Magazine,

473
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,621
you would start reading it
and you're going,

474
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,790
"Well, these people
don't respect anything."

475
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,710
And that just exploded my head.

476
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,462
It was just, like,
you don't have to buy it.

477
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,965
You could say, "That's stupid."

478
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,592
"This is stupid."

479
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,140
Then, one day, my friend's older brother
told us there was this place in New York

480
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,393
where young guys were getting on stage
and doing stand-up comedy.

481
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,897
Not like the guys on Ed Sullivan
with tuxedos and cigars,

482
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,690
just young, crazy people.

483
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,027
Once I saw that this was going on,
that there was a world,

484
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,947
I went, "Oh, I want to be in that world.
I don't want to be in the real world."

485
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,618
So, I came into the city in 1976.

486
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,827
I told you that.

487
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,247
Uh... At that time, New York,
a little bit of a tough town.

488
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,042
Uh... But definitely the best place,

489
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,753
in my opinion, to become a comedian,

490
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,505
because, first of all,
everybody in New York is a little funny.

491
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,634
I'm sure you all think you're funny.

492
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,801
[laughter]

493
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,763
That's why you like comedy -
you feel you're pretty funny yourself.

494
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,307
You probably even think
you could do what I'm doing.

495
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,809
You think...
"I got interested in other things,"

496
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,354
but if I wanted to, I could have easily...

497
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,521
I could have done it.

498
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,482
"I chose not to."

499
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,858
[laughter and applause]

500
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,696
And that is a good place to learn comedy,

501
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,991
because in New York
you've got to really have something

502
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,993
to make audiences laugh.

503
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,162
And at that time, also,

504
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,289
New York wasn't doing so well as a city.

505
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,749
The city was going bankrupt.

506
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:55,212
It was also the same year that they built
the Roosevelt Island Tramway.

507
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,339
I used to say,
"Great, the city's going bankrupt.

508
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,007
They're putting up rides for us."

509
00:20:59,091 --> 00:20:59,967
[laughter]

510
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,136
"Maybe eventually we'll get
a rollercoaster in the South Bronx..."

511
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,305
which would be the first rollercoaster

512
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,558
"where people scream
on the flat part of the ride."

513
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,102
[laughter]

514
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,273
And that was my second joke
that I ever thought of.

515
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,607
[cheering and applause]

516
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,158
So I had the left bit, I had the tramway.

517
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,410
I was rolling.

518
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,788
And I lived in a little apartment
on the West Side,

519
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,081
and it was very small.

520
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,333
It was just 15-feet square.

521
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,418
[laughter]

522
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,713
That is not a joke. You know
that New York apartments are like that.

523
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:41,133
And I brought my little bed from my room

524
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,718
to sleep on.

525
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:44,636
That was all I had. I didn't care.

526
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,890
I- I wasn't planning on really
getting anywhere doing this, by the way.

527
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,101
I just loved it and I wanted to do it.

528
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,353
And so I lived in that apartment.

529
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:57,065
Since I couldn't afford to fix it
or anything, I would paint it a lot.

530
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,567
Every time I painted it, I thought,

531
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,403
"Well, gee,
now it's a little bit smaller."

532
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,116
And I realize it's just the thickness
of the paint, but it is coming in.

533
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,200
It's coming in.

534
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,327
[laughter]

535
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,121
Eventually, someone's going
to come to visit me, open the door,

536
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,332
there's just going to be
a white block with an eye.

537
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,499
[laughter]

538
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,544
They will go, "Wow! That guy
painted that place a little too much."

539
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,464
And uh...

540
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,175
So, no money.
We performed here for free, by the way.

541
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,343
Absolutely free.

542
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,886
And audiences were packing in.

543
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,929
Just like tonight,
they're packing in to see us.

544
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,640
In the '70s, we were the new hot thing -

545
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,518
stand-up comics,
young people doing this thing.

546
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,438
So I would come over here in the middle
of the day and make a hamburger.

547
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,564
They let us have food.

548
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:41,026
That was one good thing about the place -
they would let us have food and T-shirts,

549
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,819
so I wore a Comic Strip T-shirt.

550
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,655
I would come here in the afternoon,
make a hamburger,

551
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,326
and then I would have another one,
another hamburger at night.

552
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,287
And I was consuming
about 30 pounds of chopped meat a month.

553
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,205
[audience groans]

554
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,415
I was like a trained seal coming in here.

555
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,500
I was just...

556
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,502
Just feeding me, and I would come up,

557
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,712
and, just,
"Tramway, left bit, good night,"

558
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,255
and that was, you know, that was it.

559
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,757
[laughter]

560
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,803
Somebody gave me a shower radio
as a present for my apartment.

561
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,179
I could have used a couch.

562
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,389
Oh, shower radio, that's a nice gift.

563
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:15,519
No better place to dance than naked
on a slick surface next to a glass door.

564
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,728
[laughter]

565
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:21,441
But I still feel that comedy culture,

566
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,527
I'll call it, of New York City.

567
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,278
I feel that it's still here.

568
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,116
So, I'm at a light, and there's a guy
crossing in front of my car,

569
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,450
and then the light changed.

570
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,911
It was actually my turn to go.
They were in front of the car.

571
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:37,374
The New Yorkers, you know how they just
raise their elbows up to pretend?

572
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,458
[laughter]

573
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,796
Here's an impression of someone hurrying,

574
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,881
but they don't go any faster.

575
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,383
Same exact speed.

576
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,428
This is what it would look like
if I was hurrying, but I'm not.

577
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,472
I'm just going to raise my elbows...

578
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,226
and do the faux-courtesy jog.

579
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,310
[laughter]

580
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:01,773
Somebody gave me the finger...

581
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,776
on my way, which I don't care about.

582
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,737
I don't understand
even why the finger is the finger.

583
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,366
Someone picks one of their fingers,

584
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,450
they show it to me,

585
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,869
I'm supposed to feel bad.

586
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,953
[laughter]

587
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,833
Bad finger. This is a good finger, right?

588
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,917
[laughter]

589
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,712
I always try and remember,
if I get this finger,

590
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,673
I'm one finger away
from a compliment, so...

591
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,049
[laughter and applause]

592
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,467
...it's not that bad.

593
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,894
These street-cleaning trucks
in New York, as a point of...

594
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,646
What kind of street-theater
absurdity is this?

595
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,066
Does anybody think
these trucks are cleaning...

596
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,193
[laughter]

597
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,903
...the street?!

598
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,615
Do they think they're cleaning the street?

599
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:54,242
Are they just laughing
their asses off in front of...

600
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,746
"Hey, get all the parked cars
out of the way, everybody!"

601
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:58,830
[laughter]

602
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,875
"We've got to make a huge, loud,
annoying hissing sound,"

603
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,794
then leave a little piss-trail
of water out the back...

604
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,548
"to complete
our doing-absolutely-nothing process."

605
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,466
[laughter]

606
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,219
"Wait until you see Ninth Avenue
after we're done."

607
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,846
You're going to think
you're in an architect's rendering...

608
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:19,643
"...strolling through
a modern wonderland of the future."

609
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,605
If you're walking down the street
in New York and you step in gum,

610
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,441
and that gum stays on your shoe
for a couple of blocks,

611
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,817
whatever that gum picks up,

612
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,738
that's the only cleaning of anything
going on in New York City.

613
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,324
We're living in filth!

614
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,408
[laughter]

615
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,036
We don't even care, anyway!

616
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,332
A sentence never heard
in the history of New York City:

617
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:44,251
"Hey, why don't we get a new awning?"

618
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,335
[laughter]

619
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,921
[applause]

620
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,634
"We've got six pounds
of bird crap on this one,

621
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:56,721
12 rips, 11 places
where the metal frame is showing through."

622
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,015
"It would cost us 200 bucks.

623
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:02,018
It's only the entire appearance
of our whole business."

624
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,605
"I don't think it's a good idea."

625
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,773
I think it's better

626
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:10,485
as a way for us to silently express
how much we hate ourselves

627
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:13,196
"and the stupidity of people
that even come in here."

628
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,864
"Yeah, you're right. Let's leave it."

629
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:15,949
[laughter]

630
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,244
Just landed at LaGuardia last week.

631
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,829
Always uh... It's nice there.

632
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:22,622
I like uh... I like the ceiling height.

633
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,748
It's a very nice uh...

634
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,833
[laughter]

635
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,252
It could be lower,
but I think it's good. It's good.

636
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:31,756
Named after the ex-mayor of New York,
of course, Fiorello H. La Guardia.

637
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,302
And I imagine it was quite an exciting day
in his life when he got that news,

638
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,262
when they came into his office and said,

639
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:40,598
"Mayor, we've decided we're going
to name the new airport after you."

640
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:44,102
He went, "Really? Which one?"
They went, "LaGuardia, on Grand Central."

641
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,730
"Oh, right, right.
Yeah, I've been there a million times."

642
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,814
[laughter]

643
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,860
I go through customs. The guy asks me,
"I've got to go through the bags.

644
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,280
Do you have any alcohol, any plants?"
He actually says, "Any drugs?"

645
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,657
Is this an effective interrogation?

646
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,743
Is anybody going, "Bingo! You got me."

647
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:03,038
Oh, my God.
I didn't see that question coming."

648
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,205
[laughter]

649
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,582
"Twenty kilos right there.

650
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,335
You literally
just completely caught me off guard."

651
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,505
New York in the '70s
was a crime city, it was a cop city,

652
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,049
it was a newspaper city.

653
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,426
I always liked
that whatever goes on in the world,

654
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,012
it somehow exactly fits
the number of pages

655
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,056
that they're using in the paper that day.

656
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,016
They never run out of room.

657
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,810
They never have big blank spots
where nothing happened.

658
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,813
They must be, at the end, "Get that paper
out before something happens."

659
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,607
That was another perfect fit today.

660
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,900
"That was fantastic."

661
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,360
[laughter]

662
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:37,322
I like it when the cops catch somebody
and they hit them with the nightstick,

663
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,824
and they get them in the handcuffs,

664
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,534
and they use the chokehold on them.

665
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,912
But when they put them
in the back seat of the police car,

666
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,789
they always put their hand on his head.

667
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,750
"You don't want to hit your head
on that edge of the door."

668
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,379
"That really stings. It smarts, you know?

669
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,588
Be careful."

670
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,964
[laughter]

671
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,926
Why are these crooks and mass-murderer,

672
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,805
hijacker, psychopath people
covering their faces

673
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,390
when they're being hauled in?

674
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:07,727
What is this man's reputation that he's
got to worry about someone seeing him?

675
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,895
Is he speed dating?

676
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:11,898
Is he up for some corner-office promotion?

677
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,734
"Oh, if the people
on my sales team saw me..."

678
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,693
[laughter]

679
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,196
...hijacking Egypt Air 747

680
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,949
and throwing bodies out
onto the tarmac one by one,

681
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,076
"I'll never hear the end of that,
I'm telling you."

682
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:26,663
"They will needle me in that break room.
You have no idea."

683
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,376
When they invented the stun gun,
I wasn't quite sure what that was.

684
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,503
It seemed like a gun
that they zap you with it,

685
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:36,131
and you just go, "Oh, my God. I..."

686
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,215
[laughter]

687
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,466
"Are you OK?"
"No, I'm fine.

688
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,219
Actually, I'm just stunned
that you would even use that on me."

689
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,595
[laughter]

690
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,598
I wonder if you can adjust it
to just "taken aback"?

691
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,560
If you could turn it down
and just zap somebody, and they go...

692
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,395
"Wow."

693
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:51,479
[laughter]

694
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,609
"You all right?"
"No, I'm fine. Just..."

695
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,695
[laughter]

696
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,779
[applause]

697
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,699
"I'm a little taken aback."

698
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,623
When I was 21 years old, the idea of
becoming a comedian seemed impossible.

699
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:11,791
I was living at home.

700
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,043
I had a job a couple of blocks that way.

701
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:17,422
I was sledgehammering walls down
for $25 a day,

702
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:21,342
and I would sit here
and have my lunch every day.

703
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,888
And I remember thinking,
"Even if I'm not any good at it,"

704
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:28,683
if I could just make enough for a loaf
of bread a week, I could survive,

705
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,644
"and that would be
the greatest life I could have."

706
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,690
Did you ever notice there's an insult
on every roll of toilet paper?

707
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,984
Down at the bottom: "facial quality."

708
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,068
[audience laugh]

709
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,821
I don't like the insinuation.

710
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,157
What has my face got to do with this?

711
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,535
And, yes, there was heckling and bombing,

712
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,080
and someone once threw a glass at me
that shattered on stage.

713
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,167
I remember a couple of people
who were interested in a physical fight.

714
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,710
None of it bothered me.

715
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,003
I was in comedy,

716
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,630
and it just felt like heaven.

717
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:01,674
You know,
one of the big nights that I had here

718
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,720
was my parents
coming to see me do my show,

719
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,305
because I had never...

720
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:11,142
For whatever reason,
I was very embarrassed around my parents

721
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,813
to show them this part of my personality.

722
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:19,859
So when I started doing this, it was,
you know, a little strange to them,

723
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,488
you know, when I told them, "I think
I want to be a comedian," and they went...

724
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,572
"OK."

725
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,784
"You know,
you've never done anything funny."

726
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:28,868
[laughter]

727
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,415
And so, eventually, I brought them here,

728
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,084
and they sat right there.

729
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,253
And I was so nervous that night,

730
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,798
because I was showing them
this whole side of myself.

731
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:45,510
It was like my little gay-closet moment,
you know, where I had to say,

732
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,679
"Mom, Dad, I'm...

733
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,473
I don't know how to tell you this,
but I'm a funny person."

734
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,433
"And I..."

735
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:55,645
I don't want to be ashamed
of it any more, and...

736
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,897
"I want to lead a funny lifestyle now."

737
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,107
[laughter]

738
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,900
"I want to be with other funny people,

739
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,403
I want to have breakfast
at two in the afternoon."

740
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,487
[laughter]

741
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,614
And I was out.

742
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,283
[laughs]

743
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,745
And the other thing was uh...
meeting girls in the bar out there.

744
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,455
That was a new thing, too,

745
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:19,210
because comedians sometimes have a little
difficulty in normal social situations.

746
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,129
I can do this, for some reason,

747
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:25,174
and I always... always felt comfortable
doing what I'm doing right now.

748
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,968
I could talk to all of you,

749
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,845
but I can't talk to any of you.

750
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:29,929
[laughter]

751
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,391
I don't really understand that,

752
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,811
but I've talked to a lot of other
comedians that have a similar thing.

753
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,062
So when you...

754
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,607
Coming here and doing a show,

755
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,151
and then you go sit in the bar
and girls would talk to you.

756
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,236
And that was, like, unbelievable.

757
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,947
So that's why
we never went any place else.

758
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,198
[laughter]

759
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:52,785
Why would you not go
where someone might be able to see you do

760
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,164
the one thing that you can do
that's kind of cool?

761
00:31:56,664 --> 00:32:00,668
So I started having relationships
with women, observing them up close.

762
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,715
Uh... Especially their bathrooms -
fascinating little wonderlands.

763
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,676
I noticed that women need a large

764
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,304
and constant supply of cotton balls,

765
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,014
and men don't need any.

766
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,684
I've never had a cotton ball
in my entire life.

767
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,519
I've never bought one,

768
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,188
owned one, needed one.

769
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:23,232
I've never been in a situation
where I've thought to myself,

770
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,193
"I could use a cotton ball right now."

771
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,277
[laughter]

772
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,446
"I could certainly get out of this mess."

773
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:30,990
Women need them.

774
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,827
And they don't need one or two,
they need thousands every single day.

775
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,538
They buy beanbag chairs
filled with cotton balls -

776
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,041
two days later, they're all out,
they need more.

777
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,709
They're on their way back to the store.

778
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,712
The only time you ever see them
is in the bottom of a little wastebasket,

779
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,965
looking like they have had
a horrible experience.

780
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,216
[laughter]

781
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,885
Tortured, interrogated -
I don't know what you did to them.

782
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,179
Once, a woman left three cotton balls
over at my house.

783
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:54,681
It took me a year to use them up.

784
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,601
Put one on the kitchen floor for
cockroaches to think it's a tumbleweed,

785
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,395
go, "This is a dead town. Let's move on."

786
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,729
[laughter and applause]

787
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,066
Or I go to the doctor.

788
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,194
Before he gives you the shot, puts alcohol
on your arm with a cotton ball,

789
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,487
I bring one of mine.

790
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,949
He goes for his, I go,
"Maybe you could use this one."

791
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,158
[laughter]

792
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,162
Sometimes he would use it,
take a penny off on my bill.

793
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,791
Gives me the prescription,
I take that home, open up the bottle,

794
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,501
there's another cotton ball in there.

795
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,046
The cotton-ball syndicate
was always one step ahead.

796
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,131
[laughter]

797
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,843
But relationships contain tension.

798
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,761
That is unavoidable.

799
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,014
It's essential, it's eternal.

800
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,809
All relationships,
there's always a little agenda thing

801
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,978
not quite lining up...

802
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,730
between the two people, right?

803
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,940
And so every relationship
you're in in life,

804
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,316
there's going to be tension.

805
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,484
Just accept that.

806
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,070
You ask any friend
how their relationship is going,

807
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,406
touching their face
is the first thing they do.

808
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,366
"How is it going with Judy?"
"Not bad."

809
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,451
[laughter]

810
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,661
"Yeah, we're doing OK."

811
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,122
And the higher up on the face they go,

812
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,166
the worse the relationship is.

813
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,961
"I heard you're having some problems."
"We've got to work on a couple of things."

814
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:10,798
"I heard you might break up."
"Yeah, I can't go any higher on my head!"

815
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,883
[applause]

816
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,095
This is one of the things
it takes guys time to learn.

817
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,683
Especially you young guys who have
got it all going on in every other area.

818
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,518
But you've got to learn the flowers.

819
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:27,190
The power of flowers
takes a long time for men to understand.

820
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,943
To us, it seems,
you know, like a frivolous thing,

821
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,653
like an insignificant thing.

822
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,447
It is... This is key!

823
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,656
[laughter]

824
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,992
If there were no flowers,

825
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,787
Earth would be populated
by men and lesbians.

826
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,871
That would be it.

827
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,955
[laughter]

828
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,918
Women are with men to get flowers.

829
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,252
That's what they want.

830
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,546
Men don't want flowers.
Don't give a man flowers.

831
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,507
"Oh, I've got to take care of this now?"

832
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,591
[laughter]

833
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,428
"And what if they die? I guess
that's my fault? I'm the bad guy? Fine."

834
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,932
But a guy walking down the street
holding a bouquet of flowers,

835
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,183
he's the star of that street.

836
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,937
No other guy wants to be with a girl
on the same street as that guy.

837
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,439
Because you get that, "See?"

838
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,524
[laughter]

839
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,568
"That's what I'm talking about."

840
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,653
[laughter]

841
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,905
Because he's got flowers!

842
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,909
He could have a severed head in
the other hand, she doesn't notice that.

843
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,993
[laughter]

844
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,747
He was probably just defending himself.

845
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,832
[laughter]

846
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,128
That's why the florist is not really
set up right for what men need.

847
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,922
You just should walk in,
you tell them what you did wrong,

848
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:36,217
they give you the flowers for that,
and you just move right out the back.

849
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,720
They need to make up the,

850
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,807
"All right,
your brother's not an idiot" bouquet.

851
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,727
The, "Your career's
important, too" basket.

852
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,522
That would be helpful to men.

853
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,731
[laughter]

854
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,652
I got engaged when I was 29.
Didn't go through with it.

855
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,279
The date wasn't good for me.

856
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,655
[laughter]

857
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,781
Had to cancel.

858
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,285
No, it was one of those things.
You know, a lot of people go through that.

859
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,328
The word "engaged" is a very scary word.

860
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,123
I- I would change that
if I was in charge of that.

861
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:11,210
I don't know, women, or whoever
came up with that word, "engaged."

862
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,005
I just saw giant gears just going,

863
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,089
"Chunk!"

864
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:20,052
"Engaged," to me, I felt like I was on
the first hill of a rollercoaster, going,

865
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:23,097
"Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click."

866
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,348
"Boy, this thing goes high."

867
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,602
"Click, click, click." At the top,
they give you the ring and piece of cake.

868
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:29,061
[screams]

869
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,146
"We're married!"

870
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,898
[screams]

871
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,274
[laughter]

872
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,358
[chuckles]

873
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:39,697
Biggest step, I think, in relationships
is you decide to have a kid.

874
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,201
I think you get to a point where everybody
you know has pretty much caught onto you.

875
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,746
You need to create a new person
that doesn't know anything about you.

876
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:47,914
[laughter]

877
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,457
You need a relationship

878
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,460
where someone's impressed
you know where the spoons are.

879
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,544
[laughter]

880
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,671
Where to urinate.

881
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,592
But, of course, they mature,
become intelligent and leave the house.

882
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,010
That's why people get pets,

883
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,304
because dogs stay stupid.

884
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,388
[laughter]

885
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,806
They grow, they get older,

886
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,434
but they never catch on to anything.

887
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:09,727
Every time you come home,

888
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,479
he thinks it's amazing.

889
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,564
They go through the routine.

890
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,358
♪ He's back again! ♪

891
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,694
♪ It's that guy with the food
And the ball ♪

892
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,321
♪ It's the guy ♪

893
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,240
"How did you know which house I was in?"

894
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,283
[laughter and applause]

895
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,576
[chuckles]

896
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,288
And that's a tough thing
for a lot of humans.

897
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,458
They have a tough time making that leap.
"I'm going to have a kid."

898
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,336
I had a next-door neighbor
one time actually had a pet monkey.

899
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,420
[laughter]

900
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:40,967
A chimp. And I thought,
"Come on, man. You're so close."

901
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,260
[laughter]

902
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:46,180
I mean, if you need a pet
that can roller-skate and smoke cigars...

903
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,349
it's time to think about a family.

904
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,684
[laughter]

905
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,645
What about men? Men like things.

906
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,939
Building, fixing, working on things,

907
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,275
or being around other men
that are building,

908
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,902
fixing, or working on things.

909
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:03,072
If a man is in his driveway
working on something with tools,

910
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:07,076
every other man in the neighborhood
is magnetically drawn to this activity

911
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,786
by, like, some invisible force.

912
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,205
They just wander up like zombies.

913
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,708
They go up to the window,
they pull the drape back.

914
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,168
"I think Jim's
working on something over there."

915
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,129
"I better get over there."

916
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,213
[laughter]

917
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,718
They don't help the guy.
They just want to be in the area.

918
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,556
We want to be in the area
where work is being done.

919
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,349
We want to ask him dumb questions.

920
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:32,351
"What are you using,
a Phillips head there?"

921
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,688
"Yeah, that's a good screwdriver,
the Phillips."

922
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,772
[laughter]

923
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,109
You always want to hitch your pants
when you talk about tools.

924
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,444
[laughter]

925
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,654
But this is why,
when they have construction sites,

926
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,032
they have these
wood-panel fences around it,

927
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,909
just to keep the men out,
so they can get a day's work done.

928
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,287
They cut a little hole for us

929
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,165
so we can stick our head in
and see what the hell is going on.

930
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,960
"Is he using a Phillips?"
"Yeah, looks like a Phillips down there.

931
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,420
That's a good screwdriver."

932
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:00,504
[laughter]

933
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,970
This was the place
that uh... really gave us a home,

934
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,347
and we just...

935
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,349
locked onto it, you know?

936
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:15,394
For me,
it really felt very Long Island, in a way.

937
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,272
- [Jimmy] Oh?
- Because it wasn't cool, Manhattan.

938
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,648
So we fit right in.

939
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:21,650
Seven nights a week, we were here.

940
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,154
Seven nights a week, for months
and months and months at a time.

941
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:29,450
You would spend all day
getting ready for the sun to drop.

942
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,327
- Right, yeah.
- Right?

943
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,371
Until the sun dropped, we didn't exist.

944
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,872
Yeah, as soon as it got dark...

945
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,124
- [Mark] That's right.
- "My life is starting now."

946
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,753
And how about when you walked in this door

947
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,671
and all your friends are here?

948
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,216
- [Jimmy] Yeah.
- [Jerry] And there's an audience in there.

949
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,384
It was amazing.

950
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,720
To me, it was like high school
without the school part.

951
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,888
- [Jerry] Yes!
- You know?

952
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,016
And we were the...
the stars of the football team.

953
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,142
- That's right.
- Right?

954
00:39:55,226 --> 00:40:00,147
Which none of us
had ever experienced anything like that,

955
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,775
socially, in our lives,
prior to that moment.

956
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:08,531
You know, you had to be a dysfunctional
social person to confront this.

957
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,616
- You had to be desperate.
- Desperate.

958
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,575
Yeah.

959
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,660
[laughter]

960
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,120
What else would you like to know?

961
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,956
- We've covered many things.
- [man] What's wrong with the Mets?

962
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,417
Well, it's baseball,

963
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,751
and nobody cares.

964
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,253
[laughter and applause]

965
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,337
[cheering]

966
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:28,175
Here's the thing about sports
you've got to understand, sir.

967
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,637
This whole concept of the team -
your team, my team...

968
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,848
"Hey, that's our team.
The Mets, that's our team."

969
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,559
Really? Is it our team?
Who are these guys? Where are they from?

970
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:40,229
They're not from around here.
They're just paid to wear those clothes.

971
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:43,649
The uniform
is the only constant in the sport.

972
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,609
The guys are moving around,
different teams,

973
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,570
teams are moving from different towns.

974
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,738
We're really just rooting for our clothes

975
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,075
to defeat the clothes
from the team of the other city.

976
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:53,993
[applause]

977
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,786
That's what sports is.

978
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,539
We are rooting for laundry
and nothing else.

979
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,292
I always find it weird how upset we get

980
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:04,003
when a guy leaves your team
and then he plays against your team.

981
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,882
"Different shirt! I hate this guy!"

982
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,677
"I can't believe he's wearing that shirt!"

983
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,595
[laughter]

984
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,266
Everyone you see every day
is wearing a different shirt.

985
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,768
You don't get upset with them
for some reason. I don't know.

986
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,355
But I'm excited for the clothes
that you're wearing tonight.

987
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,816
Your clothes got out.
That's a big night for them, too.

988
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,693
Clothes are waiting all the time.

989
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:31,030
They're waiting in the store,
closet, hamper, drawer.

990
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,825
Everything you're not wearing now is home,
hoping to get picked tomorrow.

991
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:35,993
[laughter]

992
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,620
Laundry day is another exciting day.

993
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,747
The washing machine
is a nightclub for clothes.

994
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,458
It's dark, bubbles are happening,
they're all dancing.

995
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,460
They seem to kind of dance in there,
don't they?

996
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,921
The shirt grabs the underwear,
"Come on, babe, let's go."

997
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,632
You come by,
you open up the lid, they all freeze.

998
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:50,966
[laughter]

999
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,719
"Could you close the door, please?
It's kind of a private club."

1000
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,805
"There's a dress code,
no one's allowed to be on anything."

1001
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,890
[laughter]

1002
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:02,394
Now, things progressing along

1003
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,480
in little Jerry's comedy adventure.

1004
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,608
I got to a point
where I could afford a maid.

1005
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,902
The first time...
You remember these little firsts.

1006
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:13,572
I remember the first time I could afford
a maid, I felt so guilty the whole time.

1007
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,407
I was following her around the apartment.

1008
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,826
"I don't know why I left that there.
I'm sorry. I..."

1009
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,955
"Obviously I could have picked it up.
I should have."

1010
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,665
I just didn't, and I don't know why.

1011
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,501
"I have no excuse. I apologize for that."

1012
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,585
[laughter]

1013
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,797
This is why I could never be a maid,
because that's the attitude...

1014
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,841
I would walk in the house.
"Oh, I suppose you couldn't do this?"

1015
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,093
[laughter]

1016
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,596
"No, no, no. Let me clean up your filth...

1017
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,808
while you just sit there
like a subway rat with a trust fund."

1018
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,976
[laughter]

1019
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,978
"You make me sick!"

1020
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,774
Socks hate their lives, we know that.

1021
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,818
They're on the stinky feet,
the boring drawers.

1022
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,736
They wait for the laundry.

1023
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,322
That's their one chance to escape,
and they all know it.

1024
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,448
[laughter]

1025
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:58,742
How many times have you done a wash,

1026
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,703
go to the dryer, count up your socks,

1027
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:01,787
one of them got out?

1028
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:02,871
[laughter]

1029
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,124
Escaped, took off.
Never takes his partner!

1030
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,877
"To hell with you! Tired of everyone
thinking we're the same!"

1031
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:09,962
[laughter]

1032
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,008
The dryer door swings open, the sock
is always waiting up against the sidewall.

1033
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,634
[laughter]

1034
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,432
You're feeling around. "I know
he's in there, that little son of a bitch."

1035
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,309
I know he's trying to get away!"

1036
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,687
Sometimes they grab onto a sweater,
gives them a head start.

1037
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,439
[laughter]

1038
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,275
And off they go down the street.

1039
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,027
[hums tune]

1040
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,986
[laughter]

1041
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,196
What can he do?
How is he going to survive out there?

1042
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,325
On a golf club, puppet show, amputee.
What are the options?

1043
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,534
[laughter]

1044
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,495
Sometimes you see a dirty sock
on the street, just one.

1045
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,748
Just dirty, twisted, exhausted.

1046
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,126
He only made it a couple of blocks.

1047
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,210
[laughter]

1048
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,505
What about his partner left behind?

1049
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,715
What are his options?

1050
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,926
"Oh, now I'm going to get thrown out
because of him? How is that fair?"

1051
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,428
[laughter]

1052
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,723
"The whole drawer knew he was going
to pull a stunt like this someday."

1053
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,975
That's why he was always inside out
and rolling down.

1054
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,727
"He wasn't one of us to begin with."

1055
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:07,811
[laughter]

1056
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:13,275
So I told you
my parents came to see me here.

1057
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,654
They had already moved to Florida
by then, anyway.

1058
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,908
Um... They didn't want to move to Florida.
They got old and that's the law, so...

1059
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:21,992
[laughter]

1060
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,787
A little golf cart pulled up with a siren.

1061
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,705
"Let's go, pop.
White pants, belt and shoes."

1062
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,540
Get in the car.
I got it all ready for you.

1063
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,459
"You're out of here. This part's over."

1064
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,794
[laughter and applause]

1065
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,756
Visiting my parents in Florida in these...

1066
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,470
I don't get those minimum-security
prison places that they like down there.

1067
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:45,432
Little guard-gate booth at the front,
the thing comes down in front of your car,

1068
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,560
19-year-old kid in a phony cop uniform
comes running out.

1069
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,980
"Where the hell do you think you're going?
Your name is not on the list!"

1070
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,482
[laughter]

1071
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:55,484
"Dude, who is stealing the old people?"

1072
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,985
What's the...

1073
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,862
"What is the lockdown here?"

1074
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:00,697
"I got a granny! Let's go."

1075
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:01,782
[laughter]

1076
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,078
Go down there to visit your parents,

1077
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:09,415
end up in a hot tub with your father
and three or four really old men.

1078
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,374
[laughter]

1079
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,918
That's a perfect way
to meet elderly people, right?

1080
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,546
Half-naked,
sitting in tubs of hot bubbling water?

1081
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,382
They get out,
they look like an ad for gravity.

1082
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,466
[laughter]

1083
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:23,137
Why do these old guys love heat?

1084
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,931
Steam rooms, hot tubs, saunas, Jacuzzis.

1085
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,100
If they ever decide to land a man
on the sun,

1086
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,727
these old retired guys
would be able to handle it.

1087
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,730
No space suit,
just a towel, a pair of flip-flops.

1088
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,443
They will sit there on a wood bench,
with a washcloth on their head, going,

1089
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,694
"Close the door!"

1090
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,573
"Come on, in or out.
You're letting all the heat off the sun."

1091
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,657
[laughter]

1092
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,869
My mom is uh... still driving.

1093
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,579
Can't see a goddamn thing.

1094
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:49,663
[laughter]

1095
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,832
Don't you have to see to drive?

1096
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,709
Isn't that part of driving?

1097
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,463
I had her car fitted with
a cataract-lens windshield.

1098
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,881

1101
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,390
Everyone's head inside the car
looks huge now.

1102
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,475
[laughter]

1103
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:14,980
People think it's a car full of
sports mascots coming down the street.

1104
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,148
They don't know what it is.

1105
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,945
My dad would wait for me to come home
so that I could help him move furniture.

1106
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,031
This is his favorite bonding activity.

1107
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:26,992
I don't see him for three months.
"Give me a hand with this, would you?"

1108
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,370
"I haven't seen you in three months."
"Get the other end. Let's go."

1109
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,497
[laughter]

1110
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:36,168
My father's moving technique
was to pick up something incredibly heavy,

1111
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:37,544
get it in the air,

1112
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,214
and then he explains
what we're going to do with it.

1113
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,298
[laughter]

1114
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,635
He's always got a cigarette in his mouth,
burned to a quarter-of-an-inch long,

1115
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:46,053
the smoke going right in his eye.

1116
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,304
[laughter]

1117
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,640
Because you want your eye
blinking and tearing

1118
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,601
when you're going backwards
down a staircase, holding a wall unit.

1119
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,977
That's the easy way to do it.

1120
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,439
"Easy," that's his favorite word.
Lift it up. "All right, easy now.

1121
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,191
Easy, easy, easy."

1122
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,109
It's not easy, it's very difficult.

1123
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,069
[laughter]

1124
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:05,155
Why don't you say that?
"Difficult, difficult, difficult.

1125
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,158
Impossible, impossible, impossible.
Put it down, it's impossible."

1126
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,243
[laughter]

1127
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:10,744
[movie projector whirring]

1128
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,497
[Jerry] I try to put cigarettes
into my comedy as much as I can.

1129
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,873
I want to do those moves.

1130
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:15,958
[laughter]

1131
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,087
When I'm arguing with a smoker,
if they have the cigarette and I don't,

1132
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,171
they got me.

1133
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:22,339
[laughter]

1134
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,632
"You see what I'm saying?

1135
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,718
Because I have a cigarette and you
have nothing. This is what I'm saying."

1136
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:27,803
[laughter]

1137
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,098
"Your hands are empty.
My hands are busy all the time."

1138
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,182
[laughter]

1139
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:37,396
"And it's on fire. Does that bother you?
It doesn't bother me. I'm used to it."

1140
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,065
They put it out and the argument is over.

1141
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,734
When they put that cigarette out,
there's nothing more to add.

1142
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:43,777
[laughter]

1143
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,822
I'm standing there, "I think this.
I feel this. My point of view is this."

1144
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,574
They go, "That's your whole opinion?"

1145
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,492
[exhales]

1147
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,873
"It's out, you're wrong."

1148
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:57,958
[laughter]

1149
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,170
It was all about the material,

1150
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,964
the bits, the stuff.

1151
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,008
Rodney Dangerfield said to me,

1152
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,177
"The killers,
they're wanted in all 50 states."

1153
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,056
Minutes - comedians think in minutes.

1154
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,018
How many minutes do they want?
How many minutes do you have?

1155
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,561
How many minutes did you do?

1156
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:21,982
Any time I wrote something that worked,
I saved it in this accordion folder.

1157
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,192
Every single thing.

1158
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,194
And this is it,

1159
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,156
from 1975 until this morning.

1160
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,036
A lot of jobs I wouldn't want because
I don't like the attitude of the people.

1161
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:39,041
The notary public seems to be very
thrilled with their power and position.

1162
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,001
You go to the bank,
"I need this notarized."

1163
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,295
"Oh, the notary's not here.
You've got to wait."

1164
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:47,049
Only the notary can notarize -

1165
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:50,385
has the skill, the technique,
the background

1166
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,764
to take a stamper and go, "Boom, boom."

1167
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,223
[laughter]

1168
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,143
Sometimes I just want to take
that stamper, rip it out of his hands.

1169
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,479
"There, I have the power now!"

1170
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:03,398
"You see, he's just a man!"

1171
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:04,775
[laughter]

1172
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,694
How do they teach people to do that?

1173
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,113
Notary classes
where the teacher stands at the front?

1174
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,115
"OK, everyone, now, ready and..."

If it was a musical notary public school,

Thank you.

I don't like magicians.

1186
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,977
I've worked with many magicians in
my many years in the nightclub business.

1187
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,229
I don't like their attitude.

1188
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,356
A little full of themselves,
a little arrogant.

"I come on, I fool you,
you feel stupid, show's over."

[laughter]

1191
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,072
Never explain, you never understand.
That's how they do it.

1192
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,324
"Here's a quarter. Now it's gone.

[laughter]

1195
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:05,544
Craziest act I've ever seen was this guy
that could catch bullets in his teeth.

1196
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:08,422
It was kind of a circus act,
really, but it was real.

1197
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,424
I think it was real.
I don't really even know.

1198
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:11,800
But this guy would come out,

1199
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,010
they would shoot a gun at him,
he would go...

They throw it - throw it at you
a couple of times first, really hard.

to break into if you're a crook.

1211
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,707

"So fire away."

1216
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:59,765
To me, the worst part of the whole thing
is I saw this guy, I was amazed,

1217
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:00,849
and I have no idea...

1218
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,435
I don't know the name.
What's the name of the guy? I don't know.

1219
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,814
If he knew that, wouldn't he feel, like,
"What the hell do I have to do...

1220
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,193

1224
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,538
How do you think... People say,
"I think the President might be crazy."

1225

"Oh, yeah? So? Well, what do you expect?"

1226
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:29,461
Anybody who thinks
they should be the president,

1227
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,004
there's your test right there.

1228
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:35,467
If you actually think for real,
in your head, that you should be...

1229

You're out of your mind! You're crazy!

[laughter]

1231
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:41,264
"I should be the president,"
to me, is like,

1232
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,516
"I should be Thor."

You're out of your mind, OK?!

00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,360
or you do know, this is who they are, OK?

1253
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,987
I comprehend it.

1254
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:42,701
What I do not comprehend is how we
ended up with the elephant and the donkey

1255
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:45,745
as the two mascot animals

1256
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,373
for only two major political parties.

1257
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,042
You've got the whole animal kingdom here.

1258
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:54,462
You can pick from magnificent stallion,

1259
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:55,964
Bengal tiger.

1260
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,342
Democrats: "How about a jackass?"

1261
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:02,178
How about...
Why don't we be the jackasses?"

1262
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,556
"I like the jackass idea.

1263
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,685
Did everyone hear that?
The jackass is a very impressive animal."

1264
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,769
[laughter]

1265
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,732
"You don't think people will think that
we're jackasses if we pick a jackass?"

1266
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,817
"No, it's two completely separate things."

1267
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:16,943
[laughter]

1268
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,279
The Republicans go,
"If they're going jackasses,

1269
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,365
how about a smelly,
slow-witted circus animal? How about..."

1270
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,951
An elephant is certainly impressive

1271
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,955
when you weigh five tons wearing
the smallest possible hat you can get.

1272
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,040
[laughter]

1273
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,585
And you know, this is a true fact
about elephants in the circus.

1274
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,421
Before they go out to do their show,
they take a broom handle,

1275
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,465
they stick it up the elephant's ass

1276
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,800
so the elephant empties himself,

1277
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,678
because they don't want him to do it
during the show.

1278
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:47,140
"And I think that's also a good image
for our party.

1279
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:50,435
That says, 'We're willing to do
whatever we have to do.'"

1280
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,519
[laughter]

1281
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,201
"Pony."

1282
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:09,037
Oh, this is a thing about pony rides,

1283
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,082
that parents take kids on pony rides,

1284
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,918
and there's nothing else
that they could use ponies for

1285
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,212
except for rides for little kids.

1286
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,673
The cops don't use them for crowd control.

1287
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,341
This bit worked pretty good.

1288
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:24,594
And uh... so I would do the cop going,

1289
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:26,513
"You want to get back
behind the barricade."

1290
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,808
Yeah, this is pretty funny.
Definitely late '70s.

1291
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:35,438
To feel that your sense of humor
is actually being validated,

1292
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:40,068
that is the only validation I think I have
ever really cared about as a human being.

1293
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,404
But I didn't really care
whether they liked me or not.

1294
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,490
To me it was, like,
do they like the material?

1295
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,410
Do they like the jokes?
Do they like what I thought of?

1296
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,746
It's like, I'm not out here, "I need you
to... I wish you would like me."

1297
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:54,332
You know, if you like it, fine;
if you don't, that's fine, too.

1298
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,252
I'm about out of time here.

1299
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,628
Time is uh...

1300
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,756
I think one of the things
people lie about the most.

1301
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,758
Anything "20 minutes" is a lie.

1302
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,843
[laughter]

1303
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:08,680
Any time someone says, "I'll be there
in 20 minutes. It takes 20 minutes..."

1304
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,099
"You said 20 minutes."
"It was!"

1305
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,059
Nobody knows what 20 minutes is.

1306
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,855
If you want to lie, just say, "I'll be
20 minutes. I'll be there in 20 minutes."

1307
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:22,193
I saw an ad for a mattress store
a couple of months ago.

1308
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,112
"No payments until June,"

1309
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:28,908
because they know our idiot brain
is going to go, "Oh, June?"

1310
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,828
"Well, that's not really my problem,
then, is it?"

1311
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:32,954
[laughter]

1312
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:35,665
"It will probably never be June, anyway."

1313
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,293
"That's June guy's problem."

1314
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,210
[laughter]

1315
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,964
Same for when you're watching TV
late at night, right?

1316
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,883
And you're tired,

1317
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:48,845
and you're binge-watching
all your little Netflix shows,

1318
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,514
and you think I don't know
you're doing it right now.

1319
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,266
After you're done with me,

1320
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,936
you're going to go back to your little
show, maybe find out who the killer is.

1321
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,898
What about work tomorrow?
You've got to get up.

1322
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,692
"Oh, that's morning guy's problem."

1323
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,652
I'm night guy.

1324
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,738
Party rocks on for night guy.

1325
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:08,448
Fire up another episode,

1326
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,867
crack open another sleeve of Oreos.

1327
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,661
"No rules for night guy!"

1328
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:16,206
Then, the next morning,
the alarm goes off,

1329
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,666
you're trashed, crumbs in the bed.

1330
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,959
"Why did I do that?

1331
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,295
I hate you, night guy!"

1332
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,797
[laughter and applause]

1333
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,467
Because night guy...
Wait there's more. Because night guy...

1334
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,261
Night guy always screws morning guy.

1335
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,222
Nothing morning guy can do.

1336
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,140
He turns into coffee-all-day guy...

1337
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,935
who's then can't-sleep-at-night guy...

1338
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:41,397
totally-trashed-doesn't-do-his-work guy,
and out-of-a-job guy.

1339
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:43,441
Does night guy care? No.

1340
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:47,654
He's sleeping on a brand-new mattress,
courtesy of no-payments-until-June guy.

1341
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,988
[laughter and cheering]

1342
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:59,082
So, when you're doing stand-up comedy,

1343
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:03,378
you absolutely have to connect
with the audience.

1344
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,339
Not every other form of art is like that.

1345
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,757
A lot of movies I see,

1346
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,510
it doesn't seem like they care
if we can even follow the plot.

1347
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:13,263
I'm the kind of guy...
I have a lot of trouble

1348
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:15,640
with these movies like uh...

1349
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,851
Jason Bourne, Mission Impossible.

1350
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,687
I'm the guy you always see
in the parking lot after the movie,

1351
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,397
talking with his friends, going,

1352
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,775
"Oh, you mean,
that was the same guy from the beginning?"

1353
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:26,985
[laughter]

1354
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,028
"Oh!"

1355
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,823
That's why after he stole the money
he had the fake nose,

1356
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:32,991
beard, and then he didn't!

1357
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:35,827
"Oh!"

1358
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,036
"Did you enjoy the movie?"

1359
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,038
"Yes, I'm enjoying it here
in the parking lot,

1360
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,416
but in there,
I didn't know what the hell was going on."

1361
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,792
[laughter]

1362
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:47,088
Nobody will explain anything to you
in a movie theater once you get confused.

1363
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,174
[whispers] "What is happening now?"

1364
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,843
"Shh!"

1365
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,179
"Just pay attention."

1366
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:55,555
[laughter]

1367
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,765
"Why did they kill that guy?"

1368
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,518
"I thought he was with them."

1369
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,271
"They had to."

1370
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:04,355
[laughter]

1371
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,609
"I liked that guy. That was the..."

1372
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,945
"That's the only guy that I liked."

1373
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,781
"Would you just watch the movie?"

1374
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,576
"I am watching the movie."

1375
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,871
"I don't understand anything."

1376
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,625
"You know as much as I do!"

1377
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,043
[laughter]

1378
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:26,920
"I know nothing!"

1379
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,548
"Is this a space movie? Is it a Western?"

1380
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,426
"I am lost in this movie."

1381
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:36,554
"I hate this movie."

1382
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,639
[laughter]

1383
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,849
"And I hate you, too."

1384
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:40,934
[laughter]

1385
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:44,062
Why can't they have subtitles
for the plot?

1386
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:47,065
Closed-captioned for the movie-impaired.

1387
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:49,901
These are the movies I would go to.

1388
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:51,569
A little thing pops up.

1389
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,405
"Don't worry about this guy,
he's only in this one scene."

1390
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,490
[laughter]

1391
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:58,785
"Here's the name of the movie
you can't remember

1392
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,578
that you have seen this person in before."

1393
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:02,664
[laughter and applause]

1394
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,380
Anyway,

1395
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,049
the story that I wanted to tell you

1396
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:17,136
was if you ever wanted to know
how I did whatever I've done,

1397
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,514
it really all started here
at the Comic Strip.

1398
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:25,228
This was the place where I created all of
the material that I did for you tonight.

1399
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,813
[cheering and applause]

1400
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:33,611
And it's what got me from, you know,

1401
00:59:33,695 --> 00:59:35,863
open-mic Monday night - audition night,

1402
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,408
living at home with my parents,
in my little room,

1403
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:40,118
to, five years later,

1404
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,246
being on The Tonight Show on NBC,
