There's indications.

them for a week, they'll look fine.

my shirt or a sleeping bag?" It's huge!

But then when I put it on,
I'm like, "It's a little tight.

Where am I going, rollerblading?"

to give up on the belt hole.

a different purpose.

the illusion. That's just science.

That's why Santa Claus...
Santa's belt is like a conveyor belt.

91

It's not even holding up his pants.
It's keeping his jacket closed.

00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:38,898
And we're leaving cookies out
for that slob?

93
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:44,471
Of course,
Santa wears suspenders under his coat.

Suspenders,

Because eventually the gut gets so big,

00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:56,449
the pants need to be suspended...
like a bridge.

The belt no longer fits
across the equator.

It must be buckled underneath.

100

Instead of holding up the pants,
it drags them down.

an equal opposite reaction,

In winter, we discuss summer
with such reverence.

Summer's presented as a vacation.

It's like a three-month vacation
for nobody but children.

And who doesn't deserve a few months off
after the rigors of kindergarten?

There's a strange pressure
to travel during summer.

"Going somewhere this summer?"
"Why do I have to go somewhere?"

during the horrible weather.

And winter is some horrible weather,
right?

141
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,134
We're never ready for it.

142
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,770
We're never ready
for the seasons to change.

143
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:34,174
Even in October, we're caught off guard.
We're like, "It's getting cold.

144
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,143
What is this, every year now?"

[audience laughing]

146
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,083
We're not angry. In February,
people are angry about the weather.

We wanna blame someone.

It's that darn ObamaCare.

No ObamaCare,
it'd be 72 degrees out there."

151
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,470
There's always a couple guys
that don't care about the cold, right?

152
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,136
They're like, "What is it, two degrees
out there? That's nothing. I went golfing.

Don't you secretly want them to die?

157
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,652
Not all of them, but you watch
the news like, "Not one fatality, huh?"

158
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,323
But I should be used to it.
I'm from the Midwest.

00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,026
All the memories of my childhood,
it was always winter.

160
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,865
It was winter when I was walking
through slush past mounds of snow.

161
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,969
When I was in high school, I saw
a photograph of Siberia where Stalin

162
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:40,273
would send Russian prisoners.
It looked exactly like my hometown.

163
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,975
[audience laughing]

164
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:46,312
"Is that my bike? That's my bike!"

165
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:52,185
I asked my dad, I was like,
"Why do we live here? Why would you stay?"

166
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,387
And he's like, "Well, you know,
these severe winters,

167
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,789
they really make you appreciate summer."

168
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:01,127
It was at that point
that I realized he was an alcoholic.

169
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,896
[audience laughing]

170
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:06,299
"Oh, you're just drunk all the time."
"It's pretty warm for me always."

171
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:12,038
As a kid, I used to imagine people were
tricked to move to the Midwest.

172
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,974
They were on the East Coast
in a covered wagon 200 years ago.

173
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,776
Someone was like,
"Whoa. Where you going?"

174
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,145
"Oh, we're going out West.
We're gonna go out West."

175
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:22,815
"West, huh?
Have you thought of the Midwest?"

176
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,818
"Midwest?" "Yeah.
It's like the West, but it's closer.

177
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,353
[audience laughing]

178
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,089
Tell you what.
Do you like amber waves of grain?"

179
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,258
"Uh, no. I have celiac disease."

180
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,861
[audience laughing]

181
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,097
"How about lakes? Everyone likes lakes.
Lakes in the Midwest are good.

182
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,167
In fact, there are Great Lakes.
One of them's Superior."

183
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,104
"Uh, I'm not going there."

184
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:49,275
But I do love the Midwest.
Every Christmas, I go to Milwaukee.

185
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:50,476
[audience whooping]

186
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,079
[chuckles] I love telling
my friends in California

187
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,315
that I go to Wisconsin in December.

188
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:00,320
They're like,
"Oh, no, no. Don't go there."

189
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,289
I'm like,
"That's where my wife's family is from."

190
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,124
[gasps] "You should get a new wife."

191
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:07,160
[audience laughing]

192
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,432
All I do in Wisconsin is eat cheese.

193
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:17,170
I know it's a cliché, but in Wisconsin
it's like they're trying to get rid of it.

194
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,471
[audience laughing]

195
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,341
"Oh, hey, you want some cheese?"
"I just woke up."

196
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,842
"That's a yeah, right?"

197
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,877
[audience laughing]

198
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,246
Have you ever eaten
so much cheese you think:

199
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,349
"I may never use the bathroom again"?

200
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,417
[audience laughing]

201
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:35,054
People on the East Coast think that's
weird. In the Midwest, that's Monday.

202
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,990
[audience laughing]

203
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,091
But it's the weather.

204
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:40,493
That's why we eat the way we do,
we're just like:

205
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,395
[grunting]

206
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:43,930
"Ah, it's still winter.

207
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,832
[grunting]

208
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,800
It's summer, but I'm on a roll."

209
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,402
[grunting]

210
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,540
It's not always winter.
There's spring. People love spring.

211
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,242
That's a fun day.

212
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,879
[audience laughing]

213
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,981
What a lie spring is. Right?

214
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:04,050
[audience clapping and cheering]

215
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:10,256
I spend the entire spring
waiting for it to be spring.

216
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,558
You're like, "Is it spring?"
"No, it's snowing."

217
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,295
Next day. "Is it spring?"
"No, it's 90 degrees."

218
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:18,197
[audience laughing]

219
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,967
"I guess we missed
those tiny white flowers."

220
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,406
Fall, people love fall.
"It's my favorite season."

221
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,808
[audience laughing]

222
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,176
It's not a competition.

223
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:36,382
"My favorite season that I'm voting for
in <i>America's Next Top Season</i> is fall."

224
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:38,818
[audience laughing]

225
00:13:38,885 --> 00:13:41,587
People that love fall,
they go crazy for the foliage.

226
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:42,522
[gasps]

227
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:49,328
"The foliage! Let's drive by the foliage.

228
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,200
It's so beautiful the way the leaves die.

229
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,502
[audience laughing]

230
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,339
They're so pretty
right before they fall to their death."

231
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,111
We think it's beautiful.
It's the leaves' hospice.

232
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,280
[audience laughing]

233
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,883
It also helps that the leaves can't talk.

234
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,294
If they could talk, they'd be like:

235
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,120
[screaming]

236
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,889
"Get me chlorophyll!

237
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:24,163
Why are these people driving by
and smiling at me? You monsters!"

238
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,968
We're rather insensitive
to the leaves' tragedy.

239
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,038
They die, they fall to the ground.
We just rake them up.

240
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,175
"Kids, you wanna jump on this pile
of dead leaves?

241
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:39,979
No? All right.
I'll just light them on fire."

242
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,048
[audience laughing and clapping]

243
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:55,027
The poor leaves,
all they know is spring and summer.

244
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:57,897
And then in October, they're like,
"Where is everyone going?"

245
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,968
Early in November, you always see
a couple of leaves hanging on.

246
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:07,073
They're like, "I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it through winter.

247
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,009
Me and my buddy, Carl.
Right, Carl? Carl?"

248
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,545
[audience laughing]

249
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,049
The pine trees, they must resent
the attention the leaves get.

250
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:23,389
"Stupid leaves. Everyone's driving by
looking at the pretty leaves.

251
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,626
I didn't even bother get to know them.
After a couple months, they're dead.

252
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:30,530
Come December, you'll be climbing
a ladder and sticking a star on my head."

253
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,165
[audience laughing]

254
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,268
"Why would a pine tree sound
like it's from Brooklyn?

255
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,470
[audience laughing]

256
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,940
How many jokes
about seasons does this guy have?"

257
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:43,009
[audience laughing]

258
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,045
Speaking of foliage,
I have to tell you, last October,

259
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,148
I was in western Massachusetts
and they're very proud of their foliage.

260
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,217
They're like, "You see our foliage?"

261
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:56,022
"Uh, nice job.
Good work doing nothing."

262
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,959
And I was with a friend
and we drove by this schoolhouse,

263
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,295
and my friend was like,
"You see that schoolhouse?

264
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,598
That's the schoolhouse where
they wrote, 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.'"

265
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:08,501
I was like, "Am I supposed
to be impressed by that?"

266
00:16:08,568 --> 00:16:11,270
And he's like,
"Well, it is a national landmark."

267
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,573
And I'm like,
"Are people going, 'Come on, kids.

268
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,209
Let's go see where they wrote
the worst song ever'"?

269
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:20,980
But what I didn't realize is
that "Mary Had a Little Lamb,"

270
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:23,382
in its day, was a huge hit.

271
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,586
It was huge.
It was like their "Uptown Funk."

272
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,287
[audience laughing]

273
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:32,258
Which makes you wonder
what was going on in the 1830s.

274
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,028
"Have you heard that song,
'Mary Had a Little Lamb'?

275
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,498
It's the song of our generation.

276
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:44,737
It's so complex. It's about this girl,
Mary, who had a lamb that was little.

277
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:50,676
The song explains it better.
I'm not doing it justice."

278
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,546
My friend told me,
"That song's based on a true story."

279
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,715
I'm like, "Well, I hope so...

280
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:58,117
[audience laughing]

281
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,087
'cause that would be
the worst made-up story ever."

282
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,089
[audience laughing]

283
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,025
How bad were the other songs
of that era?

284
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:12,665
"Johnny Has a Little Small Pox."
"We'll All be Dead by 30."

285
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:18,170
And of course my favorite,
"Why Does Everyone Smell Like Poo?"

286
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:19,338
[audience laughing]

287
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,340
"Jim, don't do that."

288
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:28,681
I spent a couple weeks there, I stayed in
this really nice, like, bed and breakfast.

289
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:31,717
The woman that was running it,
every morning she would ask me:

290
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,419
"Are you gonna go hiking today?"

291
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:36,556
And all I could think was,
"Wow, this lady knows nothing about me."

292
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:38,190
[audience laughing]

293
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,693
Hiking not today or ever.

294
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,097
I wouldn't hike to escape the Nazis.

295
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,601
Like, if I was in that movie,
<i>Sound of Music,</i> and they're like:

296
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,103
"To avoid the Nazis,
head over those mountains."

297
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,207
I would have been, "Mountains?
Isn't there a basement I could hide in?

298
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,377
I mean, like a finished basement,
you know.

299
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,712
[audience laughing]

300
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,516
One with, like, a keg and an NFL
season pass, know what I'm talking about?"

301
00:18:05,384 --> 00:18:06,452
I've been hiking.

302
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:10,122
The first thing you notice
when you go hiking is it's a mistake.

303
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,424
[audience laughing]

304
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,793
"Oh, we're not walking
anywhere in particular.

305
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,630
There's nothing at the end of this trail.
There's no bar or restaurant.

306
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,801
Not even a vending machine.
We're just idiots."

307
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:26,172
There's always a moment when you go hiking
when you realize, "Oh, no.

308
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:31,711
Now we have to walk back.
There's no exit through the gift shop."

309
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,715
I wanna like hiking.
It's like horseback riding.

310
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:39,218
You wanna like it, then you get
on a horse, you're like, "That's right.

311
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:44,357
I'm not a 12-year-old girl.
Get me off this poor animal."

312
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,660
But hiking is huge. It's huge.

313
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:52,765
There's hiking clothing.
There's clothing for walking outside.

314
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,569
I thought all clothing was
for walking outside.

315
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:59,405
There's whole parts of the country.

316
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,608
The entire Pacific Northwest,
everyone's dressed like there could be

317
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,411
an impromptu hike
at a moment's notice.

318
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,448
"Well, I'm going for a coffee, but you
never know when a hike might break out.

319
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:10,850
[audience laughing]

320
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,655
So, I'll put on some sturdy shoes
and a breathable fleece."

321
00:19:15,721 --> 00:19:17,556
[audience laughing]

322
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,692
That joke was brought to you
by Patagonia.

323
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,761
[audience laughing]

324
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,702
We usually...
We usually hike with a friend, right?

325
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:34,874
And pretend you're in a Viagra commercial?
"How is your erectile dysfunction?"

326
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:39,879
There's always that solo hiker that
looks like they just got rid of a body.

327
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,514
[audience laughing]

328
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:46,285
"Is that guy with someone?
Why is he carrying a garbage bag?

329
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,554
Is that Dexter?

330
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,558
Why'd you ask me
to walk in the woods?"

331
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:58,197
But it's not just walking. Hiking involves
an unnecessary amount of climbing.

332
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,432
"You wanna climb up here?"

333
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:05,204
No, I don't wanna climb up there.
I'm an adult. I have a driver's license.

334
00:20:05,271 --> 00:20:06,772
[audience laughing]

335
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,509
I don't like climbing.
I don't like climbing into an SUV.

336
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,947
You know that final step up,
I'm always like, "Is this worth it?

337
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,716
[audience laughing]

338
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:21,287
Why can't you have a normal car?
What are we, going on a safari?

339
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:27,727
I better see a damn elephant
if I'm climbing into your gas guzzler."

340
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:30,362
But once you get in an SUV,

341
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:36,368
you're always like,
"Oh, yeah. Let's invade Iraq.

342
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:39,371
- [audience laughing]
- Out of my way."

343
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:43,409
'Cause everyone turns into a jerk
in an SUV like, "I don't need a blinker."

344
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,681
Remember 15 years ago when they were
like, "Stop buying SUVs, everyone.

345
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,016
They're wasteful
and bad for the environment."

346
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:55,287
And we were like,
"Okay. I'd like to buy an SUV."

347
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,756
[audience laughing]

348
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,959
"No, I have a reason." "I don't care."

349
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,894
[audience laughing]

350
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:05,631
I don't own an SUV. I don't even own
a car 'cause I'm a good person.

351
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:09,268
No. I live in New York City
and I have five kids,

352
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,270
so I just have them carry me around.

353
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:14,039
[audience laughing]

354
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:18,577
I know nothing about cars. I come
from a car family. My dad loved cars.

355
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:22,548
My brothers loved cars. They talk
about cars. They go to car shows.

356
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:26,519
My brothers pay to look at cars
they will never drive.

357
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,888
And I thought strip clubs were weird.

358
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,290
[audience laughing]

359
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:35,060
Most of the accessories are wasted.
I mean, I've never used cruise control.

360
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:38,297
The heated seats,
I always feel like I just wet myself.

361
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:39,498
[audience laughing]

362
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:42,635
"Oh, this is nice.
Can we swing by the emergency room?

363
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,572
I think this is also
a symptom of a stroke."

364
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,974
[audience laughing]

365
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,577
When I go home to Indiana,
I always rent a car.

366
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,855
My brother Mitch is like,
"What kind of car you renting?"

367
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,581
I'm like, "It's blue."

368
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,016
[audience laughing]

369
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,885
"Is that four or six cylinders?"
"Blue."

370
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,321
[audience laughing]

371
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:06,325
I do know that the most manly form
of transportation is a pickup truck

372
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:09,929
'cause my brother Mike has
a pickup truck and he's a real man.

373
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,732
And at this point, pickup truck
commercials give me anxiety.

374
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:18,470
They're all like, "You can tow one ton.
You can tow two tons.

375
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,739
You can tow an aircraft carrier."

376
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,577
- Why?
- [audience laughing]

377
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,646
Why would you need that?
I only see you going to Cracker Barrel.

378
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,082
[audience laughing]

379
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,357
But people that drive pickups,

380
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:40,893
they wanna be associated
with the work ethic.

381
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,896
And based on that,
I should drive a bread truck.

382
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,365
[audience laughing]

383
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,767
I was with my brother
in a plant nursery, I was like:

384
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,837
"If I buy a small tree,
can I put it in the back of your truck?"

385
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,006
And he's like,
"No. You'll get the bed dirty."

386
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:58,077
And I realized something. Everyone
I know who owns a pickup truck

387
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,479
is not picking anything up.

388
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,814
[audience laughing]

389
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,950
It's like walking around
with a big, empty suitcase.

390
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,019
[audience laughing]

391
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:09,788
"Are you going on a trip?"

392
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:12,524
"No, but I'm the type of guy who would."

393
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:13,892
[audience laughing]

394
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:18,731
"Ram tough. Ram tough."

395
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,670
Thank you to everyone who watched
<i>The Jim Gaffigan Show</i>, by the way.

396
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,739
- I appreciate it.
- [audience cheering]

397
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:33,579
And if you didn't watch,
that just means you're a jerk.

398
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:38,717
But, no, but thank you if you did watch,
'cause there are so many television shows

399
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,855
and episodes of television shows
we could and should be watching.

400
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,457
It's amazing any of us
are here right now.

401
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:49,528
It's kind of overwhelming,
DVR, on-demand.

402
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,698
Sometimes I open my Netflix,
I'm like, "I don't think I can do it.

403
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,901
I'm not even gonna make a dent here."

404
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,604
And I know there's pressure.

405
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:02,574
We all feel it, 'cause we developed
excuses for our friends,

406
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,610
like we're dealing with debt collectors.

407
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,612
"You watch <i>Game of Thrones?"</i>

408
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,113
"I'm a little behind.

409
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,649
[audience laughing]

410
00:24:10,716 --> 00:24:13,919
Give me a week.
My wife had a dumb baby."

411
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,587
[audience laughing]

412
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:18,524
And it's never-ending.

413
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,694
"You finished that show? Now you have
to watch this show and then..."

414
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,862
"No, now I need to learn
how to read again.

415
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,597
[audience laughing]

416
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:30,569
I need to sound out some words
and see if I can read."

417
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,172
Have you read a physical book lately?

418
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,141
Not on a tablet or a laptop,
an actual book?

419
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,077
You feel like you're Abe Lincoln.

420
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,947
"Oh, it's made of wood.
Hope it doesn't catch on fire.

421
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:43,182
[audience laughing]

422
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,751
When does this have
to be back at the museum?"

423
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,754
'Cause we're all binge-watching.

424
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:51,223
When they first introduced
the idea of binge-watching,

425
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,125
I was like, "How pathetic.

426
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:56,795
I'm just gonna watch an episode or two.
I haven't showered in a week?

427
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,263
[audience laughing]

428
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:02,935
I'm a grandfather?
I missed my own funeral?"

429
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,839
I binge-watch shows I don't even like.

430
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:09,742
"This is pretty bad.
I guess I'll watch five more episodes."

431
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:11,243
[audience laughing]

432
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,848
I watched every episode of<i> True Blood</i>
and I'm not even gay.

433
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:18,016
[audience laughing]

434
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,920
Some of you are like, "Jim, watching
<i>True Blood</i> doesn't mean you're gay."

435
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,222
That's 'cause you're gay.

436
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:24,990
[audience laughing]

437
00:25:25,057 --> 00:25:27,259
It's the number one cause of gayness.

438
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:31,930
My friends don't understand.
"When do you watch? You have five kids."

439
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:38,937
I ignore them. I can't go to that recital.
I'm re-watching <i>West Wing</i>.

440
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,672
[audience laughing]

441
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:43,008
It's embarrassing
how I consume television.

442
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,943
There are nights when I've told myself:

443
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,880
"All right. One more season... [chuckling]

444
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,949
then I'm going to bed.
I mean, come on."

445
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:56,155
It's hard to stop. You see the ending.
You want the accomplishment. Right?

446
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,024
"Oh, you ran a 10K?
Yeah, I finished <i>Mad Men.</i>

447
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,759
[audience laughing]

448
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,828
I did it. I'm a little sore, but I did it.

449
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,964
I'm a television athlete.
I'm a telathlete."

450
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,003
It's strange when you get done
watching an entire series.

451
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,172
You don't know
what to do with yourself.

452
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,141
"I haven't been this lost
since the ending of <i>Lost</i>.

453
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:21,079
Should I go to a bar? I don't know
if I remember how to talk to people."

454
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,648
[audience laughing]

455
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,152
And starting a new show,
that's kind of like a blind date. Right?

456
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:33,826
"Well, my friend said you were great.
I'm free tonight, so...

457
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,930
I think I'm ready
to put myself back out there."

458
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:39,264
[audience laughing]

459
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,301
'Cause we have relationships
with these television shows.

460
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:43,869
You ever break up with a show?

461
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,672
You watch a bunch of episodes
and then you're like, "It's over.

462
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:54,012
I don't even know you anymore.
I gave up the best nights of my life."

463
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:58,050
Netflix. They won't let you forget your
mistakes. They keep them in your queue.

464
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,352
"Remember this relationship?"

465
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:06,191
"I was drunk. I was on the rebound."

466
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:09,094
They'll make suggestions,
"Since you enjoyed <i>True Blood</i>,

467
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:10,896
here's some other gay shows."

468
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,965
[audience laughing]

469
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:17,169
"Maybe I would like <i>The L Word</i>,
I don't know."

470
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:21,240
Netflix has definitely
made watching television

471
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,275
with commercials kind of painful.

472
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:26,912
Takes forever. You're like,
"What am I, growing my own food here?

473
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,280
[audience laughing]

474
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:31,049
All right, Geico, we get it!"

475
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,287
And it's not just the length
or the number of the commercials,

476
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,956
it's what the commercials say
about the typical viewer

477
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,825
of the show you're watching.

478
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,995
"Catheter? Why would...?

479
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,365
Reverse mortgage?

480
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:48,200
[audience laughing]

481
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:51,069
Back pain? [gasps] I do have back pain.

482
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:53,305
[audience laughing]

483
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:56,441
You know me so well, television show."

484
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,713
I watch a lot of cable news
'cause I enjoy being depressed.

485
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,283
That's the only reason to watch.

486
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,852
After five minutes,
they repeat the same stories.

487
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,955
"Remember that horrible thing?
Wait till we show you 20 more times.

488
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,691
You won't be able to sleep."

489
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:17,129
I think it's interesting how all
the cable newscasters are very attractive.

490
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,299
They're very attractive
and they're dressed up. I don't know why.

491
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,334
You know,
you're talking about a hurricane.

492
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:24,336
What's with the evening gown?

493
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:28,340
But we all kind of watch like,
"Thanks for showing some leg."

494
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,410
Cable newscasters are so attractive.

495
00:28:31,476 --> 00:28:35,147
When they interview a regular person,
it's visually distracting.

496
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,150
Like, "Is that a bad guy?

497
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,252
[audience laughing]

498
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,322
Or a victim? I know
they're a loser in this scenario, but..."

499
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,257
[audience laughing]

500
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:49,127
But the newscasters,
those are our town gossips. Right?

501
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:51,196
That's what newscasters are.
Town gossips.

502
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,966
"You're not gonna believe
what happened to this person

503
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:58,904
you've never met before.
Isn't that sad?

504
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,473
By the way, there's some weird stuff
going on in England.

505
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,660
I have a friend, John, over there.
John, why don't you tell them about it?

506
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:06,378
[audience laughing]

507
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:11,483
Thanks, John. Isn't that horrible?
By the way, it's gonna rain tomorrow.

508
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:16,888
I'm, like, 99 percent positive
it's gonna rain, and that's sad."

509
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,827
Most of my friends under the age of 30
don't even have cable.

510
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:25,163
I'm like, "Where do you send
your $500 a month?"

511
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,232
[audience laughing]

512
00:29:35,007 --> 00:29:37,342
It's getting to be embarrassing
to have cable. Right?

513
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:43,181
"You have cable?"
"I'm getting rid of it... when I die."

514
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,117
[audience laughing]

515
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,286
Technology is moving so fast.

516
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,855
There's times
when you feel like you're on top of it

517
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,991
and then there's times when you feel like
that friend with the flip phone.

518
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:56,828
We all have the friend or relative
with the flip phone.

519
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:02,534
You're like, "Where'd you get that?
Do you use that to call the past?

520
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,970
[audience laughing]

521
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:07,806
What character were you
on <i>Breaking Bad?"</i>

522
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,374
[audience laughing]

523
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:12,311
But there's definitely moments
when I'm the person with a flip phone.

524
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:16,381
Like, I have a landline. Some of you
are like, "What's a landline?" [chuckles]

525
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,451
No one wants to admit
they have a landline.

526
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:22,521
It's like discovering
you're still paying for AOL.

527
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:24,589
[audience laughing]

528
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:28,126
Here's how I justify having a landline.

529
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:31,830
I'm like, "Well, I need a landline
in case all the cell towers go out

530
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,865
and then I could call no one."

531
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,934
[audience laughing]

532
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:44,576
Our landline will ring,
our landline will ring,

533
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,279
my wife and I,
we won't even move to answer it.

534
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:54,086
"Well, it's obviously not for us.
No one we know has that number."

535
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,423
It's like paying a stranger
10 bucks a month to interrupt dinner.

536
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,092
[audience laughing]

537
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,160
By the way,
I know nobody's phone number.

538
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,896
I don't even know
my own wife's phone number.

539
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:09,067
If I was arrested and allowed one call,
I'd be like, "I don't know, 911."

540
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:11,470
[audience laughing and clapping]

541
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,877
I do miss slamming down
the landline when I was angry.

542
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,104
You know, like, "You can go to hell."
[mimics thudding]

543
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,150
You can't do that with a cell phone.
"You can go to hell."

544
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,118
Ugh.

545
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,186
[audience laughing and clapping]

546
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,657
Don't want that to fall
in the toilet. [chuckles]

547
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:42,134
Woke up today at 7 a.m.
Got out of bed around 1:30.

548
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,902
[audience laughing]

549
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:47,939
'Cause I need a good reason
to get out of bed, like fire.

550
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:51,042
That won't even get me out of bed.

551
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,913
One time I was in a hotel, the fire alarm
went off. I didn't even get out of bed.

552
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,915
I was like, "That's a test.

553
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:59,217
[audience laughing]

554
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,420
I'd bet my life that's a test."

555
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:03,121
[audience laughing]

556
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:08,660
I don't understand the morning people.
"Even on my day off, I'll get up at 6."

557
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,430
We should be able to hit these people.

558
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,532
[audience laughing]

559
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,699
I'm jealous.

560
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:20,472
Yes. Hatred. Applaud hatred. [chuckles]

561
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,541
But in reality, I'm jealous.

562
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,710
I mean, you have to understand,
my role models were the grandparents

563
00:32:25,977 --> 00:32:28,280
in that movie
<i>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.</i>

564
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,348
[audience laughing]

565
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,024
I remember watching that movie
as a kid and seeing the scene

566
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,059
with the grandparents in bed
and thinking:

567
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:46,264
"I like these people.
I like what they're all about."

568
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:52,003
They were in bed full-time.
What if we did this till we die?

569
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,207
They weren't even watching television.

570
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,476
They were looking
at the other grandparents.

571
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,313
"How's your bed?" "It's good. It's good.
It's the same as your bed."

572
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,417
They were so in the bed.
They lived in poverty.

573
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:10,355
Their grandson got a golden ticket where
he could win an entire chocolate factory

574
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:13,158
and only one of the grandparents
got out of bed.

575
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,227
[audience laughing]

576
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:19,064
The other three were like,
"Good luck, Charlie.

577
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,632
[audience laughing]

578
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:24,302
You win the factory and make me
a chocolate bed." [grunting]

579
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,776
Typically, I have to get up early
'cause I have young children

580
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:35,113
and they wanna
experience things like life.

581
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,451
"What are we doing today?"
"Well, I was hoping to nap."

582
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,021
"Can we go outside?"
"It's closed."

583
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:45,090
[audience laughing and clapping]

584
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,429
During the summer,
I tour with my kids

585
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,632
and we'll do, like, a kid activity
during the day

586
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,333
and then I'll do a show at night,

587
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,270
and usually the kid activity's
like a zoo or a park.

588
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:02,173
When we were in Erie, Pennsylvania,
we went on a pirate boat ride,

589
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,110
which was pretty authentic,
'cause when I think of Lake Erie,

590
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:11,683
I think of all them pirates storming
the shores of western Pennsylvania.

591
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,418
[audience laughing]

592
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:16,388
There were like 50 kids
and they were all dressed like pirates.

593
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,224
I felt like I was
at a children's Jimmy Buffet concert.

594
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,126
[audience laughing]

595
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:25,163
And I tell you, those kids were having
the time of their lives.

596
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:28,433
Kids love to dress like pirates.

597
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,237
The murderers and rapists
that pirates were.

598
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:33,805
[audience laughing]

599
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:37,208
And we think it's adorable.
"It's so cute.

600
00:34:37,275 --> 00:34:41,146
He looks just like one of those sociopaths
who terrorized the Caribbean."

601
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,081
[audience laughing]

602
00:34:43,148 --> 00:34:46,217
We let our kids dress like murderers.

603
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:51,790
Darth Vader,
that genocidal lunatic. It's fun.

604
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,660
The devil. It's cute.

605
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,829
Hitler. No.

606
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,265
[audience laughing]

607
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,371
No parent wants to explain that one.

608
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:09,140
"Why is your boy dressed like Hitler?"

609
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:12,210
"He's fascinated with the Third Reich.

610
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:14,112
[audience laughing]

611
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:19,684
He gets it from his father.
His father's man cave is all Hitler swag."

612
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,724
Summertime we went
to a bunch of fairs.

613
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,660
It's amazing how your perspective
on fairs changes.

614
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:32,163
'Cause as a kid,
you're like, "The fair! There's a fair!"

615
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,799
As an adult, you're like,
"That looks dangerous.

616
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,768
[audience laughing]

617
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:38,803
Are they cooking in that truck?"

618
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,172
[audience laughing]

619
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,509
We used to go to the fair to see
the biggest pig in the county.

620
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,746
Now we go to the fair
to be the biggest pig in the county.

621
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:52,517
Some of that food at fairs,
it's ridiculous.

622
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,821
Deep-fried Oreos, okay.
Deep-fried Twinkies, maybe.

623
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,923
Deep-fried butter, no.

624
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,859
[audience laughing]

625
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:03,595
"You know how occasionally
you'll eat a stick of butter?

626
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,230
What if we deep-fried it?"

627
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:10,602
No. It's wrong.
I mean, it's delicious...

628
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,570
[audience laughing]

629
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,905
but it's wrong.

630
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,777
There's no health inspector.
That's why they do that.

631
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,812
Everything at the fair is very temporary.

632
00:36:20,879 --> 00:36:23,715
Meaning, when the cops come,
they can leave.

633
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:29,454
Some of those rides don't look safe.
I'll just let my kids go first.

634
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,922
[audience laughing]

635
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,924
No sense in us all dying.

636
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,294
But you never wanna be judgmental
at the fair.

637
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,830
You're always like,
"You know what, I'm sure this ride's fine.

638
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:40,198
You know? I'm sure.

639
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,234
I'm sure the guy running the ride,
he's probably a structural engineer.

640
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:44,903
[audience laughing]

641
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,373
We don't know. That's probably
how he lost his arm, you know?"

642
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,747
'Cause inherently we're trusting.
We're very trusting of elevators.

643
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,783
We're like, "What is this,
a casket on a string? Let's hop on.

644
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,785
[audience laughing]

645
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:04,389
I don't know how it works, but
if it shakes, we'll giggle." [chuckles]

646
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:07,792
We giggle 'cause we realize
no one's driving the elevator.

647
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,528
[chuckling]
We're like, "We're all gonna die."

648
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:15,266
So, we press one of these buttons or climb
through the trap door in the ceiling

649
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,770
that leads to every Bruce Willis movie.
What do we do? [chuckles]

650
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,440
We also giggle 'cause there's
no talking on an elevator, right?

651
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:23,775
You get on an empty elevator,

652
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:26,811
you and a friend,
and you're like, "I'll tell you later."

653
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:31,349
It's like a den of awkwardness.
You just stand there like:

654
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,518
"Are we supposed to kiss?
What are we doing?"

655
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:38,690
It's very strange.
Not as awkward as a stairwell.

656
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:41,025
You ever been in an abandoned stairwell
by yourself

657
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,595
and you encounter strangers
coming the other way?

658
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:46,297
There's always that moment
where you meet eyes, you're like:

659
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,366
"If you don't rape me,
I won't rape you."

660
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:49,667
[audience laughing]

661
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,504
"What are you doing...?"

662
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,540
"What am I doing in...?
Are we in an episode of <i>Law & Order?"</i>

663
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,308
[audience laughing]

664
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,979
But we volunteer
for these awkward situations.

665
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:04,816
Sometimes we pay to participate.
Like water parks.

666
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,418
Those are fun, but there's always
that moment you're like:

667
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,655
"Is this a meeting of people
I don't wanna see in swimsuits?"

668
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:15,894
'Cause there are people walking
around water parks with that confidence

669
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,629
that they shouldn't have.

670
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,464
[audience laughing]

671
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:23,935
And you almost admire it.
You're like, "You go... away from me."

672
00:38:24,002 --> 00:38:25,603
[audience laughing]

673
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,505
You try and figure it out.
You're like:

674
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:31,776
"Is it the fumes from the toxic chemicals
combined with the children's urine?

675
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:36,347
What gives you that swagger
that would make Beyoncé blush?"

676
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,983
But you don't wanna be judgmental.

677
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,786
You're like, "You know what?
They're there for their kids.

678
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:45,356
I'm here for my kids and compared
to them, I look like Magic Mike."

679
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:48,593
So, God bless them. [chuckles]

680
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,466
My 3-year-old didn't get me
a birthday present this year. Yeah.

681
00:38:55,533 --> 00:39:00,104
And I've known him for a couple years.
So, I'm not talking to him.

682
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:05,009
Presents are interesting.
I don't really need or want anything.

683
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,913
I mean, my life is pretty chaotic.
I have five kids. You know?

684
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,582
I have friends that love stuff.

685
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,650
I have a friend
who has a drawer of watches.

686
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:15,053
I have another friend who has five cars.

687
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,022
And whenever I'm with these people,
I realize, I'm just simple.

688
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,393
All I need is a nice bed
and a private jet, you know?

689
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,130
Now, I have the bed.
All I need is the jet.

690
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:29,500
And it could be a used jet.
I'm not a snob, you know?

691
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,870
I mean, I don't want a prop plane.
I'm not trash.

692
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:37,141
Just a regular old private jet
to take a regular old guy to a regular old

693
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,510
private island away from his kids.

694
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,882
You know? I'm just salt of the earth.
I'm an everyman... [chuckles]

695
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:45,850
[audience laughing]

696
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:49,020
That's ridiculous. This year has flown by.

697
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,923
I don't wanna brag,
but I've kept my New Year's resolution.

698
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:56,561
I've done it. I've had pasta
every day this year. Thank you.

699
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:59,063
[audience clapping]

700
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,534
I tell you. It wasn't easy.
It wasn't easy.

701
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:06,604
There were some nights
when I was like, "Oh, my gosh. It's 11:30.

702
00:40:06,671 --> 00:40:10,742
I haven't eaten pasta. I have to wake
my wife up and have her make me some."

703
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:12,477
You know?

704
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,480
But I do it
'cause it's about personal accountability.

705
00:40:15,546 --> 00:40:16,848
[audience laughing]

706
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,618
By the way, if you believe I would wake
my wife up, you're drunk. All right?

707
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:23,554
'Cause I'm afraid of her, all right?

708
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,890
But I like being married
to a strong woman. I do.

709
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,826
I'm sure there are men in the audience
looking at their wives:

710
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:32,964
"Honey, do you want me to clap or,
you know, do you like what he's saying?

711
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:37,502
'Cause I'm on your side. I just don't
wanna talk about it later on."

712
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:39,003
[audience laughing]

713
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,739
I do like being married
to a strong, decisive woman.

714
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,208
But you know what?
I'm in charge of the remote control.

715
00:40:44,475 --> 00:40:46,144
That's where I draw the line, all right?

716
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,546
I'm in charge of the remote
'cause I'm the man.

717
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,649
I mean, she picks all the shows we watch,
but I get to hold the remote.

718
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,117
[audience laughing]

719
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,487
'Cause that's the kind of puppet dictator
that I am. [chuckles]

720
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,559
Being in charge of the remote control is
a no-win situation anyway.

721
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,128
The person you're watching with
is never satisfied.

722
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,597
They're like,
"Turn it up. I can't hear it."

723
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:08,866
Then you turn it up
and the commercial comes on.

724
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:11,135
"Turn it down.
What's wrong with your hearing?"

725
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,008
I'm always in trouble
when we watch television.

726
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,477
"Stop crinkling that bag."

727
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,947
Once I got in trouble for sneezing.

728
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:25,984
"Why would you do that?"

729
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,719
[audience laughing]

730
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,721
"I think it's involuntary."

731
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,224
"Well, now I didn't hear
what that guy said."

732
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:37,562
"All right. I'll rewind it. Oh, now it's
starting the whole episode over.

733
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,097
[audience laughing]

734
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,499
Here, you should be
in charge of the remote.

735
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,902
I'm gonna go back
to hiding in the bathroom.

736
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,672
'Cause I'm a man!"

737
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,807
[audience laughing]

738
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:52,977
I do love her. She can be demanding.
Like, unrealistic demands.

739
00:41:53,044 --> 00:41:54,846
Like, she wants me to lose weight.

740
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,547
[audience laughing]

741
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:58,216
I have no expectation of losing weight.

742
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:00,118
Some of it is,
I used to have all these jokes

743
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,287
on doughnuts, and now sometimes
when I do shows out of town,

744
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:06,057
people will give me boxes of doughnuts,

745
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,961
which makes me think I gotta
start doing jokes about private jets.

746
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,663
[audience laughing]

747
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,133
I do a show and someone will give me
a box of doughnuts,

748
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,836
or I'll get to my hotel room and in my
hotel room there's a box of doughnuts.

749
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:22,640
And I always look at the doughnuts
like, I'm not not gonna eat those.

750
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:27,879
I mean, those were a gift.
What would Jesus do?

751
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:30,081
[audience laughing]

752
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:31,582
He'd eat the doughnuts.

753
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,720
But it's always a box, a dozen.
A dozen doughnuts.

754
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:39,090
I'm by myself.
I'm typically in the city for one night.

755
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,760
What kind of monster pig
do I come across as?

756
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,129
"How many doughnuts
should we get him?"

757
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:46,998
"Enough for a Baptist church.

758
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,332
[audience laughing]

759
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:50,802
Whatever would feed
an entire Little League team,

760
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,671
that will cover that tub of turds
for a couple hours."

761
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,008
I don't know what to do
with all the doughnuts.

762
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,277
You know, I'll eat two.
All right, I'll eat four.

763
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:02,880
But I don't know what to do
with the rest of them.

764
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,116
What do I,
put them in my rolly luggage?

765
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,652
I did that once. I'm not proud of it.

766
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,755
We've all done things
we're not proud of.

767
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:14,058
You're like, "This is kind of pathetic,
but here goes.

768
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,863
Zip, zip, zip.
Off to the airport we go."

769
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,364
[audience laughing]

770
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:24,168
Of course, that was the time I got
the random search at the airport.

771
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,938
I made it through the metal detector.

772
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,108
This nice TSA guy was like, "Sorry, sir.
Random search of your bag."

773
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,943
And I was like... [laughing]

774
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,012
What I wanted to say is,
"I have drugs in my butt."

775
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,081
[audience laughing and clapping]

776
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,855
'Cause a cavity search at that moment
seemed less humiliating...

777
00:43:45,156 --> 00:43:48,893
than revealing
the true contents of my luggage.

778
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,795
[audience laughing]

779
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:52,029
But I had to do it.

780
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:56,968
So, the TSA guy unzipped the bag. And it
was one of those flat boxes of doughnuts.

781
00:43:57,034 --> 00:44:00,238
You know, like Krispy Kreme.
So, it took up the entire rolly bag.

782
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:03,808
It looked
like I was smuggling doughnuts.

783
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,911
And the TSA guy just looked at me
like, "Wow."

784
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:09,147
[audience laughing]

785
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:10,815
"They sell those here.

786
00:44:10,882 --> 00:44:12,350
[audience laughing]

787
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:14,752
There was a Dunkin' Donuts
two gates away."

788
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:17,321
There was such compassion in his eyes.

789
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:19,690
"You got a problem."

790
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,928
And I couldn't say anything.
I couldn't be like, "Those aren't mine.

791
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:27,698
Some guy gave them to me.
Some guy named Al. Al Qaeda.

792
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,101
- He gave them to me."
- [audience laughing]

793
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,270
I had to act all casual.
"Those are my doughnuts.

794
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,773
I travel with doughnuts. I'm trying to get
diabetes. Why don't you leave me alone?"

795
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,243
And since it was a random search,

796
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:42,046
the actual box of doughnuts had
to be opened.

797
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:44,749
And because I was wheeling
through the airport,

798
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,152
all the doughnuts were crammed
and smushed to one end.

799
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:52,290
It looked like I had rummaged through
a Dumpster outside of a doughnut shop.

800
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:58,930
"Oh, this one's still good. Just get
these rocks and sticks off here.

801
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:04,068
That's a perfectly good powdered sugar...
No, actually, Ajax's on that one."

802
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,803
[audience laughing]

803
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:08,005
The TSA guy just looked at me like,
"You can go.

804
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,242
It's probably your last flight anyway."

805
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:13,844
[audience laughing]

806
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,747
I travel a lot.
I'm constantly going through security.

807
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:20,217
Always behind that person
that's never left their house before.

808
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,456
They always wanna ask me questions like,
"Can I bring soup on the plane?

809
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,227
It's homemade soup."
I'm like, "You should ask them."

810
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,997
"For an ID, can I use a fishing license?"

811
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:34,732
"You should..."

812
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:37,234
"Should I take off my shoes
and my pants?"

813
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:40,905
- "Yes, you should."
- [audience laughing]

814
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,444
Airport security is annoying. It's nothing
compared to international travel,

815
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,814
like going through customs
and immigration. That's so intense.

816
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,249
They're dressed
like SWAT team members.

817
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:55,453
I always get so nervous.
I'm like, "Do I have heroin on me?

818
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:59,790
I don't even know
what heroin looks like.

819
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:02,493
But I might have
accidentally packed some."

820
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,161
[audience laughing]

821
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,497
There's that mini interview
with the customs agent.

822
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:11,202
"What do you plan to do in our country?"
"Murder people.

823
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,804
[audience laughing]

824
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:16,474
You got me, I wasn't ready
for your trick questions."

825
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,509
[audience laughing]

826
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,912
I always feel like an idiot
when I travel internationally.

827
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:24,982
Some of it is,
I don't know the metric system.

828
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,817
It's not like I wasn't exposed to it.

829
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,353
When I was growing up,
they're like, "Learn the metric system.

830
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,323
Everyone learn the metric system.
Big switch coming up."

831
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,259
Then ten years later,
they're like, "Never mind.

832
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,996
It's too hard. It's based on tens.

833
00:46:39,063 --> 00:46:40,297
[laughing]

834
00:46:40,364 --> 00:46:42,333
Let's go buy an SUV."

835
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,435
[audience laughing]

836
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:48,472
So, now I can't ask a distance
when I visit another country.

837
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:51,242
I'm like, "How far is that?"
They're like, "That's 500 kilometers."

838
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:57,348
"I'm not in the Olympics.
This isn't a James Bond film.

839
00:46:57,415 --> 00:46:59,316
What's it in normal speak?"

840
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:00,985
[audience laughing]

841
00:47:01,052 --> 00:47:02,553
I don't speak any other languages.

842
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,823
I have friends that speak Spanish
and French and Portuguese.

843
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:10,828
I don't care. I speak English,
the language Jesus spoke.

844
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,864
[audience laughing and clapping]

845
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,434
At least he did in the movie I watched.

846
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,036
I always love doing that joke.

847
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:22,239
There's always a couple faces
in the audience like, "Don't say that."

848
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,208
[audience laughing]

849
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:25,943
'Cause you travel internationally.

850
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,045
You realize
some people don't like Americans.

851
00:47:28,112 --> 00:47:30,915
I mean, the Canadians like us
and the Israelis like us.

852
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,385
The Australians like Americans so much,
it makes you question their judgment.

853
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:36,053
[audience laughing]

854
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,422
You should read
some of our history. [chuckles]

855
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:43,127
But I get a kick out of what Europeans
don't like about Americans.

856
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:47,064
They're always like, "You Americans are
dumb. You know nothing about Europe."

857
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:50,134
It's not that we're dumb.
We're just not that interested.

858
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:54,205
Sorry I don't wanna learn
more about your windmill country.

859
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:55,940
[audience laughing]

860
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,476
"He's gonna get a wooden shoe
in his ass."

861
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,145
[audience laughing]

862
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,215
First time I did that joke,
the whole front row was Dutch people.

863
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,916
[audience laughing]

864
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,384
And they didn't care. They did...

865
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,571
I don't know. They have no emotion.
It doesn't matter.

866
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,155
[audience laughing]

867
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,258
"He's the most anti-Dutch comedian ever."

868
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,093
[audience laughing]

869
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,329
Obviously,
I love traveling internationally.

870
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:21,232
The only negative,
too many foreigners. Right?

871
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,367
[audience laughing]

872
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:25,903
The weird thing is,
you travel around the world

873
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,140
and you realize pretty quickly,
people are the same wherever you go.

874
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:33,043
Wherever you go, there are good people
and there are Russians.

875
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,912
[audience laughing]

876
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:37,047
[chuckles] See, the reason that's funny

877
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:40,551
is 'cause we were all raised
with this bigotry towards Russians.

878
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,220
I have a friend.
He was born in Russia.

879
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,424
He moved here when he was 3
and I still think he might be a spy.

880
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,326
[audience laughing]

881
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:50,928
We don't know.

882
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:56,066
Best is when you're visiting a country
and someone thinks you're a native.

883
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:59,370
I was waiting for a cab in Stockholm
and this Swedish lady turned to me

884
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,539
and she was like,
"Björn Borg. Björn Borg."

885
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,342
That's not what she said.
That's what I heard.

886
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:07,478
[audience laughing]

887
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:10,948
But I knew in that moment
that once this lady found out

888
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:13,417
I was American,
she was gonna be disappointed.

889
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:17,588
So, I just decided that I was not gonna
speak any language she spoke.

890
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:20,691
She was like, "Björn Borg. Björn Borg."
And I was like:

891
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,126
[gibbers]

892
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:24,528
She was like... [speaks in French]

893
00:49:24,595 --> 00:49:27,164
And I was like... [gibbers]

894
00:49:27,231 --> 00:49:28,942
She was like, "Do you speak English?"
I was like:

895
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,468
[clicks tongue,
then makes beeping noises]

896
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,608
That woman is now my wife.

897
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,643
[audience laughing]

898
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:43,380
"It's just like <i>The Notebook."</i>
"What?"

899
00:49:48,252 --> 00:49:49,453
Still there.

900
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,522
[audience laughing]

901
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:53,796
I wouldn't mind being in shape.

902
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,560
You know who was
in really good shape was Jesus.

903
00:49:56,627 --> 00:49:58,262
[audience laughing]

904
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:01,565
Nothing like the topic of Jesus
to take the air right out of the show.

905
00:50:01,632 --> 00:50:03,434
[makes sucking noise]

906
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,036
That's what he would have wanted.
"When you bring up my name,

907
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:08,072
I want people to be really uncomfortable."

908
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:09,540
[audience laughing]

909
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:13,177
It's not just the Christians.
Everyone's like, "Too soon."

910
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:18,315
"It was only 2000 years ago.
Let it breathe, buddy."

911
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,050
[audience laughing]

912
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:24,054
But Jesus was in amazing shape,
which is especially impressive,

913
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:27,491
considering he could multiply bread
whenever he wanted.

914
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,327
"Boom, pretzel bread."

915
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,796
[audience laughing]

916
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,666
The Bible doesn't specify
what type of bread he multiplied.

917
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:37,601
I imagine it was pretzel bread.

918
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,639
"Boom, pretzel bread.
Boom, garlic knots."

919
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,041
[audience laughing]

920
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:46,477
That's why he had all those followers.

921
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:49,480
"Come on, maybe he'll make
some focaccia bread."

922
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,248
[audience laughing]

923
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,350
This is how people walked
in biblical times.

924
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,185
[audience laughing]

925
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:58,155
They were really
into that Beyoncé "Formation" video.

926
00:50:58,589 --> 00:50:59,657
<i>Alaba...</i>

927
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:02,693
"How many Beyoncé references
is he gonna have?"

928
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:06,597
But who knows?
Maybe Jesus could multiply the bread,

929
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:09,099
but he had no control
over what type of bread it was.

930
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:11,802
He was like, "You want some bread?
Boom, pumpernickel.

931
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,437
[audience laughing]

932
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,806
I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
[chuckles]

933
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:18,676
Still free bread, everyone. [chuckles]

934
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:24,081
Let me try this again. Boom, melba toast.
That's never happened before.

935
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,384
That's the big guy
playing a trick on <i>moi</i>."

936
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,786
[audience laughing]

937
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:32,222
Of course, Jesus was multiplying
the bread to illustrate a point.

938
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,591
He was like,
"I can give you bread that can feed you,

939
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,528
but I can also give you bread
that can feed your soul."

940
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:41,365
But you know everyone was like,
"Yeah. I'll just take the food bread.

941
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,167
[audience laughing]

942
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:47,137
I prefer the food bread
to the soul food bread...

943
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:53,310
unless that's what you call corn bread...
'cause I love..."

944
00:51:53,377 --> 00:51:58,148
"Can you make pizza? I love pizza."

945
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:02,619
I realize religion jokes make
some people uncomfortable,

946
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,822
especially the ones
that are going to hell.

947
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,857
[audience laughing]

948
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:12,496
"Don't you dare.
Get back to your regular food jokes."

949
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,698
This is the point in the show

950
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:17,201
where I usually think about
what I'm gonna eat afterwards.

951
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:18,635
[audience laughing]

952
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,405
I typically get a steak
'cause I'm a man.

953
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:27,344
And I tell you, if eating steak is manly,
it is the only manly attribute I have.

954
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:32,316
I know nothing about cars.
I'm not handy. I can't fix things.

955
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:35,285
Something breaks in our apartment,
I just look at my wife like:

956
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:39,490
"We should call someone."
I don't even call. My wife calls.

957
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:42,760
Some stranger comes over,
I just kind of watch him work. I'm like:

958
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,431
- "You want some brownies or something?
- [audience laughing]

959
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:53,370
My wife could make us some brownies.
I don't know how to work the stove."

960
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,341
Sometimes I try and act like
I have something more important to do.

961
00:52:57,408 --> 00:53:00,744
I'm like, "Yeah. I'm gonna be over here
working on my diarrhea jokes...

962
00:53:00,811 --> 00:53:02,646
[audience laughing]

963
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:06,450
in case you wanna talk sports
or steak or something."

964
00:53:07,451 --> 00:53:09,820
I don't know why steak is
considered manly.

965
00:53:09,887 --> 00:53:13,590
I guess it hearkens back
to when a man would hunt the animal.

966
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:16,627
They kill the animal
and then they eat the animal.

967
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,762
But now we just eat the animal.

968
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:22,966
And it's not as if hunting
a cow was ever that hard.

969
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,568
[audience laughing]

970
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:28,906
"Today, fellas, we are gonna
hunt ourselves the elusive cow.

971
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,276
Oh, there's one right here. All right.

972
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,578
[audience laughing]

973
00:53:34,645 --> 00:53:36,914
How do you get
the milk shakes out of that thing?"

974
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,884
But I do love steak.
I order steaks from Omaha Steaks.

975
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,854
Do you buy your meat online?
That's not a sign of a problem.

976
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:47,591
Just type it in.
A Styrofoam cooler shows up.

977
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:51,295
The same kind of cooler they're
gonna deliver my replacement heart in.

978
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:53,597
[mimics thudding]

979
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:56,300
There's always a neighbor walking by
when I get a delivery, like:

980
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,570
[gasps] "Jim got another box of meat.

981
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,238
[audience laughing]

982
00:54:01,305 --> 00:54:03,974
I imagine that apartment will be free
in a little bit."

983
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,579
Whenever I eat steak at home,
I always use A.1. Steak Sauce.

984
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:11,615
Everyone has
that same thin bottle of A.1.

985
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:14,284
that feels empty
right before it floods your steak.

986
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:16,353
[audience laughing]

987
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:20,324
Everyone's had the same bottle
of A.1. since 1989.

988
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:26,630
I was looking at the ingredients,
"Magic. Magic and prunes."

989
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:29,933
But I love steak.
I love going to a steakhouse,

990
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,835
one of those old-fashioned steakhouses.

991
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:35,005
You go in there, it's dimly lit.
The waiters are no-nonsense.

992
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:38,342
"You're getting a steak, son.
You want a steak, right?"

993
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,977
"Yes, ma'am. I want a steak."

994
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,279
[audience laughing]

995
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:44,014
Have you been to one
of those steakhouses

996
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,949
where they show you
the raw cuts of meat?

997
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:51,321
They just kind of thrust them at the
table. "You can get this one or this one."

998
00:54:51,388 --> 00:54:53,991
And men, we're so visual.
"Throw it. Throw it in my mouth area.

999
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,057
[gibbers]

1000
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:57,394
Me likey meaty."

1001
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,531
They show you a vegetable
like you've never seen one.

1002
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:03,600
"This is a potato."
"That's a potato."

1003
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,068
[audience laughing]

1004
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:08,338
But vegetables in the steakhouse,
they don't come with the steak.

1005
00:55:08,405 --> 00:55:11,308
They're à la carte,
like leg room on Southwest.

1006
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,943
[audience laughing]

1007
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:16,413
They're not even called vegetables.
They're called side dishes.

1008
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,882
'Cause what they do
to vegetables in steakhouses,

1009
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,785
- they're no longer vegetables.
- [audience laughing]

1010
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:24,922
"You can get our spinach
that we cooked in ice cream.

1011
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,990
[audience laughing]

1012
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,093
There's also our house specialty,
which is a baked potato

1013
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,862
stuffed with 20 sticks of butter.

1014
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:33,363
[audience laughing]

1015
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,733
If you're on a diet,
we can do it with 19 sticks."

1016
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:42,039
But I love steak. When I die,
I wanna be buried in a steakhouse.

1017
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,341
Well, not buried.
Just my casket on display.

1018
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:46,643
People in steakhouses,
they wouldn't even care.

1019
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,378
"What's the deal with the casket?"

1020
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,982
"That was a comedian, his one wish..."
"Yeah, I'll have a rib eye."

1021
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,884
[audience laughing]

1022
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:56,053
"Coming right up, Mrs. Gaffigan."

1023
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,921
[audience laughing]

1024
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:07,731
I do love steak,
but it is rather barbaric. Right?

1025
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:10,634
I mean, we're eating a part of a cow
and I love animals.

1026
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:12,502
And I love animal lovers.

1027
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,672
My favorite are the people
that carry around the dog in a bag.

1028
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,475
Whenever I see that, I always think,
"What an adorable way

1029
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:23,413
to let us know you're crazy."
'Cause they're crazy.

1030
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,618
They're carrying around an animal
that can walk in a bag.

1031
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:29,920
They're not going to the vet.
They're shopping.

1032
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:34,825
That's okay. But if I carry around
a canned ham, I'm a weirdo?

1033
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,660
[audience laughing]

1034
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,129
It would be one thing
if the dog looked happy,

1035
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:41,076
but the dog always has a look on his face:

1036
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,533
"Can you believe
I'm sitting in a purse?

1037
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:46,970
I was part of Mexican royalty."

1038
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:52,509
But I get it. I love dogs. And I think
it's cute when people dress their dogs up.

1039
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:56,847
But how do you have your dog in a jacket
and walk by a homeless person?

1040
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:59,549
"Sorry. I'd help,
but I spent all my money on a coat

1041
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:02,986
for my animal that's born with a coat."

1042
00:57:03,053 --> 00:57:05,055
[audience laughing]

1043
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,725
I love cats.
Some people don't like cats.

1044
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:11,662
Our neighbor has a cat
and she lives in a studio apartment,

1045
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:13,864
or as I refer to it, a litter box.

1046
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,565
[audience laughing]

1047
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,669
One time she asked me, she was like,
"Can you tell I have a cat?"

1048
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,672
I was like, "No, but I can tell you have
a box of turds in your apartment.

1049
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,107
[audience laughing and clapping]

1050
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,443
I'm not sure
if that's the same question."

1051
00:57:29,846 --> 00:57:32,649
We all have
the friend with the cat, right?

1052
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:35,686
In a small place. You visit them,
the cat does their business.

1053
00:57:35,752 --> 00:57:38,755
You don't really acknowledge it.
You go on with the conversation.

1054
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,524
"What do you want on your pizza?"
"Bleach.

1055

Febreze. Can we open a window
or knock down a wall?"

1057
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:51,668
"Are my eyes bleeding? How about
we throw a diaper on the kitty?"

1058
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,737
[audience laughing]

1059
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:55,772
But I get it, 'cause I love animals.

1060
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,675
I think being around animals,
there's a healing quality.

1061
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:01,478
But I also think
we give animals too much credit.

1062
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:03,213
Like, a dog is man's best friend?

1063
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,882
I've never seen
a dog help someone move.

1064

[audience laughing]

1065
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:12,489
Yes, horses are graceful and elegant
until you see them poop standing up.

[audience laughing]

1067
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:17,894
Dolphins are smart.
Learn English like Jesus did.

1068
00:58:21,698 --> 00:58:24,901
For the record, I would never eat
a dolphin 'cause I don't like fish.

1069
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,272
And I know I'll get tweets where people
will say, "Dolphins are mammals."

1070
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,008
And those are the people I block.

1071

[audience laughing]

1072
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,945
'Cause that's how I deal
with criticism. [chuckles]

[audience laughing]

1074
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,916
I wish I liked fish. I wish I was
the person in the restaurant:

1075
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,052
"You know,
I don't go out to dinner that often,

1076
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,888
but instead of getting a delicious steak,
I'll get the fish

1077
00:58:44,955 --> 00:58:48,158
- 'cause I like disgusting food."
- [audience laughing]

1078
00:58:48,225 --> 00:58:50,160
'Cause fish is disgusting.

1079
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:53,697
How bored are you with eating
if you're ordering the fish?

1080
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:56,324
You know, "Just bring me
something gross. I like to waste money."

1081
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,138
Who's the first person
to walk into a harbor and go:

1082
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,707
"Hey, whatever reeks in here,
let's eat that."

[audience laughing]

1084
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:09,613
Fish don't even like fish. That's why
they're always frowning. They're like:

1085
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:11,114
"Mmm.

1086
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:16,019
What's that smell?
Oh, it's me. I'm a fish."

1087
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:17,821
[audience laughing]

1088
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,090
What's the best compliment
you can give fish?

1089
00:59:20,157 --> 00:59:22,192
It's to say that it's not fishy.

1090
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:28,698
Isn't fish supposed to be fishy?
"Get the hamburger. It's not burger-y."

1091
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:30,634
[audience laughing]

1092
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,637
Fishy is an indication
something's wrong.

1093
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:37,107
"Something fishy going on here?"
"No, everything's burger-y."

1094
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:39,743
[audience laughing]

1095
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,654
I'm Catholic.
Every Friday during Lent, we eat fish,

1096
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,591
which is supposed to symbolize
the suffering of Jesus on the cross.

1097
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:59,930
What? Which means at one point,
someone was like:

1098
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,132
"How should we honor
the sacrifice of Jesus?"

1099
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:05,135
The other guy is like, "We could fast.
We could starve ourselves."

1100
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:08,004
- "No, that's too easy.
- [audience laughing]

1101
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,873
What if we ate fish?"

1102
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:13,710
The other guy was like,
"I'd rather be crucified."

1103
01:00:15,312 --> 01:00:17,114
It's a true story. It's in the Bible.

1104
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:21,151
Fish? Some cultures,
they eat fish for breakfast.

1105
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:24,888
"Good morning. Here's some fish.
It matches your breath."

1106
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,756
[audience laughing]

1107
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:28,325
I'm not even hungry in the morning.

1108
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,794
Granted, 'cause I ate
a couple hours earlier.

1109
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:35,866
But fish? I was in Iceland. Went down to
breakfast. At the beginning of the buffet,

1110
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:39,402
there was a bottle of fish oil
and 12 shot glasses.

1111
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:42,172
They're drinking fish for breakfast.

1112
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:45,008
I don't know
when you're supposed to drink fish,

1113
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:46,943
but maybe not when you wake up.

1114
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:50,914
"Do you want the orange juice,
the grapefruit juice or the fish juice?"

1115
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:54,084
The best news that ever happened
to grapefruit juice.

1116
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,786
"Finally, I'm not the worst thing
on the planet."

1117
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,855
[audience laughing]

1118
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:02,425
Fish. I was in Israel. Israel.
Went down to breakfast.

1119
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:07,898
The entire breakfast buffet in Israel was
fish, different types of disgusting fish.

1120
01:01:08,698 --> 01:01:12,235
I know it's always comforting when
a pale, blond guy is criticizing Israel.

1121
01:01:12,302 --> 01:01:14,738
[audience laughing]

1122
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,139
"This is gonna go well.

Grab your iPhone."

1124
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:24,147
It's this look. It's not easy looking
like Hitler's wet dream, all right?

1125
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:25,982
[audience laughing]

1126
01:01:26,049 --> 01:01:27,784
This is not a good look.

1127
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:31,755
This is not the look you want
for the tour of the Holocaust Museum.

1128
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:35,425
I've been to the Holocaust Museum in D.C.
I think everyone should go.

1129
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,460
I just suggest you don't look like me.

1130
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:40,430
I was walking around.
People were like, "He did it.

He's not in Argentina.
He's right here. Get him!"

1134
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,011
Actually, I'm too pale for Hitler. Right?

1135
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:58,381
Hitler would have been like,
"I said Aryan, not snowman.

1136
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,319
I mean, meet me halfway, people."

1137
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,221
By the way,
that's how Hitler sounded.

1138
01:02:05,322 --> 01:02:08,124
<i>♪ I'm Hitler, baby
Bum, bum, bum, bum, buh ♪</i>

<i>♪ The Hitler man can ♪</i>

1140
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:14,497
I'm a very pale white guy.

1141
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,801
I have yet to be the victim
of any type of discrimination.

1142
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:21,371
I've been the victim of someone
assuming I'd enjoy a racist joke.

1143
01:02:21,438 --> 01:02:25,242
Have you ever had that? You're like,
"Why would you think I'd wanna hear that?"

1144
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:28,278
"He looks like
he'd enjoy a little hatred.

Maybe this bigotry will brighten his day.

If anyone would have a problem
with pigmentation it'd be the pale fella."

[audience laughing]

01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:42,192
I know what I look like.
I'm not saying I don't forget.

1150
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,295
You ever forget what you look like
and then you walk in front of a mirror

1151
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:48,198
- and you're like, "Oh, no.

When did that happen?"

1153
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:53,403
'Cause during the day
you're like, "I'm Brad Pitt.

I'm John Goodman?"

"What's wrong with John Goodman?"

1157
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:04,147
But it's not that bad.
It's easier to be a guy anyway.

1158
01:03:04,214 --> 01:03:08,084
I mean, there's sexism. But just
the day-to-day life of being a woman.

1159
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,320
Honestly, it looks too hard.

1160
01:03:10,387 --> 01:03:15,158
Just hair, what some women have to deal
with, cut and color and goos and potions.

1161
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,996
What do most guys have to deal with
with their hair? Not having a mullet.

1162
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:25,001
That's all a guy has to do
is not have a mullet. A-plus.

1163
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:29,406
And there are still some guys
that can't pull that off.

"No, you've got a good mullet."

1166
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:39,082
It's easier to be a guy.
Makeup. Some women wear makeup.

1167
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:42,552
Most guys don't change their pants
'cause their belt's in there.

And I'm not saying women are doing
any of these things to please

1173
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,836
or impress a man, but some of it's
self-inflicted, like the eyebrow thing.

1174
01:03:59,903 --> 01:04:01,237
I mean, that's on you, ladies.

1175
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:04,174
There's not a person
on this planet that's going:

01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,011
"I'm looking for someone who's removed
90 percent of their eyebrow hair."

1177
01:04:08,978 --> 01:04:11,381
I don't even know what some
of these ladies are going for.

1178

But it's a man's world.

I don't have a joke for that.
I just wanna remind the ladies.

[laughs]

1184
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,633
I'm kidding. The weird thing is,
if you have little kids,

1185
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,569
if you have little boys and little girls,

1186
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:35,171
you would never think
it would ever be a man's world

1187
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:38,375
'cause if you put a 3-year-old boy
next to a 3-year-old girl

1188
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,841
and you had to pick who was
gonna be in charge in the future,

1189
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:43,947
you wouldn't be like,
"The boy, the one chewing on the table."

'Cause little boys are savages.

I have three little boys. Each of them

It's different. When you have a daughter,
you have thoughts like:

01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,635
"Maybe I should save for med school."

1197
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:09,272
When you have a son, you're like,
"There's gonna be a few rounds of rehab.

I have three boys, two girls.
I have enough kids,

01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:21,251
[audience laughing]

1203
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:26,523
I travel with my kids. My two youngest
are 3- and 5-year-old boys.

1204
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:28,491
And traveling with boys that age

1205
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:31,561
is like transferring serial killers
between prisons.

1206
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:33,630
[audience laughing]

1207
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:38,401
We've seen the movie.
You know it doesn't work out.

1208
01:05:38,468 --> 01:05:40,303
[audience laughing]

1209
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:44,040
My 3-year-old, I love him,
but he's eternally in a bad mood.

1210
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:47,977
He always has a look on his face
like he's gonna shiv you with a crayon.

1211
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:53,583
Or he's pooping.
And sometimes it's both.

1212
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:59,322
And our 5-year-old, he's an escape artist.
He's the El Chapo of children.

1213
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:03,193
You just put him down and he runs.

1214
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,728
And then I have to pay
my 12-year-old to go get him.

1215
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:08,031
[audience laughing]

1216
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,434
Sometimes she can't find him
and I'm forced to stand up...

1217
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:13,136
[audience laughing]

1218
01:06:13,203 --> 01:06:16,005
and look for my own child.

1219
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:20,343
Sometimes I can't find him.
I mean, you always find the kid.

1220
01:06:20,410 --> 01:06:23,246
The joke doesn't end with,
"Now I got four kids," you know?

1221
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:28,218
[chuckles] You find the kid.
They're with a security guard.

1222
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:30,320
They're always with a security guard.

1223
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:34,457
That's an awkward approach
'cause I'm with my four other kids.

1224
01:06:34,524 --> 01:06:37,427
I look like a moving diorama
for birth control.

1225
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:40,263
[audience laughing]

1226
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,066
Doesn't help
that I'm usually eating something.

1227
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:47,604
It's hard to seem concerned about your
child's whereabouts holding a corn dog.

1228
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,205
[audience laughing]

1229
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,574
"Oh, there he is.
Now, where's mustard?"

1230
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:56,179
But that's parenting. It's stressful.

1231
01:06:56,613 --> 01:07:01,117
Parenting is a sacrifice.
It's exhausting. It's expensive.

1232
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,353
At times it feels thankless.

1233
01:07:03,419 --> 01:07:07,090
- But eventually you die.
- [audience laughing]

1234
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:08,224
[chuckles]

1235
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:11,461
My wife hates that joke.

1236
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:17,333
My wife hates that joke.

1237
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,370
And in full disclosure,
she does 90 percent of the work.

1238
01:07:20,436 --> 01:07:23,540
And the 10 percent I do feels
like too much.

1239
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:25,375
[audience laughing]

1240
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:28,278
I'm getting ripped off.
Ten percent of five kids.

1241
01:07:28,344 --> 01:07:30,813
That means I'm in charge
of one kid for like half a day.

1242
01:07:32,181 --> 01:07:33,650
I'm like a single mom.

1243
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,585
[audience laughing]

1244
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:38,755
That's a joke where the audience thinks,
"Maybe Jim is a dick."

1245
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,291
[chuckles]

1246
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,061
My wife is amazing.
Even in the most stressful moments,

1247
01:07:45,128 --> 01:07:47,330
I will catch her looking at me
with an expression

1248
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,832
that could only be described as regret.

1249
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,768
[audience laughing]

1250
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:57,407
But she's Catholic, so there's no quitting
the team. Thank you, Jesus.

1251
01:07:57,473 --> 01:07:58,775
[audience clapping]

1252
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:07,116
I'm aware my wife is out of my league.
She's very thin and attractive.

1253
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:09,419
I look like I had two wives
and I ate one of them.

1254
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:10,820
[audience laughing]

1255
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,632
She's amazing. She's my writing partner.
We do everything together.

1256
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:18,094
- She's brilliant. She's "creative...
- [audience laughing]

1257
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:21,164
and tal..."
I can't read her handwriting.

1258
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:25,702
No. We're totally equals. I mean,
when we rent a car, I won't let her drive.

1259
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,105
And that's not sexism.
I just don't wanna die.

1260
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,506
[audience laughing]

1261
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:33,276
She can drive my kids around.
I don't care about that.

1262
01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:36,245
But if I'm in the car, uh-uh.

1263
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:39,215
She's amazing.
Probably the most impressive thing

1264
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:41,150
my wife can do is her ability
to remember

1265
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:43,586
absolutely every horrible thing
I've ever done.

1266
01:08:44,487 --> 01:08:47,190
She'll bring it up.
We'll be watching TV. She'll be like:

1267
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:50,326
"Remember that time you humiliated me
when we went out to dinner?"

1268
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:56,733
"Now I do. Must have blocked it out
searching for self-esteem."

1269
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,135
[audience laughing]

1270
01:08:59,202 --> 01:09:01,437
I don't wanna misrepresent her.
She's very forgiving.

1271
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,573
It's just the forgetting part.

1272
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,476
But we all aspire to be forgiving.

1273
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:10,313
Pope John Paul II forgave the guy
who tried to assassinate him.

1274
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:11,781
I mean, granted he was the pope.

1275
01:09:11,848 --> 01:09:14,317
He couldn't be like,
"Let's torture this bastard."

1276
01:09:14,884 --> 01:09:16,419
He kind of had to forgive him.

1277
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,789
But Pope John Paul II went
to the guy's jail cell and forgave him.

1278
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:23,426
But then he left. It's not like
then he had to live with the guy.

1279
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,829
Like, if the pope lived with the guy,
we would have seen how long

1280
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:28,931
that forgiveness would have lasted.

1281
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,367
"Pope, your turn to do the dishes."

1282
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:32,702
"Didn't you shoot me?

1283
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:34,737
[audience laughing]

1284
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:37,640
I think it's always your turn
to do the dishes.

1285
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,443
Bless you, my son."

1286
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,714
Pope, that's a tough job.
Anyone pope here?

1287
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,216
- [audience laughing]
- No?

1288
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:51,354
Pope's a tough job. You know
it's tough 'cause the last one quit.

1289
01:09:52,321 --> 01:09:54,691
He's like, "I'm done. I'm out of here."

1290
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:58,227
Everyone at the Vatican was like,
"You're supposed to speak for God

1291
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:02,498
until you die," and the pope was like,
"Uh... God told me to quit.

1292
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:04,233
[audience laughing]

1293
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,635
And to eat more cheese."

1294
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:09,505
Our new pope, Pope Francis,
calls people on the phone.

1295
01:10:09,572 --> 01:10:11,808
I don't know why you'd ever believe
it's the pope.

1296
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,443
"Hello?" "It's the pope."

1297
01:10:13,976 --> 01:10:17,213
"Oh, can you hold on?
I have Spider-Man on the other line."

1298
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,681
[audience laughing]

1299
01:10:20,817 --> 01:10:24,821
My wife loves talking on the phone
and I would rather be hit by a car.

1300
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,424
I'm not saying a big car,
but a Mini Cooper.

1301
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,960
I'd take that over
a 20-minute conversation.

1302
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:35,732
She's always like, "It seems like you're
trying to get off the phone." "I am.

1303
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:40,970
I love you. I just can't hold
my arm up for this long."

1304
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,474
I can't believe
any of us talk on the phone.

1305
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,776
There's e-mail and text.

1306
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:49,345
Sometimes my phone rings,
I look at it and I think:

1307
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,982
"This person better be calling to tell me
their hands are chopped off."

1308
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,817
[audience laughing]

1309
01:10:54,884 --> 01:10:58,521
"I just wanted to hear your voice, Daddy."
"Buy my album."

1310
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:00,590
[audience laughing]

1311
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:05,328
That is all for me.
Thank you so much.

1312
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,864
[all cheering]

1313
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,723
[belches]

1314
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,725
