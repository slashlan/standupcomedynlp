1
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:54,967
What's up, San Antonio?

2
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,098
Oh-ho-ho-ho!

3
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:01,943
Oh, I'm so excited to be here!
Thank you, guys, for coming out.

4
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,980
I love San Antonio. I got here last night.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,685
And I asked this chick,
"What do you guys do here for fun?"

6
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,316
- And she's like...
- "I'll tell you what to do."

7
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,123
"You're gonna drink,

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,909
you're gonna get plastered,

9
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,414
you're gonna end the night
with Five Guys."

10
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,707
I had no idea
Five Guys was a burger place.

11
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,143
I'm like, "Wow, you must be popular!"

12
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:40,768
"I'll start with one."

13
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,694
My idea of a threesome
is me with a pint of Ben & Jerry's.

14
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,151
I don't know what we're doing.

15
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:51,106
It's so good to be here. I've been
traveling non-stop for over a year.

16
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,874
And I've seen all of the country, and wow!

17
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,407
I was recently in North Carolina
and I went into this bar,

18
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,463
and I asked the bartender
for an Old Fashioned.

19
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,915
So he took away my voting rights.
I was like, "Whoa, that's..."

20
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,841
"Whoa! Whoa!"

21
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,053
I'm kidding. I'm Latina. I don't vote.

22
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,804
We don't vote! We don't vote!

23
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,635
Not unless it's<i> American Idol</i>
or <i>The Voice</i>, right? We don't do it!

24
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,936
We don't do it.

25
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,855
I'm kidding. I love to vote. I do it,
like, five, six times in an election.

26
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,741
I love it that much.

27
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:39,163
Am I the only one
that just got tired of the election?

28
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,082
The election we've had...

29
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,958
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

30
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,627
I'm done. And you know what pissed me off?

31
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,460
When I started hearing people say, "We
need to go back to the good old days.

32
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,465
We need to go back to the good old days."

33
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,350
You ever notice
it's only white people saying that shit?

34
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,227
Brown people,
when was our good old days, right?

35
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:06,598
Hmm.

36
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,226
If it was really the good old days,

37
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,863
why don't you ever see black people
doing Civil War re-enactments, right?

38
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,612
You never see that!

39
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,783
Never see that conversation.

40
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,162
"Hey, Lamar,
what are you doing this weekend?"

41
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,990
"I'm gonna go to my neighbor's house,
I'm gonna cook and clean for free."

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,906
"You know, like the good old days."

43
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,085
I'm Latina. When was our good old days?

44
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,684
When JLo became Selena?
That's what we get?

45
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,393
That's what we get? Okay!
That's what we get.

46
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,060
Selena.

47
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,020
For those of you that don't know Selena...

48
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,027
Selena is the closest thing Latinos have
to a superhero.

49
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,115
She is a Mexican-American singer.

50
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,700
She died over 20 years ago and we still
talk about what she could've done.

51
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,787
"Oh, if Selena was still here... Oh-ho-ho!

52
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,584
Oh-ho-ho-ho!"

53
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,537
"Ooh!

54
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,757
Trump would build a wall,
she would knock it down with her voice!"

55
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,470
<i>♪ Um-biddy-biddy-bum-bum ♪</i>

56
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,470
Down! Down! Down! Down!

57
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,140
Down!

58
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,478
Oof.

59
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,191
We shouldn't laugh, guys.
Trump's gonna build a wall.

60
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,120
He is! Shut up! He is!
He's gonna build a wall.

61
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:46,039
All the way to California. You know
what's after California? The ocean.

62
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,949
Fuck it. We'll swim. I don't care.

63
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,415
Build a wall!

64
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,916
Does he know if he builds a wall, all he's
doing is making us amazing athletes?

65
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,585
We gotta run, we gotta climb,
we gotta swim.

66
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,085
He's making, like, an immigrant triathlon.

67
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,474
First place is freedom!

68
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,860
He's gonna build a wall.

69
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,949
Doesn't he know we use tunnels now?

70
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:27,367
Build that wall as high as you want,
stupid. We're underground!

71
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:32,997
We should help them.

72
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,343
We should do a BYOB party -
bring your own brick,

73
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,958
and we just build it, like...

74
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,415
Stupid!

75
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,929
Did you guys see that dude?

76
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,142
Did you guys see the tunnel Chapo had
when he got arrested?

77
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,564
That shit looked like a Disneyland ride!

78
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,984
There was lights, a guy selling tickets,
a two-hour wait.

79
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,107
There was a Starbucks.

80
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,282
"I'll have the Chapo-ccino, I guess."

81
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,877
Isn't it weird to think
we have a candidate...

82
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,716
that has to tan that's trying to deport
everybody that doesn't have to tan?

83
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,589
That's fucked up!

84
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:27,466
When you think about it,
tanning is such a double standard

85
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,934
because white people can go
and be dark for a week.

86
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:32,675
I can't go anywhere and lighten.
That's bullshit.

87
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,233
I like hearing white girls
talk to their friends.

88
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:40,614
"- Hey, girl, you wanna go tan?
- Let's go be ethnic for a week."

89
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,781
"Don't worry, we're still white."

90
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:55,575
"Hi, I'm Becky. I have cornrows. Fuck it."

91
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,075
I love it!

92
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,053
It's a double standard.
White people have tanning booths.

93
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,553
There's no bleaching booth
for me to go to!

94
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,676
I would love that!

95
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,562
Go in, like, "Hey,
I need to be two shades whiter this week.

96
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,350
I've got a job interview."

97
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,518
Oh, shit.

98
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,478
Oh, shit. Oh!

99
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,486
Ooh! Ooh.

100
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,159
I'm sorry. I dropped something.
The truth, right?

101
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,210
So weird... What a weird time
we live in politically, you know?

102
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,130
I live in LA.
In California, weed is legal.

103
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,421
- Yeah!
- Isn't it weird? No, don't.

104
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,625
Think about it. How fucked up is that? We
started legalizing weed before immigrants.

105
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,177
How fucked up is that?

106
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,681
We started legalizing weed
before immigrants.

107
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,104
When I was a kid,
I was told weed was a drug.

108
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,313
"Don't do it. It'll ruin your life."

109
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,814
"Don't do it. It'll ruin your life."

110
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:04,106
Now they're like, "Ah, we were messing
with you. Go ahead. Get high. Go!"

111
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,242
"Ah! Go!"

112
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,200
"Lupita, watch the kids.
I'm gonna go smoke. Bye!"

113
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,326
Lupita's like, "Can I get a green card?"

114
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,410
"Hell, no! You can get
a pot card, though, right? Huh?"

115
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,036
"Can I get papers?"

116
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,504
"Rolling papers?
Hell, yeah, you can, Lupita!

117
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,294
Ooh-ah! Ooh-ah!"

118
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:28,552
San Antonio, I'm home. I'm from Texas.
I'm from South Texas.

119
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,183
Ooh!

120
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,391
Oh! I love it!

121
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,444
I come from a small town.
We had a really big, bad gang problem.

122
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,994
The problem was, we only had one gang.

123
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,945
How do you only have one gang?

124
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,031
Who are you fighting with? No-one.

125
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,237
The gang started tagging walls
in our town,

126
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,497
"TCB number one, bitches!"

127
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,500
No-one would argue with them.

128
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:04,383
So the next day it would be like,
"Uh-huh, that's right."

129
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:11,552
After a month, they just had a wall
of positive affirmations on the wall.

130
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,095
People would say, "Is that your church?"

131
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,389
"No, that's our gang."

132
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,476
"They're confident. We're proud of them.
They're gonna be big."

133
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,110
If you guys don't know what it's like
to grow up with a gang,

134
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,073
let me put it in perspective for you.

135
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,663
It's kind of like when there's
a Walmart and a Target near each other.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,330
And you gotta pick which one you're with.

137
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,910
It's all about territories and colors,
you know.

138
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,826
Walmart's blue. Target's red.

139
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,836
If you're Walmart,
I don't wanna see a red pullover

140
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,299
in my neighborhood, bitch,

141
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:50,508
or I will slash you,
like I slash prices up in this bitch!

142
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,630
I don't even care!

143
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,806
Walmart for life.

144
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,059
I'm kidding. I'm Target.

145
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,147
I'm gonna tattoo a bullseye.

146
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,110
I grew up poor.

147
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,446
It's weird, when you're a kid,
you don't know that you're poor,

148
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,293
because you always think
that everyone lives like you.

149
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,619
When I was in fourth grade,
I realized I was poor

150
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,584
because I was a really big fan
of New Kids On The Block.

151
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,996
I loved them, right?

152
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,418
I couldn't afford
to see them in concert, right?

153
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:35,385
So I had this fantasy when I was a kid,
you know, that I was gonna meet them

154
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,888
and they were gonna
fall in love with me, right?

155
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,431
No joke, you guys.
This was the fantasy. Fourth grade.

156
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:45,347
I was gonna be the maid on their tour bus.

157
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,315
And I was gonna clean things so good...

158
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,533
that they were gonna fall in love with me!

159
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,988
In my head, I thought they were
gonna get on the tour bus and be like,

160
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,155
"Oh, my God.
Who made that bed right there?"

161
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,584
You know what I mean?

162
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,082
"Oh, my God."

163
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,495
"This tour bus is so clean.

164
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,714
Who made that bed right there?

165
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,174
Who made that bed right there?
Who made that bed right there?"

166
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,716
You know?

167
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,640
Like, yes.

168
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,890
Yes.

169
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,925
And then I would say, "I made that bed."

170
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,186
And they would be like, "We love you now."
And I'm like...

171
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,937
That was it.

172
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,233
I was in fourth grade.

173
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,778
Then 20 years later,
I thought about that story,

174
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:41,873
I looked back and I was thinking, "Why
the fuck was I a maid in my own fantasy?"

175
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:48,502
Like, even in my fantasy,
I can't give Latinos better jobs?

176
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,549
And then I started thinking about it,
and you know why?

177
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:59,681
It's because a lot of the women I knew,
that's what they did for a living.

178
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,931
They cooked at restaurants.
They cleaned houses.

179
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,555
They came here and had those jobs
to get a better life

180
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,194
so that their kids
didn't have to do those jobs.

181
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:13,231
And when I understood that, I realized

182
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,606
that as a woman, I wanted to break
that glass ceiling, you know?

183
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,906
Yeah.

184
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,580
But as a Mexican, I wanna clean that shit,
too. You know what I mean?

185
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,183
Where's the Fabuloso?

186
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,650
The purple one!

187
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,146
Bitch, like there's any other kind!

188
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,950
I finally got to see the New Kids
when I was 33.

189
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:10,957
They reunited, right?

190
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,460
My boyfriend at the time
went to the concert with me

191
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,213
because he wanted to see me lose it.

192
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:20,512
He's like, "Hey, are you gonna be okay?"
I'm like, "Dude, I'm 33. I got this, bro."

193
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,019
"I love you! I love you!"

194
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,900
Oh, my...

195
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,528
And then within minutes,
I started realizing, "Oh, my God...

196
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,236
This is a stadium
full of 30 to 40-year-old women

197
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,445
watching these grown-ass men...

198
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,410
talking about dating chicks
in high school."

199
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:56,165
I was like, "Oh, my God.
They didn't update the songs at all!"

200
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,217
Because now I'm an adult, right?

201
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:07,141
I remember, when I was a kid, I used to
love the song "You Got The Right Stuff" <i>.</i>

202
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,311
And I'd love it
because the lyric was like,

203
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,980
"First kiss was a sweet kiss,
second kiss had a twist."

204
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,981
And I'm like,
"Oh, my God. They're Frenching." Right?

205
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,189
But I'm 33 at that point, so I'm like,

206
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,526
"Third and the fourth kiss,
we're doing it."

207
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,948
"Those tickets were expensive, my friend
got a babysitter, you gotta give me more."

208
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,542
"You gotta hang tough and give me more."

209
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,961
They really should update those songs,
though. I mean...

210
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,958
"You Got The Right Stuff"<i>.</i> I'm in my 30s.

211
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,717
The song should speak to me, you know?

212
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,472
<i>♪ You got good credit ♪</i>

213
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,635
<i>♪ Baby ♪</i>

214
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,598
<i>♪ Your FICO score turns me on ♪</i>

215
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,772
Yeah!

216
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,902
You know, it's weird,
in your 30s, you're not old,

217
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,859
but you realize in your 30s,
every year you start realizing

218
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,401
there's one thing every year
you can't really do any more, you know?

219
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:04,526
I live in Los Angeles.

220
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:08,412
I'm at that age where
the only way I can get into a nightclub

221
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:12,411
is by telling the door guy that
I'm looking for my underage daughter.

222
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,081
But then I have to pretend to look
for the bitch the entire night.

223
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,706
"Where's Stephanie? I don't know where
Stephanie's at. Is she down here?"

224
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,456
"She's not down here."

225
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,947
Oh.

226
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,699
I am Catholic.

227
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,487
I'm what I call a barely Catholic.

228
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,828
Like, I'm barely...
My parents, my family...

229
00:15:55,913 --> 00:16:00,383
I'm Catholic because my family is,
but I don't know a lot. I know the basics.

230
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,670
When people find out I'm Catholic,
they love asking me questions.

231
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,054
I'm like,
"Oh, God. Let it be an easy one."

232
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,059
"Who's the guy on the cross?"

233
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,889
"Jesus! Yes! Yes!"

234
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,522
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"

235
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,188
Sometimes they get harder.
"Why do you use holy water at church?"

236
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,355
"Oh, God.

237
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,565
It's because we hate vampires."

238
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:42,835
You ever notice Latinos are the only ones
that name their kids "Jesus"?

239
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,548
"This is my son Jesus Rodriguez.
He works at Papa John's."

240
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,592
"Oh!"

241
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,255
"Jesus has come a long way!"

242
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,644
You never meet a white guy named Jesus.

243
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,023
"Hi, I'm Jesus Rosenberg.
I work at Goldman Sachs."

244
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,402
It's insane.

245
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:12,066
You guys ever notice that you always
find out what you think of your friends

246
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,026
when you can't remember their names?

247
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:17,496
Because then you have
to describe them to people.

248
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,078
And you never say nice shit
about that person.

249
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:25,384
It's always, "What's that guy's name?
The fat one. Loser. Lives with his mom.

250
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,381
Hector! Hector! Yes!"

251
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,173
"Yes! Hector!

252
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,337
Hector! Yes!"

253
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,637
"Tell him hi."

254
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,194
"I don't think you like Hector, dude."

255
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,436
It's insane.

256
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,107
I'm a first generation American, you know?

257
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,531
It's hard to be first generation

258
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,820
because you have to learn
how to be American

259
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,324
and teach your parents
how to be American, too.

260
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,077
Like, for me in Texas,
I'm a big sports fan. I love sports.

261
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,330
I'm from Texas. I love football.

262
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,623
Now...

263
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,577
Here's the thing.

264
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,166
People don't understand,
when you're a sports fan,

265
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,132
when you have a team, that's your team.

266
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:09,462
Those are your boys.

267
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,877
Whether they suck or they're good,
those are your boys, you know?

268
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:18,177
People are passionate about sports.
I'm from Texas. I like football.

269
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,144
I love the Cowboys, right?

270
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,939
Not everyone clapped. See, five minutes
ago, you all loved me, but now...

271
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,824
I get it!

272
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:36,033
You know how hard it is
to be a fan of a team that sucks?

273
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,656
It's like you're dating that guy
that can't get his shit together.

274
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,375
Every season,
they make promises they can't keep.

275
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,465
"No, baby, come back.
This year, I promise you a ring."

276
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,430
"Oh, great!"

277
00:19:00,765 --> 00:19:02,555
It never works!

278
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:07,193
My friends tell me all the time,
they say the same thing,

279
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,231
"Switch teams, you gotta switch teams."

280
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,475
That's my team!

281
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,776
I can't do that. That's my team.

282
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,990
It's like having a kid
that's flunking math.

283
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,161
You're like, "I'll cheer
for the neighbor's kid. He's smart."

284
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,040
You can't do that!

285
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,328
You can't.

286
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,666
You show up wearing a jersey,
"Neighbor's kid, 82."

287
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:39,347
What pisses me off about watching sports
is the press conferences after the game.

288
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,718
Do we have to interview them
when they lose?

289
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,773
Everybody wants to find out,
"Why did you lose? Why did you lose?"

290
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,192
"Well, shit, the other team scored more.

291
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:50,984
That's how it works."

292
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,113
What a terrible time
to get interviewed about stuff!

293
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,242
Can you imagine if that happened to you?

294
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,658
For shitty parts of your life,
you have to give a press conference?

295
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,543
You get fired from a job,

296
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,160
"Why did you get fired?

297
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,754
Why did you get fired?"

298
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,042
"Well, shit,
I steal office supplies, so I..."

299
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,304
"We'll get them next time."

300
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,596
I'm first generation. It's hard, man.

301
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:28,102
Because, again, you have to teach
your parents how to be American.

302
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,805
It's tough because
you're learning it, too, you know?

303
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,356
You guys, my mom...

304
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,687
had never seen
Girl Scouts before in her life.

305
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:37,824
Never.

306
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,817
The first time she saw Girl Scouts...

307
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,779
she thought
they were Border Patrol agents...

308
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,174
..in training.

309
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:00,934
She thought Border Patrol had a kid unit.

310
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,009
And every time she saw the cookies,
she would hide from them.

311
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,476
I'd say, "Mom, they're not trying to
deport you. They're selling cookies."

312
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,810
"Ah, that's what you think! Oh-ho-ho!"

313
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,107
"That's how they get you!
God, you're stupid!"

314
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,534
"That's how they get you.
You get hungry, you buy Thin Mints.

315
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:24,334
And then I'm back in Mexico.
No cookies in this house!

316
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,950
No cookies!"

317
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,211
What people don't understand, though,

318
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,343
is that when you grow up
with immigrant parents,

319
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:41,431
you have to rely on them to do
their version of American holidays.

320
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,636
So they gotta go with what they know,
you know?

321
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,680
Like, my mom was from Mexico. People
don't understand, Mexico is south of us.

322
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:51,726
But life is totally different there.
They don't get that.

323
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,561
My mom,
she didn't grow up with Santa Claus.

324
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,607
There was no Santa Claus in her village.
There was the three wise men.

325
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,775
Now, we celebrate December 25th,
like everybody else.

326
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,833
But we celebrate January 6th, too.
That's our big day.

327
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,162
And I have a theory that we do January 6th

328
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,538
because all that shit's
on clearance by that time.

329
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,804
That's what we do.

330
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:27,013
So one year, my single mom tried to do
her version of Santa Claus, right?

331
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:31,096
I wake up, there's a gift-wrapped box
with a card that says, "Santa Claus."

332
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,773
I look at my mom.
She's like, "I am Santa Claus."

333
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,871
"What?"

334
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,779
"I am Santa Claus. Merry Christmas."

335
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,373
"No, no, no, I did not bust my butt so
this white guy takes credit for my shit.

336
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,456
I am Santa Claus. Me.

337
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,382
Ho, ho, ho!"

338
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,000
"Ho, ho, ho!"

339
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,836
"And I say it in Spanish with a J.

340
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:05,925
Ho, ho, ho!

341
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,300
I am Santa Claus."

342
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,700
She was a cute woman.

343
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,659
My mom, not kidding, she would buy
photo frames, picture frames,

344
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,492
and she would keep the pictures
that came with the frames.

345
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,832
And she would hang them up on the wall.

346
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,042
And she would call them her white family.

347
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,336
And every time we would get in trouble,
she would use them as an example.

348
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:51,215
"Cristela, you're flunking math.
Why can't you be like your cousin Peggy?"

349
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,980
"She's graduating college. Why can't you?"

350
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:17,407
People don't understand, when you grow up
between two cultures of any kind,

351
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,958
it's hard because you start realizing
that certain things you do

352
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:23,673
that are considered,
you know, like, American

353
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:26,384
are ridiculous
to the other side of your family.

354
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,255
I had to ask my mom for permission
to go on spring break

355
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,223
to go swim with the dolphins, right?

356
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,183
"Mom, can I go swim with the dolphins?"

357
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,723
"What's that?"

358
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,480
"How much is that?"

359
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:39,227
"$200."

360
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,398
"Do you get to eat
the fucking thing after?"

361
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,985
"Oh-ho-ho!"

362
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,239
"No, go,
and then when your brothers are hungry,

363
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,945
we'll show them
a picture of you riding the dolphin."

364
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:07,724
"Oh, my God.
She's exercising with her food. Okay!"

365
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,836
"I'm gonna go bike-riding with tamales.
I'll be right back."

366
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,935
I tried asking her for an allowance once.

367
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,730
She said, "No, you get one. I allow you
to live here for free, stupid."

368
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:33,655
"I allowance the lights,
I allowance the food,

369
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,871
all the allow!"

370
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:43,785
My mom was like a die-hard Catholic woman.

371
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,706
Like, she was super Catholic.
She loved God but she hated people.

372
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,005
In my neighborhood,
we were always visited every weekend

373
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,853
by the Jehovah's Witnesses, right?

374
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,048
Every weekend.

375
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:59,268
My mom couldn't stand it
because she's like, "I'm team Catholic.

376
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,269
Why are they trying to convert me?"

377
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:05,189
And every day, they would come in.
One day, they knocked. "Da-da-da."

378
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,516
"Excuse me, ma'am. Have you found God?"

379
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,490
She's like, "No, but if you find him, tell
him we're fucking starving in here. Bye."

380
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:26,422
We ended up getting a dog
and that dog used to bark at everyone.

381
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:30,632
Everyone, right? My mom loved it because
the Jehovah's Witnesses stopped coming.

382
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,427
And one day, the dog died,
and they caught on,

383
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,970
and they came back and started knocking,
and my mom wasn't ready for it.

384
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,055
She's like, "No! Woof!"

385
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,812
"<i>Perro</i> woof!"

386
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,265
<i>Perro </i>woof?

387
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,652
How the hell does the dog have an accent?

388
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,117
<i>Perro </i>woof?

389
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,379
That's so crazy.

390
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:12,714
Isn't it crazy to think
how fast the year goes by?

391
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,968
Every year, you get older, I feel like I
can't believe we're already at this point.

392
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,512
Like, you know?
Every year goes by quicker and quicker.

393
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,097
It's insane, you know?

394
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,022
And I feel bad because at this point,

395
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:27,941
I told myself that I was gonna
get my shit together this year.

396
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,361
This was gonna be the year, you guys!

397
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,105
I've been trying to get in shape.

398
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,485
Ooh!

399
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:42,202
You guys, I went to the gym today.

400
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,746
Oh-ho-ho!

401
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,543
Man, I'm going inside tomorrow, but...

402
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,723
I had to find it first, dude!

403
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,264
It's right next to my McDonald's.
I had no idea.

404
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,896
It's hard. You ever realize
how hard it is to get in shape?

405
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,228
Because everything costs money.
It's expensive to get in shape.

406
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,565
Everything costs money.
Workout clothes are expensive.

407
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,645
You guys,
I went to a store called Lululemon.

408
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,617
Now I know why they lose weight.

409
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,739
They can't afford to buy food
after they buy that shit!

410
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,959
It's insane!

411
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,790
If you don't know what Lululemon is,

412
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:33,585
it's a store that sells workout clothes
for people who don't need to work out.

413
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,920
They're thin.

414
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,888
I went into the store, right?
Guess what I found out.

415
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,598
I'm too fat
to fit into their workout clothes.

416
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,015
I'm too fat to work out?

417
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,986
I have to lose 20 pounds
before I can start working out.

418
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,504
I didn't wanna leave empty-handed,
so I looked for anything that fit.

419
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:11,079
I'm like, "Where the hell are your
headbands? You don't have headbands?

420
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,496
Wristbands?"

421
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:17,014
"You don't sell key chains?
They don't sell key chains here!"

422
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:26,313
Finally, I found a sports bra
that kind of fit, right?

423
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,442
Kind of fit.
Like, if I light a candle and pray...

424
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,275
I can put it on.

425
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,358
You know when you try clothes on that fit,

426
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,613
but you don't know
how you're gonna get them off?

427
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,070
"I need scissors." Like that, right?

428
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,620
I looked at the price.

429
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,123
80 bucks.

430
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,170
80 bucks!

431
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,751
I was like, "80 bucks?

432
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,710
For 10 bucks, I can go to Home Depot

433
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,877
and hire a day laborer to hold them up
when I go jog."

434
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,319
"Ándale,<i> Pepe."</i>

435
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:35,333
It's expensive!

436
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,627
I keep trying to work out,
but I don't think I wanna work out.

437
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,761
I always say the same thing.
"I am gonna start on Monday."

438
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:48,262
And then Monday comes, I eat a doughnut,
and I'm like, "Damn it!"

439
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,478
"Now I gotta wait till next Monday!"

440
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,152
I can't start on Tuesday!

441
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,452
It's insane.

442
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,921
I recently bought the Zumba DVDs.

443
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,251
Now, there's a Zumba DVD set
that comes with maracas.

444
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,340
It's like the little weights, right?
So you can keep the beat along with them.

445
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:30,507
The other day, you guys, I popped it in.
Oh, I wish you had been there, man.

446
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,427
Oh! I was killing it, you guys.

447
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:41,399
I was, like, sweating. I was like, "Oh,
my God. That must have been 20 minutes."

448
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:45,113
Four minutes. Four minutes. Four.

449
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:47,405
Four. Four.

450
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,119
Four.<i> Cuatro.</i>

451
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,696
I got tired, right? I go into the kitchen
to get a glass of water.

452
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,290
There's a bag of popcorn right next to it.

453
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,495
I'm like,
"Oh, my God. That looks so good."

454
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,302
So I pop the bag of popcorn

455
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:08,342
and go back into the living room
with my popcorn and my water,

456
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,507
and the DVD's playing.

457
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,514
I'm like, "Oh, my God, I'm working out!"

458
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,768
So what do I do?

459
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,897
I sit down and I watch the DVD
like it's a movie! Like...

460
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,865
"I love Zumba."

461
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,513
And you can't just work out, either.
You gotta eat healthy food.

462
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,845
You know? Healthy food is expensive.

463
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,020
And that's bullshit because poor people
can't afford it. I hate that.

464
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,021
I can't stand that.

465
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:06,149
People don't realize, when you grow up
poor, you don't learn how to eat right,

466
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,074
because it's not about eating right,
it's about eating.

467
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,614
People don't get that.

468
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:15,367
When I was a kid, I was raised on
McDonald's because that shit was cheap.

469
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,542
I mean...

470
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,407
single mom, McDonald's.

471
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:22,077
Dude, the McRib came back more times
than my dad, you know what I mean?

472
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,473
I say that in every city
in case he's out there.

473
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:52,275
Back when I was growing up, you could feed
a family of four for, like, 20 bucks.

474
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,914
Family of four, 20 bucks.

475
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,328
But if you wanna make a salad at home,
boom, $1,000.

476
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,752
I went to Whole Foods.
My God, that store should have layaway.

477
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,093
What the fuck are we doing at Whole Foods?

478
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,389
I walked in.
They're like, "Can I help you?"

479
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,259
I'm like, "No, I'm just here
to visit my tomatoes, thank you."

480
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:21,601
"I think I'm gonna get them out next week.
I'm really excited."

481
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:31,276
"I'm buying eggplant.
They're checking my credit."

482
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:43,162
I started walking around the store.
They were having a sale.

483
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,918
Ooh!

484
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,590
Ooh!

485
00:34:46,668 --> 00:34:49,088
A sale at Whole Foods.

486
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,716
Six bucks for a pint of strawberries.

487
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,513
Because they're organic.

488
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,564
Six bucks. I was like, "Ho-ho-ho-ho!

489
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,520
That's a lot of money. I'm sorry.

490
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:06,061
For that much, you'd better show me
a photo of white people picking the fruit.

491
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,186
What the fuck is that?"

492
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:21,871
Forget Jose and Maria, man. I want Becky
and Brian out in the field picking that.

493
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,291
Healthy food is so expensive.

494
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:31,086
And how do they justify it?
How do they justify it?

495
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:35,761
Now they tell you the life story of every
animal you're about to eat at the store.

496
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,934
You walk down the aisle,
it's like Ancestry.com for cows.

497
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,942
Every animal has its story.

498
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,612
"Oh, this milk is hormone-free.

499
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,359
This beef is grass-fed.
This chicken is cage-free."

500
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:56,363
"Fuck, these animals
had a better childhood than I did!"

501
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,748
"I grew up in the hood,
I had bars on my window,

502
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,579
but this chicken was cage-free.

503
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,995
Okay!"

504
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,917
Oh!

505
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,048
There I am in the bedroom.
"How is it outside, chicken?"

506
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,491
"I wish I could be a cage-free kid,
but..."

507
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,819
"gangs."

508
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,214
This chicken is expensive
because I'm paying for the hobbies it had

509
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,040
when it was alive?

510
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:56,757
This chicken's $20 a pound because it
played the cello and it liked to surf.

511
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:01,757
That's an awesome chicken!
Why are we eating it?

512
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,104
If I had to eat something that had
an awesome life and didn't do shit,

513
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,732
screw the chicken, I'd eat a Kardashian.

514
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,770
Oh, my God!

515
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,530
Have you seen their butts?
They could feed villages for months.

516
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,327
That's what people don't realize
and it bugs me,

517
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,956
that when you grow up poor,
life is different.

518
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,383
People don't get it. When you grow up
without money, life is different.

519
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,844
You have to learn how to live without
certain luxuries in life, you know?

520
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,255
Luxuries. Like air-conditioning.

521
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,599
Or food allergies.

522
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,566
I didn't even know those were a thing
until, like, five years ago, man.

523
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,741
It's insane.

524
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,661
Isn't it weird that the more money you
make, the less food you're allowed to eat?

525
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,115
When you're poor, you eat whatever you can

526
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,753
because you never know
when that next meal is coming.

527
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,330
We don't have the luxury
to be allergic to shit!

528
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:18,665
That's a conversation
you'll never hear in the hood, you know?

529
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:21,666
"Yo, man, they killed Mario."

530
00:38:21,758 --> 00:38:23,298
"What, drive-by?"

531
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,394
"No, peanuts."

532
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:36,307
Drive-by honey-roasted.

533
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,623
And don't misunderstand me.
I grew up poor, but I grew up happy.

534
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,833
You know?
Like, you don't need money to be happy.

535
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:01,047
It fucking helps, but...

536
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,590
you don't need it.

537
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:08,264
It's like I said before, when you're
a kid, you don't know you're poor.

538
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,886
Because everybody you live around
is pretty much on the same level.

539
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,055
You don't get it.

540
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,602
I grew up in the 80s.

541
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,016
In my neighborhood, everyone was poor.

542
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:20,605
Back then, the only way
you could tell someone had cash,

543
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,742
you'd walk into their living room and they
would have a set of encyclopedias.

544
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,627
"I knew Juan was doing good."

545
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,672
"I didn't know
he was doing encyclopedia good!"

546
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,798
"Nita, he's got the Q!"

547
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,324
I feel like half of you don't know
what the fuck an encyclopedia is.

548
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,489
Right?

549
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:14,325
It's the internet but in books.

550
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,750
It's where the word "Wikipedia" came from.

551
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:26,085
Isn't it weird to think that people
don't know what encyclopedias are?

552
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:29,514
They don't know the pain
of having to do homework with that shit.

553
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:32,894
Getting a book report...

554
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:37,022
Having to go to the library,
hoping the volume hasn't been stolen yet.

555
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,608
You show up, it's gone.

556
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,491
You're like, "Oh, I'm gonna
make up some shit about Japan!

557
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,149
I don't know!"

558
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,372
Isn't it weird that
that's where we are with technology?

559
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,035
We used to have books everywhere.
Books, books, books.

560
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,384
Most of us didn't read them
but they were there.

561
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:07,625
Now everything we've got is in
our little phone, right there. Everything.

562
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,385
Technology can be so amazing and it can be
so terrible at times, you know?

563
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,719
You know what pisses me off?
It's great for kids. It sucks for me.

564
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,306
It pisses me off
that kids will never know the pain

565
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,812
of having to save up money

566
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,936
to buy a whole record album or CD

567
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:26,858
for one song.

568
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,208
Do you remember

569
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,879
when you had to do chores?

570
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:47,260
You'd hear a song
on a thing called the radio...

571
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,546
or MTV,

572
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,092
and you're like, "I want that!"

573
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,596
You'd have to save up, like, 20 bucks,

574
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,599
hoping the whole thing was a hit.

575
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,064
Because if you bought a CD that was
a one-hit wonder, you're like, "Fuck!"

576
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:05,192
You never get over it!

577
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,937
I spent 20 bucks on<i> Whoomp There It Is.</i>

578
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,655
20 bucks!

579
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:18,291
I thought Tag Team was back again.
They fucking never showed up!

580
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,133
"Rico Suave."

581
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:37,393
I thought I was fucking
guessing good on that one.

582
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:42,975
But technology isn't all great.
I mean, some parts of technology suck.

583
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,061
I'm gonna assume
that everyone in this room,

584
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,901
we have all been screwed over
by autocorrect.

585
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,533
At one point or another, right?

586
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,284
We're not stupid.

587
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,584
Why does our phone
wanna fuck up our friendships, dude?

588
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,829
And it sucks
when you text in another language.

589
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,325
I text with my sister in Spanish, right?

590
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,553
Okay, so the other day,
I was texting my sister.

591
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,459
I'm trying to call her a<i> pendeja.</i>

592
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:18,763
For those of you that don't know,
<i>pendeja</i> is a term of endearment.

593
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:21,139
Right?

594
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,436
You know?

595
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:30,269
Like, it means bitch, but it depends on
how you say it, you know?

596
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,278
You could be like, "Bitch!" or you could
be like, "Bitch!" You know what I mean?

597
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,742
I'm more like, "Hey, bitch!" You know?

598
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,123
And I text her, I'm like, "Hey,<i> pendeja."</i>

599
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,999
She writes back,
"Why did you call me a pencil?" "Fuck me!"

600
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,880
"You're, like, all stupid. You're
a number<i> dos</i> pencil. You don't even..."

601
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:57,594
Even worse...

602
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,059
a couple of months ago, a friend of mine
sent me a video of a puppy.

603
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,270
I love puppy videos. Love them, right?

604
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,402
I wrote back,
"Tee hee hee, I love puppies."

605
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:13,532
Autocorrect changed "Tee hee hee"
to "Hey Jew Jew."

606
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,446
She's Jewish.

607
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:30,504
And not only that,
autocorrect capitalized every letter.

608
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,209
Like I'm fucking yelling it at her.

609
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,667
"Hey! Jew! Jew!

610
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:39,257
I love za puppies!"

611
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:53,404
It went from being cute to a hate crime
in one second.

612
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,942
I started thinking, "Oh, my God.
What if that happens when I need help?"

613
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,488
I send out a text like,
"Help, I'm stuck in a ditch!"

614
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:01,572
and she's like,
"Help, you stuck up bitch!"

615
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,965
I have to take care of her. She's one
of my only girlfriends, you know?

616
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,549
I don't have a lot of girlfriends.
I'm a tomboy.

617
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,555
I grew up with guys. I grew up with
brothers, you know? I'm not very girly.

618
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,139
And I come from
an old-school Mexican family.

619
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,694
They expect you to always wear makeup
and be dressed up, you know?

620
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:33,400
My mom would be like,
"Why aren't you wearing makeup?"

621
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,981
"Because I'm going to bed, dude!
It's, like, late!"

622
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:44,156
"And how are you gonna find a man
in your dreams?"

623
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,415
As a tomboy, what I wear...

624
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,382
Now, what I'm wearing,
this is like my typical outfit.

625
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,883
T-shirt, jeans, sneakers,
I love it, right?

626
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,886
Very comfortable.
Dress like that every day of my life.

627
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,549
And I've noticed
I'm usually cool with it,

628
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:09,638
but I've noticed that every now and then,
people judge me on how I dress.

629
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,555
And it sucks
because they always guess wrong, normally.

630
00:46:12,645 --> 00:46:14,225
You know? And it's annoying.

631
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,363
And I'll tell you,

632
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:19,239
the places that it happens a lot at
are the expensive stores...

633
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,744
where people think
that I can't afford to shop there.

634
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:23,822
You know what I mean?

635
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,407
Look...

636
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,449
I don't wanna brag...

637
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,920
but I've got money.

638
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:37,709
Okay?

639
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,375
Okay?

640
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,604
I've got the kind of money, like,
when I'm sick, I go to the doctor.

641
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,574
In the United States.

642
00:47:08,034 --> 00:47:09,124
That's rich.

643
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:14,172
When I get sick, I'm like, "Grandma, keep
your Vicks. We're going to the doctor."

644
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,538
That's how much money I've got.

645
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:21,958
Rappers make it rain champagne,
I make it rain penicillin.

646
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,968
I'm like, "Right there. Everybody..."

647
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:35,897
So I was at Bloomingdale's,
in the clearance section.

648
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:42,283
I can afford clearance,
not the regular-priced stuff, okay?

649
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,648
I'm at Bloomingdale's
and I see a bag that I like

650
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,778
and it doesn't have a price.

651
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,735
And I stand by it

652
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,035
and people start walking
and no-one stops, right?

653
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,910
They just walk, walk, walk.

654
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,207
Finally, a woman walks by. I'm like,
"Da-da-da-da! Hey...

655
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,803
how much is this bag?"

656
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,877
She's like, "Oh."

657
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:09,432
"It's $800. Hmm."

658
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,642
"Okay."

659
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,685
"I'm gonna buy that bag."

660
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:24,033
She's like, "Oh, are you? Hmm."

661
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:30,235
"I'm just gonna take the bag and hold it
up front until you're ready to check out."

662
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,334
Bitch!

663
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,620
So we're at the cash register, right?
And she's typing, typing, whatever.

664
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,957
It's taking forever, like she doesn't
think I'm gonna buy the bag,

665
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,514
like halfway through I'm gonna be like,
"JK, I'm poor! Bye!"

666
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,341
Typing, typing.

667
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,137
Here's a thing you gotta know about me.
My mom taught me to never complain.

668
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,983
We don't complain.

669
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,018
If I get the wrong food at a restaurant,
I eat the wrong food.

670
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,273
I don't complain, right?

671
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,145
But this woman's being so terrible,

672
00:49:03,232 --> 00:49:05,402
like, obviously terrible, right?

673
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,204
"Nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah."

674
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:12,369
I'm like, "Look, I'm sorry.
I've gotta stop you. You are being awful.

675
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:15,659
You're being rude
and I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

676
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,328
Now, I don't even want this bag."

677
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:28,755
"I'm buying this bag because
I've got the money to buy this bag.

678
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,678
And not only that.

679
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,389
This bag is for me,

680
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,469
and I want you to gift-wrap it."

681
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:40,022
"That bag is for me, but I wanna
surprise myself: 'What did I get me?'

682
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,312
I want you to surprise...

683
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,605
Gift-wrap it. Gift-wrap it."

684
00:49:48,027 --> 00:49:50,567
And I stood there.
I'm like, "More ribbon."

685
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,254
I pay, she gives me the card,
blah, blah, blah.

686
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,962
I'm like,
"I'm doing this to teach you a lesson.

687
00:50:04,043 --> 00:50:06,093
I don't know what it is about me,

688
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:10,260
but for some reason, you think
that I can't afford to shop here.

689
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,391
I don't know
what you expect me to wear to this store,

690
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,509
like, what, a fucking wedding gown?"

691
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,234
"Need I remind you
that I'm shopping at Bloomingdale's,

692
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,229
and you're fucking working
at Bloomingdale's, okay?"

693
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,569
"Now give me my fucking bag. Thank you."

694
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,619
I left. I was walking off.

695
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,871
You guys, that is the closest...
That was like the movie<i> Selena.</i>

696
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,665
Like, "We don't want that dress."
You know what I mean?

697
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,630
Like<i> Pretty Woman:</i> "Big mistake."
Like, that's where I was.

698
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:56,215
I left. I was like...

699
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,393
I was waiting to get outside
and just lose it, you know, like...

700
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,599
I walked out of that store with pride.

701
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,857
I walked out of that store with dignity.

702
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,859
And I got into my car and I was like,
"Yes!"

703
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,409
And I drove to the closest Bloomingdale's
to return that fucking bag.

704
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,412
Because I couldn't afford it,
but I taught that bitch a lesson,

705
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,292
and that's all that matters!

706
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,836
That's a lot of money!

707
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,888
I don't have that kind of money!

708
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:40,223
Oh, my...

709
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:43,975
But I've got 12 bucks for the gift-wrap,
oh, yeah!

710
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:46,943
Oh! 800 bucks!

711
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,653
You know when you ask...

712
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,822
When you ask for the price of something
and it's too expensive,

713
00:51:52,901 --> 00:51:55,201
but you gotta pretend
it doesn't mess with you?

714
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,779
"Oh, 800 bucks!"

715
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:01,121
"Only?"

716
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,910
"I'll take five of them."

717
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,415
But on the inside, you're like...

718
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:11,250
"That's two tomatoes at Whole Foods!"

719
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,887
Man, I buckled it in like it was a baby.
"Nobody touch it! I'm returning it!"

720
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,568
I am a tomboy.

721
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,689
There are things I like
that are kind of girly, like my music.

722
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,198
I love love songs.

723
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:40,619
And one of my favorite love songs
has been ruined by a commercial.

724
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:45,288
It's the abused puppy commercial
from Sarah McLachlan.

725
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,420
Do those commercials
have to be 30 hours long?

726
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:54,713
And they're always in the middle
of the funniest thing you're watching.

727
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:58,797
You guys, those commercials have ruined
that Sarah McLachlan song for me.

728
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,388
A couple of months ago,
I was taking a shower,

729
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:05,431
I had my iPod on shuffle, loving life.

730
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:07,176
Killing it.

731
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:11,017
Listening to, like, Ace Of Base,
<i>"</i>TheSign" like, nailing it, right?

732
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,855

It became the most depressing shower
I've ever had!

739
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:39,027

The fucking puppy!

744
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:30,541
San Antonio, I just wanna say
thank you so much for coming tonight.

745
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:50,562
It means a lot.
It's a very special night for me.

746
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:51,929
I'm glad you guys came out.

747
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:56,983
Most of you might remember,
I had a show on TV called<i> Cristela.</i>

748
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,574
Thank you.

749
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,619
I...

750
00:56:10,701 --> 00:56:13,621
- I loved that show and...
- Bring it back!

751
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:23,054
I wish I could. I can't bring it back.
But thank you.

752
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,384
That's my dad.

753
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:30,601
"Mija, what did you say about the McRib?"

754
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,859
I loved that show.

755
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:41,148
That show...

756
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:43,815
That show was really
about a part of my life

757
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,950
where I'd moved in with my sister,
I helped take care of her kids and my mom,

758
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,740
and it was very important for me
to do that show.

759
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:55,454
You might notice, in my stand-up,

760
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,537
I talk a lot about my mom.

761
00:56:57,623 --> 00:56:59,213
And for me...

762
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,753
if you saw the show,
she was this very crotchety old woman.

763
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,431
She hated everyone, you know?

764
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:11,598
But, like, if she made fun of you,
that meant she loved you.

765
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,928
You know what I mean?

766
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:17,483
And for me,
my mom was always the star of my show.

767
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:23,858
I talk a lot about my mom because I feel
like when we talk about immigrants...

768
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:27,403
we never really give them
a heart or a soul.

769
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,280
And I wanted people to know
the story of my mom

770
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,905
and know that she was a real person
and she was like that,

771
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,873
and that she went through a lot
so that I could be here tonight.

772
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,325
That's why I do it.

773
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:52,836
And, you know, for some people,

774
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:56,138
my experience
isn't their Latino experience.

775
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,983
And I get that, you know?
I just wanted to show mine.

776
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:01,059
I wanted to show my life, you know?

777
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,864
The show wasn't called
<i>Every Latino In The World.</i>

778
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,436
It was called<i> Cristela.</i>

779
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,485
And for me,
I wanted to show a mom like that

780
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:12,108
because you ever notice that the moms
on TV, they're never like that?

781
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,117
They're always kind of the same.
They're always very happy.

782
00:58:15,951 --> 00:58:19,751
They never get mad.
My mom used to get mad, you know?

783
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,750
They never get mad. Think about it.

784
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,384
Paper towel commercials.

785
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:31,762
You guys...

786
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:35,509
the kid will drop,
like, a gallon of orange juice.

787
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:40,024
Orange juice! That shit's expensive!

788
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:46,114
I don't care if that's Sunny Delight
or Tampico.

789
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,534
That shit is expensive.

790
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,453
For those of you
that don't know Tampico...

791
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,455
Tampico is an orange liquid.

792
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:16,929
You can buy, like,
30 gallons of it for a dollar.

793
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:23,024
And it glows in the dark. Like,
why the fuck does it glow in the dark?

794
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:27,901
I keep a gallon of it in the fridge
in case there's a power outage.

795
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:31,991
I just take it out.
I'm like, "Everybody follow the Tampico."

796
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,696
"Everybody."

797
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,200
It's like a highlighter you can drink.

798
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,619
Tampico.

799
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:48,170
The mom and the kid clean it up,
then they have a dance party.

800
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,961
My mom wasn't like that, you know?

801
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:52,916
And, you know...

802
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:56,594
You guys have been a great audience

803
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,216
and I'm actually
going to tell you a story

804
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,144
that I don't normally tell people,

805
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:05,733
and after tonight,
I will never tell this story again.

806
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,270
But it's a story
of the kind of woman my mom was,

807
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,357
in case you didn't believe
that she was really like that.

808
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:21,029
This story is a very true story and it...

809
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,499
It takes a lot out of me,
but I wanna say it,

810
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:30,130
because, again, I'm trying to let people
know what kind of mom my mom was,

811
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,840
what kind of person she was.

812
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,756
When I was 21...

813
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,335
I moved to Los Angeles by myself.

814
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,719
I didn't know anybody.

815
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,310
And I lived in my car
for a very long time.

816
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,847
And my family didn't know that
because I was the baby,

817
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,766
and I didn't want them to worry.

818
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:54,112
And at 21, my oldest brother calls me
and tells me...

819
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:56,823
that our mom is sick

820
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,413
and I have to go home.

821
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,489
Now, I'm 21

822
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,445
and...

823
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,535
it's a hard thing to hear.

824
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,289
So I go home to visit my mom,

825
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,083
and when I get there,

826
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,669
my brother tells me,
"You know, we didn't wanna scare you.

827
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,303
She's pretty bad.

828
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,050
We brought you here
so that you could say bye to her."

829
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,887
Now, at 21,
we all think we know everything.

830
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,229
We all think we're adults,
we have our shit together.

831
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:32,690
But trust me, when you get news like that,
you realize that you're nothing but a kid.

832
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,936
Your 30s, 40s, any time you get that,

833
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,317
you realize that you're still a kid.

834
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:43,332
When I heard that,
I didn't know what to do.

835
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,542
Because I had that chance.

836
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:48,709
Now, you gotta know,
I come from an old-school Mexican family.

837
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,538
We don't tell each other how we feel.

838
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:53,792
You know, like...

839
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,377
we hide it.

840
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,471
We make fun of each other.

841
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:02,589
We don't hug, we don't kiss,
we insult each other.

842
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,638
"Hey, fatso, you're fucking fat!"

843
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:18,073
My family wasn't like that.
Like, that's what we did.

844
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,401
We didn't hug and stuff.

845
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,606
And I thought to myself...

846
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:26,122
"If you're like this first generation
and you're one of the few

847
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:28,831
that's doing the first of everything
in your family,

848
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:31,002
do something, do the first of something.

849
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:34,921
Tell this woman what you think of them,
what you think of this person.

850
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,381
Tell her how you feel."

851
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:40,049
I thought,
"Can I tell my mom how I really feel?"

852
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:42,221
And I thought, "If not now, when?"

853
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:45,304
I went inside to her room...

854
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,813
and she looked different.

855
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:54,845
Sometimes they don't tell you
that they'll look different.

856
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,475
And the moment I saw her...

857
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,110
I cried.

858
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,738
And I was like...

859
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:05,242
"I love you.

860
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:09,453
You're the most important person
in my life.

861
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:14,581
Everything I do,
I do to honor your journey.

862
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,167
And if I could bargain with God...

863
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,048
I would shorten my life
so that you could have a longer one,

864
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,184
and I would take care of you
until you died

865
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:28,891
and make sure that you had
the happiest life ever."

866
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:33,309
And she started crying.

867
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,733
Which surprised me.
I didn't know she could.

868
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,156
And it was sad.

869
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,832
At the same time, I thought,

870
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:53,540
"How great is it
that I got the chance to say that?

871
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,461
How great is it
that I had that last moment,

872
01:03:56,541 --> 01:04:00,091
that I got to tell her how I felt,
how much I loved her...

873
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,553
right before she died?"

874
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:09,217
And then she didn't die.

875
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:35,334
She didn't fucking die!

876
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:45,509
Do you know how awkward the next day was?

877
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:51,137
"Oh!"

878
01:04:54,516 --> 01:04:57,806
"You're still here?" "Uh-huh!"

879
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,320
That woman...

880
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:04,276
lived for another year.

881
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:08,704
And every day, she would make fun of me.

882
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:12,655
And called me a pussy.

883
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,674
For being so weak.

884
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,420
Every day, "Cristela, I want a hamburger."
"You can't have one. You're sick."

885
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:27,094
"But you love me!"

886
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:33,851
Thank you, guys, for coming, San Antonio!

887
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,390
Thank you so much! You guys
have been amazing! Thank you so much!

888
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,845
Thank you, thank you!

889
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,902
Thank you.

890
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,113
Thank you.
