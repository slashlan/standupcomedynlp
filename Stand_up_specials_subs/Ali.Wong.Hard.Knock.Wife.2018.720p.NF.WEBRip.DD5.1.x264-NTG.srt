Oh, my goodness!

19
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,404
I heard a rumor

20
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:58,058
that all of the Asians in this city...

21
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,146
Have congregated
in this theater tonight.

22
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,066
Yeah.

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,922
Thank you for coming
with your white boyfriends.

24
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:12,947
I really...

25
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,368
Appreciate it,
from the bottom of my heart.

26
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,892
I'm so excited to be here.

27
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:27,420
I have not been performing that much

28
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,317
at all, in the past two years,

29
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,970
because two years ago,
I gave birth to a baby girl.

30
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:47,357
And when I first started to come back out
to do stand-up,

31
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,252
the other stand-up comics,
they couldn't believe it.

32
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,195
They were like, "Oh, my God, Ali...

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,323
"What are you doing here?

34
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,203
"Didn't you just have a baby?"

35
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,206
I was like, "Listen...

36
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,127
I've been with my baby girl
since she was born,

37
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,588
all day every day.

38
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:16,136
And I love her so much.

39
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:22,142
But I'm on the verge
of putting her in the garbage.

40
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,611
I need to be here to miss her,

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,074
So that I don't go to jail."

42
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,182
It's so sexist when people ask me,

43
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:49,210
"Well, if you're here,
then who's taking care of the baby?"

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,052
Who the fuck do you think
is taking care of the baby?

45
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:07,061
The TV is taking care of the baby, okay?

46
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,193
The windows are open, she's got
gummy vitamins on her lap, she's fine!

47
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,199
I tried being a stay-at-home mom,

48
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,327
for eight weeks.

49
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,873
I like the stay-at-home part.

50
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,507
Not too crazy about the mom aspect,
that shit is relentless.

51
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,573
I was stupid and naive, and I thought
that being a stay-at-home mom

52
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:46,893
was about chillaxing,
getting to shit in your own home,

53
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,856
Watch <i>Wendy Williams</i> and go out
to brunch with your sassy girlfriends.

54
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,879
I did not understand

55
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,174
that the whole price you have to pay
for staying at home

56
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,700
is that you've gotta be a mom.

57
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,995
Oh, and that's a job.

58
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,873
It's a wack-ass job.

59
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,896
You get no 401K, no co-workers.

60
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,942
You're just in solitary confinement
all day long

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,884
with this human Tamagotchi...

62
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,933
That don't got no reset button,
so the stakes are extremely high.

63
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,903
A toy Tamagotchi is more communicative
than a human baby.

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:44,301
Okay? Because the toy will at least
tell you when it poos.

65
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,179
With a human baby, you just have to guess

66
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:51,666
and check your intuition
by sniffing its ass...

67
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,396
Twenty-six times a day.

68
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,023
And you can't phone it in
and sniff it from afar.

69
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:03,112
You really gotta flip the baby over,
plant your face in the baby's ass

70
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,949
and give it a good yoga inhale
with your mouth and everything,

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,476
because the inside of your nose has been
singed from all the poo-poo smelling.

72
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:21,505
That's how I know I love my baby more
than anybody else in the entire world.

73
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,408
I told my husband "Till death do us part."

74
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,745
And not once have I ever...

75
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,623
sniffed his ass...

76
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,174
To check if he shit his pants.

77
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,431
I've licked it, but I haven't sniffed it.

78
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:01,003
Because sniffing it would be disgusting!
Okay?

79
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:05,323
And if you haven't licked ass yet,
grow up. Grow the fuck up.

80
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,160
And learn how to be
in a long-term, committed,

81
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,056
lasting-relationship full of love

82
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,124
where you have to make sacrifices
for the greater good.

83
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,889
My dream, my goal for the longest time
was to be a trophy wife,

84
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,727
but then I found out
that in order to be a trophy wife,

85
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,563
you have to be a trophy.

86
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,693
I am more of a commemorative plaque.

87
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:52,036
I joined a moms' group in Los Angeles.

88
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:59,019
Yeah, I don't find any of these bitches
particularly interesting or fun,

89
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,939
but when you're a new mom
on maternity leave,

90
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,440
it's like <i>The Walking Dead,</i>

91
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,759
you just gotta hook up with a crew
to survive.

92
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,578
I used to hate on other moms
for the clothes that they wore.

93
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,914
You know these fucking clothes
that moms wear,

94
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:22,358
all that cheesy-ass animal print and...

95
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,195
loud metallic shiny shoes.

96
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,494
And now I see something that's bedazzled
in rhinestones, and I'm like, "Oh...

97
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,288
That looks nice.

98
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,249
I think I'ma get that!"

99
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,061
The more glitter the better,

100
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:44,922
because when you're a mom
you need sparkle.

101
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,970
To compensate for the light inside of you
that has died.

102
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:04,192
A lot of young women have anxiety
about giving birth.

103
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,694
Well, let me tell you something.

104
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,449
Giving birth ain't nothing

105
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,494
compared to breastfeeding!

106
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:20,726
Breastfeeding is brutal.
It is chronic physical torture.

107
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,629
I thought it was supposed to be
this beautiful bonding ceremony,

108
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:29,193
where I would feel like I was sitting
on a lily pad in a meadow

109
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,029
and bunnies would gather at my feet

110
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,906
while the fat Hawaiian man version

111
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,890
of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"
would play.

112
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,814
No!

113
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,710
It's not like that at all!

114
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,421
Breastfeeding is this savage ritual

115
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,115
that just reminds you
that your body is a cafeteria now!

116
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,328
It don't belong to you no more.

117
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,016
When my baby girl would get hungry<i>,</i>

118
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,894
she'd yank my nipple back and forth

119
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,755
like that bear fucking up
Leonardo DiCaprio in <i>The Revenant</i>.

120
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,902
It's frightening. I saw that movie,

121
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,554
and my nipples were like,
"I feel you, Leo!"

122
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,957
I didn't take any classes
on breastfeeding,

123
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:30,087
because I assumed it was just gonna be
this very easy intuitive thing

124
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,882
where the baby sucks on your nipple
like a straw,

125
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,759
and the nurse promised me

126
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,244
that I would have
a particularly easy time,

127
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,955
since my nipples look like fingers.

128
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,438
You can spin DVDs on them,

129
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,591
that's how Command hook-like they are.

130
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,453
But apparently, you have to get the baby
to latch on at a very specific angle.

131
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:08,250
You gotta tilt their head and do geometry
to get them on properly.

132
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,543
And it's very stressful,

133
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,045
because when they're hungry
and they're crying,

134
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:16,216
it makes your hormones spray milk
all over their face and their neck,

135
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,427
which then become very slippery
and hard to grip<i>,</i>

136
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,805
and then you gotta slam them on
at just the right time.

137
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,225
And every time I would do it,
it was like parallel parking.

138
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,584
I don't know how I did it!

139
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:32,065
It's a mystery. I was never
properly trained, but I just did it.

140
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:36,445
I just went back and forth,
and back and forth, and back and forth,

141
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:41,098
until all these very concerned strangers
start gathering outside of my car.

142
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,763
Those people who gather
outside of Asian women's cars

143
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,829
while we're parking...

144
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,959
Are so helpful and so racist
at the same time.

145
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:16,384
I'm always like, "Thank you.
Thank you, but fuck you...

146
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,638
For assuming correctly about me!

147
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,810
I could not have done this without you!"

148
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:38,006
My mom saw me struggle with breastfeeding

149
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,343
and she was very discouraging about it,

150
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,662
and she was like,
"Why are you breastfeeding?

151
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:49,208
I raised you on formula
and look how shiny your hair is."

152
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,800
She was like, "Are you falling
for that bullshit slogan,

153
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,802
'breast is best'?"

154
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,222
I was like, "No...

155
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,308
I do it because breast is free.

156
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,524
Come on, Mom, you know what it is.

157
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:19,297
Local, organic, free-range,
farm-to-mouth milk

158
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,841
squirting outta my titties."

159
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,969
It was squirting out of like 15 holes
in each titty,

160
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,745
like the Bellagio fountain, just, "Woo.
Woo, woo, woo.

161
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,874
Woo, woo, woo."

162
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,377
For free!

163
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,464
My body was a food factory.

164
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,134
I wasn't about to let that all
go to waste.

165
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,554
If you shat juicy hamburgers...

166
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,814
Would you ever wait in line
at In-N-Out again?

167
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:59,570
No, you would pop a squat
over your husband's head every morning.

168
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,741
And tell him to open wide...

169
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,454
Because breakfast is on the way...

170
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,416
Animal style.

171
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,212
Yeah, you'd be like,
"I got your secret menu right here."

172
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,381
♪<i> Work, work, work, work, work ♪</i>

173
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:32,728
I had to stop breastfeeding
after eight and a half months.

174
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:34,939
I could not take it anymore<i>.</i>

175
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,733
By the end, I felt like <i>The Giving Tree</i>.

176
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:43,781
I used to not-understand
what that depressing-ass book was about.

177
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:47,284
And now I know it's about breastfeeding!

178
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:55,227
It's about a mom who used to have all
of these beautiful branches and apples,

179
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:59,189
and then this little freeloader
comes into her life,

180
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,024
takes all of her shit,

181
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,527
and then she just becomes
a sad-ass tree stump

182
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,135
with deflated titties!

183
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,244
People kept on asking me,

184
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:16,081
"Ali, how did you get so skinny
after the baby?"

185
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,274
She sucked the life outta me!

186
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,424
As it turns out,
breastfeeding is not free

187
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,512
because you have to buy
all of these pillows and pumps

188
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,556
to support your breastfeeding,

189
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,916
and then you might get a clogged duct.

190
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,087
That's when you get like a traffic jam
kidney stone in your titty,

191
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,008
and then
you have to call a lactation consultant.

192
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,679
A lactation consultant is a white
NPR listener with dreadlocks,

193
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,434
Named Indigo,

194
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,830
That you have to pay $200

195
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,065
to rush over to your house
and Roto-Rooter your titty.

196
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,296
Indigo had me do push-ups,

197
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,657
dipping my titty in and out of a bowl
of scalding hot water,

198
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:12,119
and then beat my titty like this
in the interim.

199
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:19,001
This is why women need maternity leave.

200
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,902
In every other First World country...

201
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,280
Canada, France, Germany...

202
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:34,534
Women get up to three years off
paid maternity leave

203
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,119
when they have a new baby.

204
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,039
In the US, we get jack shit.

205
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:43,043
In the US, there is zero federal policy
for maternity leave.

206
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:46,588
Maternity leave is not just to bond
with the baby.

207
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,780
Fuck the baby!

208
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:55,329
Maternity leave is for new moms to hide
and heal their demolished-ass bodies!

209
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,815
I couldn't go back to work topless
beating my wet titty,

210
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,676
trying to establish dominance
over all my coworkers.

211
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,886
You'd get fired!

212
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,787
People don't tell you
about all the crazy shit

213
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,958
that goes down when you get pregnant,
when you give birth<i>.</i>

214
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,042
When I was pregnant,

215
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:27,545
a lot of other moms
had highly recommended to me,

216
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:33,826
"Ali, now you make sure at the hospital
to steal a bunch of the free diapers."

217
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,473
"Yeah, duh, I know for the baby."

218
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,792
"No. For you..."

219
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,927
"For me?
What the fuck do I need diapers for?"

220
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,431
"Oh, you'll see..."

221
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,853
Winter is coming."

222
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,488
And indeed I did see!

223
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,658
Nobody told me about all the crazy shit that
comes out of your pussy after you give birth.

224
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,931
You know what happens
after the baby comes out?

225
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,415
You know what else exits?

226
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,168
Her house.

227
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,467
Her living room, her pillows...

228
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,635
the Bob Marley poster...

229
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:39,034
All the food that went bad
in her refrigerator... for months!

230
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,579
So then you have
to wear this cartoonishly large pad.

231
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,290
That's like the size
of a toddler mattress,

232
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:49,919
and it's only held up by the strength
of this mesh fishnet underwear

233
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,423
that's exclusively available
at the hospital.

234
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,509
You can't get that shit
on Amazon or anything,

235
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,994
so you gotta snatch that shit every day.

236
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:04,500
It's made out of the same material
that they package fancy Korean pears in.

237
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,760
It's very <i>Dac Biet</i>, okay?

238
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,014
Number one extra large <i>Dac Biet</i>
hospital underwear.

239
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,955
For three months,
I was walking around my house

240
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,316
with a top knot,
giant diaper, nipples bleeding.

241
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,778
Like a defeated sumo wrestler.

242
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,768
I had a C-section. Yeah.

243
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,480
Which was not the original intention,

244
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:56,736
but I was having contractions
for 24 hours. Yeah.

245
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,264
And then I was like, "Cut it out."

246
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,080
The nurse was like, "Keep going."

247
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,982
I was like, "Bitch, I said cut it out. <i>♪ Your
price is way too high You need to cut it ♪</i>

248
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,863
<i>♪ Cut it, cut it, you need to cut it</i>♪

249
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,329
The nurse was not a big hip hop fan, so...

250
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,168
She did not appreciate that
or my Dave Coulier reference.

251
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,108
Look, a C-section is no joke, okay?

252
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,694
It is major surgery.

253
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,737
But it's very fast.

254
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,532
They put the anesthesia in your back,

255
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,076
and then they put up this curtain

256
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,289
so that your husband can only see
your human side

257
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,357
and not your cadaver side.

258
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,089
And then ten minutes later,

259
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:02,075
they hold the baby above the curtain
like bloody Simba and it's over.

260
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,125
I was like, "What the fuck did I do
all that pushing for

261
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,712
when there was this perfectly good
emergency exit?"

262
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,572
One of my best friends, God bless her,

263
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:27,100
she was in labor for 72 hours.

264
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:31,146
The baby's head kept on going in and out,
and in and out, and in and out.

265
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:40,530
And then she still had to have
an emergency C-section.

266
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,992
Before that shit went down,

267
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,287
my friend was the kindest,

268
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,207
Most polite<i>,</i>

269
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,893
dainty lady,

270
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,378
who would never burp in front of anybody.

271
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:57,398
After that shit went down,

272
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:03,345
she became the most bitter, nasty,
raw-ass bitch I have ever met in my life!

273
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,450
I went to her house to pay her a visit
shortly after,

274
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,285
she opens the door,

275
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,187
"Look at my pussy, Ali.
Look at this shit! Look at this!"

276
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:23,383
No, "Hello, Ali. Welcome.
Come meet my beautiful new baby."

277
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,534
No, just, "Come on, you look at this shit!

278
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,079
"You look at what happened to me!"

279
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:37,504
Just with the door open,
in front of the entire cul-de-sac to see,

280
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,797
"Come on!"

281
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:52,394
And her pussy looked crazy!

282
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,024
It looked cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs!

283
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,068
When I saw it, I was like...

284
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:07,034
Because her pussy straight up looked
like two hanging dicks side by side.

285
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:14,750
In the process of giving birth
to one baby girl,

286
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,586
my friend became two dudes.

287
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:24,343
You could French braid that shit.
It was like a Star Wars monster.

288
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,489
I mean, women, we're not accustomed

289
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,575
to seeing each other's pussies
in the first place.

290
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,827
It's not like men at the urinal
where you're like,

291
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,330
"Hey, what's up, dude? What's going on?"

292
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,499
holding your dicks
in your hands in front of each other.

293
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,127
We're never just like going
to the bathroom, "What's up, girl?"

294
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,363
holding our pussies, just casual,
"I like your manicure."

295
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,497
I told her
that she had turned into two dudes.

296
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,336
And she started laughing.

297
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:04,341
But then she started
to get also extremely upset.

298
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,470
And she was like,
"Please, do not make me laugh!

299
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,115
Do not make me laugh!"

300
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,726
And then with one hand,
she had to grab a pillow,

301
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,188
and press it against her C-section scar.

302
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,150
And then with the other hand,
she had to...

303
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,363
pinch the dicks together...

304
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,952
To make sure that...

305
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,206
the <i>carne asada </i>wouldn't fall out
of the taco,

306
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,585
And become nachos on the floor.

307
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,970
You see,
this is why women need maternity leave!

308
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,325
Yeah, you'd better pay our ass, too.

309
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,910
My friend couldn't go back to work

310
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,955
with her meat curtains
dragging on the floor

311
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,998
like the train of a sad-ass wedding dress.

312
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,691
You can't litigate like that.

313
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,153
Ain't no Spanx gonna tuck that shit in.

314
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,580
I told her all of that too,
and she started laughing more.

315
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:20,625
And, you know, she was like,
she was pinching

316
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,564
and she was pressing,
and repressing the laughter

317
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,173
and it got to be too much,

318
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,111
and then all of this gas
gurgled up in her system,

319
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:33,948
and she let out this fat-ass queef
that dried out my eyeballs.

320
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,223
I was like...

321
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,851
Oh!

322
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,769
Ah!

323
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,232
Oh!

324
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,334
Eeee.

325
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,549
Ah. Ah. Ah.

326
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,531
Many benefits to a C-section, okay?

327
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:37,118
Catheter, I had never had a catheter in my life. A
catheter is a tube that they hook up to your pee-pee hole,

328
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,000
and you just lie there...

329
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:51,424
And then all of a sudden, this bag of piss
shows up next to your bed.

330
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,530
And then this kind Filipino lady

331
00:25:55,554 --> 00:26:00,701
named Joyabelle Esperanza
Purificacion Santo Domingo Ordonez Balasa

332
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,185
comes in to take it out.

333
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,916
And you're like,
"Nurse Joyabelle, whose piss that?"

334
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,650
And she's like, "That's yours."

335
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,153
And you're like, "Oh my God, that's mine?"

336
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,590
I did not even feel it go out.

337
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,842
The catheter, it just carries it out.

338
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,386
And I was like, "Oh my God,

339
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,330
in my life I could have accomplished
so much more

340
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,459
had I had a catheter attached to me
this entire time."

341
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,154
A lot of people like to ask me,

342
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,364
"Ali,

343
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:44,269
how on Earth do you balance
family and career?"

344
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:49,774
Men never get asked that question...

345
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,736
because they don't.

346
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:05,266
They just neglect the child
for like 90% of the day,

347
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,102
and that's perfectly socially acceptable,

348
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:12,273
but the standards for dads are so low

349
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,051
that they get so much praise
for doing so little.

350
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:22,349
My husband occasionally changes diapers,
and when people hear that,

351
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,186
"Oh my God," confetti everywhere!

352
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,732
"I cannot believe
that your husband changes diapers!

353
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:35,028
What a doting modern father. Lucky you!"

354
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,843
When my baby girl was first born<i>,</i>

355
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:45,580
I would do skin-on-skin contact every day
to bond with her.

356
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,628
She shit on my chest.

357
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,473
Where's my confetti at?

358
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,904
I'll tell you how I balance
family and career, real talk?

359
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,033
I have a nanny.
That's it, that's the answer.

360
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:28,015
Yes, it's very unlikable and unpopular
to broadcast that

361
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,477
because not everybody can afford a nanny.

362
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,396
It's super expensive.

363
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,065
It's expensive for me and my husband,

364
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:40,319
so the both of us, we have to hustle,
we have to work very hard

365
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,430
to not take care of our child ourselves.

366
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:52,081
I'm all about putting the oxygen mask
on myself before I put it on my baby.

367
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,775
I like that protocol.
I like that philosophy very much.

368
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,632
When the stewardess tells me
to make sure to do that,

369
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,867
I'm always like,
"Yeah, I was gonna do that.

370
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,620
I got no problem with that."

371
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,794
I'm so jealous of Mexican people.

372
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,838
Mexican culture.

373
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,150
They don't need no nannies,

374
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,342
'cause you know who takes care
of the baby?

375
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,303
The other baby!

376
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:31,328
Hermana, Tía, Abuela, Sobrina, Prima,

377
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:34,397
Second Prima, Bounce House...

378
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,442
The baby is just born into childcare.

379
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,006
I want to be Mexican in my next life.

380
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,009
Don't nobody have more fun than Mexicans.

381
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,077
I used to live at Crenshaw and Pico,

382
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,347
yes, if you don't know,

383
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:55,227
Crenshaw and Pico is this magical corner
in the hood of Los Angeles

384
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,379
where Guadalajara meets Korea...

385
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:07,198
And the Mexicans and the Koreans
are in constant racial warfare,

386
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:11,309
and their weapons are loud music
versus frowning.

387
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:23,798
Mexicans know
how to prioritize family and fun.

388
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,593
They take their kids to Disneyland
all the time.

389
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,220
And now to accommodate,

390
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,890
there is all of this Spanish
at Disneyland.

391
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:37,978
Every ride begins with,
"Ladies and gentlemen, for your safety

392
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:42,507
please keep your arms and hands
inside the vehicle at all times.

393
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,904
Damas y caballeros, por favor

394
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,557
mantengan las manos y los Brazos
dentro Del coche,

395
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:53,226
and please do not smoke...

396
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,605
Because it is gross and dangerous, okay?

397
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:03,820
And employees must wash hands
before returning to work.

398
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,827
Okay, be careful. Be very careful.
Cos tongue taco, son of a bitch, apple!

399
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:19,836
<i>♪ Late at night
When all the world is sleeping ♪</i>

400
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,134
Yes, that's how Mexican
Disneyland has gotten,

401
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,470
they play Selena
on Pirates of the Caribbean.

402
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,310
The Haunted Mansion is now called
Dia de los Muertos!

403
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,291
And what was formerly known
as Splash Mountain

404
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:42,734
is now Esplash Mountain.

405
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:55,663
Our nanny is 62 years old.

406
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:01,145
Yes, I would never accept anything younger

407
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,380
than 62 years old.

408
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:15,808
If you are hiring a 25-year-old
pretty young thing to be your nanny,

409
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,353
you a dumb-ass.

410
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,168
Do you not read <i>People</i> magazine?
You don't know what's up?

411
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,986
That's inviting a marriage grenade
into your home.

412
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,716
When you have a newborn baby,

413
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,219
your marriage is very weak
because you're both stressed out,

414
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,805
you look like shit
'cause you don't shower no more,

415
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,766
you're resentful of each other,

416
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,834
whose idea was it to bring
this new roommate into the world?

417
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:50,134
Your marriage is very vulnerable and easy
for an outsider to invade and colonize.

418
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:58,184
If we had hired a 25-year-old man,

419
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,644
who was...

420
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:03,815
not ugly...

421
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,926
Great with my daughter
and said yes immediately

422
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,788
to every chore I asked him to do
with a positive attitude,

423
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,210
Oh, you best believe

424
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,715
that I would eat the shit
out of his butthole.

425
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:33,946
Every day.

426
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,866
Every day would be an all-day
nanny butthole buffet.

427
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,159
I don't care

428
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:42,246
if his 25 year old butt cheeks
got all nervous

429
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,874
and clenched up and closed on my face
like elevator doors,

430
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,191
I would get in there and...

431
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,994
Like Jack Nicholson in <i>The Shining</i>!

432
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:21,493
A lot of people also often ask me,

433
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:28,024
"Ali, what on Earth do your parents think
about your stand-up comedy?"

434
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:35,674
Now that's a very racilly-charged
question, right?

435
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,658
Like, what they're really asking is,

436
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:42,973
"What do your oppressive Asian parents
who beat you with the SAT book

437
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:46,143
until your fingers bled
from playing the cello

438
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,544
think about your butthole-licking jokes?"

439
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:59,847
My older sister is an unemployed lesbian
who lives on my mother's property.

440
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:05,394
So I can do whatever I want.

441
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,981
Yeah. Whatever I want!

442
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,464
I could take a shit on this stage
right now,

443
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:20,326
and my mom would be like,
"You bring so much honor to our family.

444
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,666
I am so proud of you, my golden child."

445
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:39,345
And then a lot of people also seem
to wonder, "Ali,

446
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:44,392
now that you have a daughter,
are you gonna tone it down?"

447
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:50,898
Here's the thing,
just because you became a parent,

448
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,193
doesn't mean you grew up.

449
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:57,446
Yeah.

450
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,032
Broey dudes become broey dads.

451
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,287
I'm the same piece of shit
that I always was before I became a mom,

452
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:09,250
now just with more responsibility,
and I'm barely rising to the occasion.

453
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,731
And I'm not ashamed,

454
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,150
I'm not going to hide

455
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,343
that I was very sexually active
in my twenties.

456
00:36:19,635 --> 00:36:23,907
You know why?
Because everybody knows the secret now

457
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:28,019
that when a woman sleeps
with a man right away,

458
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,732
it's not because
we don't respect ourselves,

459
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,570
it's because we don't respect you.

460
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,056
We don't see you as marriage material.

461
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,875
That's why we let your dick inside
so fast.

462
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,644
By letting you in,

463
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:54,938
we're really kicking you out
of our future.

464
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,757
"Bye, Felicia,
be on your merry little way."

465
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,474
We're just trying to have fun,
we're not trying to trap your ass.

466
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,228
But...

467
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,982
But you better be careful
because when a man...

468
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:20,714
When a man doesn't sleep with you
right away,

469
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,739
oh...

470
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,160
oh, it's not because he respects you,

471
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,667
it's because he has a small dick.

472
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:44,095
And he's trying to trap you.

473
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,080
Do not fall for that trap.

474
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:57,441
I'm gonna repeat that shit to my daughter
over and over and over again.

475
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,295
Do not fall for that trap.

476
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,297
I fell for that shit once,

477
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:06,301
fell in love
and into a semi long-term relationship

478
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:10,389
with a man who kept on wanting to wait
to have sex,

479
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,474
and I assumed it was because he thought

480
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:16,478
I was so special, and amazing,
and worth waiting for...

481
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,504
He was hiding something!

482
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,652
Months later
he finally agrees to get busy

483
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,905
and unveils this tiny mess of a thing

484
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,266
that wouldn't even reach your molars.

485
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:45,948
It was a black dude.

486
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,806
Creepy, right?
Like seeing a homeless Asian person,

487
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,081
"What happened to you?"

488
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,421
"Oh my God, who are your parents? Truly!"

489
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,406
It was a black dude,
and I told all my black friends about it,

490
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,682
and they were like,
"Where the fuck is he at?

491
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:16,479
We need to assassinate him right now

492
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,399
before he further threatens
to tarnish our sacred reputation!"

493
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,511
It was the first and last time

494
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:35,706
I had ever seen an actual micropenis.

495
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,878
And my honest first reaction
when I saw it was...

496
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:43,589
"Oh, my God, are you okay?

497
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,694
What happened,
did you just get hit by a bus?

498
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:52,407
Did a car outside
just like sideswipe your dick off,

499
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:57,704
and now is your dick rolling around
on the street like a severed snake head?

500
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,624
And should we get a mason jar
and just scoop it up,

501
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,652
and bring you both to the hospital
to have you sewed back together?

502
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,618
Wait a minute. Wait a minute...

503
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,288
Is this some sort
of <i>Princess and the Frog</i> test?

504
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:21,460
Did a witch curse you a long time ago

505
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,046
as punishment for calling her ugly?

506
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,801
And now if I put that in my mouth
to prove that I love you,

507
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,140
As a reward for my love,

508
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,142
will it expand?

509
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,398
Like one of those magic towels
you pour water on?"

510
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:53,301
My life has changed dramatically

511
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:55,870
in the past year,

512
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,080
because a year ago,

513
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,584
nobody knew who the fuck I was.

514
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,855
And when I was warming up

515
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,358
to tape my very first
stand-up comedy special

516
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,886
I did four shows in my hometown,
San Francisco.

517
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,056
And I was so excited, I was super pumped.

518
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,102
And then I couldn't sell out
all the tickets,

519
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,689
so they had to put half of them up on Groupon. I know a
lot of you are having a Chinese heart attack right now.

520
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,073
"Oh my God...

521
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,369
You mean to tell me I could've
seen this bitch a year ago for $10?"

522
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,069
Look, I love Groupon, okay?

523
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,406
But it was so depressing and demoralizing

524
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,850
to see my face and my picture next to...

525
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,936
whale watching tours,

526
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:07,316
Teeth whitening services,
and discontinued dildos on clearance.

527
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,653
I was like, "This is sad."

528
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:15,491
And then fast forward to last year,

529
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:20,287
my Netflix special <i>Baby Cobra</i> premiered
Mother's Day weekend.

530
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,855
And it was crazy,

531
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:32,108
nothing like that
had ever happened to me before.

532
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:36,947
All of a sudden scalpers were charging
up to $1,000 a ticket

533
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,657
to see me headline live.

534
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,202
Over 300 people dressed up as me
while I was pregnant

535
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,353
in that striped dress for Halloween.

536
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,275
And I was so happy.

537
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:55,239
Until I realized that I have no interest
in being famous. I don't.

538
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,867
All I ever wanted was more money
for less effort.

539
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,914
I just wanna collect checks in my pajamas.

540
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:09,712
Play a piece of tofu
in a Pixar movie or something.

541
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:19,072
Yeah, come on, you see it,
the tofu's got glasses,

542
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,973
a lot of attitude,

543
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:26,645
Sings some song about the joy of soy
with Justin Timberlake.

544
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:32,276
My arch nemesis can be a piece of beef
played by Idris Elba,

545
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,487
Named Stringer Beef or something.

546
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:45,473
I'm not even that famous
and already I hate it.

547
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,058
I hate it so much.

548
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,334
It's a burden!

549
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:53,064
Occasionally now,
I will be eating at a fancy restaurant

550
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,901
and will get recognized
by both the wait staff and the chef

551
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,135
and think to myself,

552
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:02,473
"Oh, great. Now I have to tip more."

553
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,669
And I do have more money now,

554
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:19,948
and now I make a lot more money
than my husband by like a long shot.

555
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,770
Well, my mom is very concerned

556
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,255
that he's going to leave me
out of intimidation.

557
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,444
I had to explain to her that

558
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,488
the only kind of man

559
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,973
that would leave a woman
who makes more money,

560
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:50,270
is the kind of man
that doesn't like free money.

561
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,004
"Oh, but Ali, he doesn't feel small?"

562
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,323
He's too busy living large
on my new salary!

563
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,803
"Oh. Oh...

564
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,973
Oh, but Ali, doesn't he feel
like you took something away from him?"

565
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:12,084
Oh, do you mean
like the pressure to provide?

566
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,481
Which I have lifted from his shoulders.
He's chilling.

567
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:21,027
He walks into work now every day
two hours late like this,

568
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,052
"Fuck you!

569
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,938
Fuck you, fuck you, and fuck you!

570
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,650
Fire me, I don't give a shit.
My wife's rich, bitch.

571
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,320
Yeah!

572
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:52,249
Yeah, this job is just an eccentric hobby
for me now."

573
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,469
It was not supposed to go down like this.

574
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:07,055
Okay? I was supposed to be him.

575
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,659
I'm supposed to be the one chilling.

576
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:13,353
He graduated from Harvard Business School.

577
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:17,357
I have a BA from UCLA in Ethnic Studies.

578
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:26,760
Ethnic studies is a major where you study
how to blame everything on white people,

579
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,119
it's not supposed to yield income.

580
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:39,004
Nobody, no one could have predicted
this outcome.

581
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,216
So much so,
that before we got married,

582
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,636
his family made me sign a prenup.

583
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,558
It's true, and now if we get divorced,

584
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,020
their son is fucked.

585
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,242
No more sashimi on a Tuesday!

586
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:14,057
No more fancy Japanese toilet bidet
where water comes out

587
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,334
and Hello Kitty sings the song
until your butthole's fresh and clean.

588
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:21,463
Go back to drinking flat water, bitch!

589
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:38,164
It is said that
if you earn more in the relationship,

590
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:40,524
then you are the breadwinner.

591
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,528
I think my husband's the real breadwinner,

592
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,240
because he won a bread machine.

593
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,813
Being a woman and the breadwinner
is not all that, okay?

594
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,439
Because you get insecure,

595
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,900
you do, about having too much power,

596
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:08,862
so then you overcompensate
in the marriage

597
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,555
by letting the husband have a say and...

598
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,500
And then on top of that, you know,
I get very insecure

599
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:26,129
as being seen as like
an ice cold, workaholic mom,

600
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,573
so then I'm the main caregiver
of our daughter, too.

601
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,701
And I'm exhausted! I'm overwhelmed!

602
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,455
So now when my husband and I role play,

603
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:40,876
I request that he call me "a simple ho".

604
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:49,927
Because that is my greatest fantasy,

605
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:53,722
To be an illiterate farm girl,

606
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,852
With no responsibility
or decision-making power.

607
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,831
We'll get really into it, too.

608
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:06,860
He'll be like, "You!
You are nothing but a simple ho!"

609
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:09,339
And I'm like, "Yeah, I'm a real dummy.

610
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,926
I don't know the alphabet,
I don't know how to count,

611
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,328
I don't know the difference
between shapes and colors.

612
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:21,083
I can't be trusted to deposit checks
or do anything important,

613
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,294
for I am just a simple ho."

614
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:38,451
Despite having more money,
I keep it real, okay?

615
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:43,397
I am still a Chinese-Vietnamese person,
okay? Yeah.

616
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:49,152
I literally watch my Netflix special
on my sister-in-law's login.

617
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,829
To this day, I do not have my own account.

618
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,393
After I filmed <i>Baby Cobra</i>,

619
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:07,897
Netflix sent me a Netflix baby onesie
and a basket.

620
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:10,775
You know those baskets
that white people like to give

621
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:15,029
with the biscotti, and the cheese,
and the caramel popcorn,

622
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:19,391
and all the other shit that Asian people
have no interest in whatsoever.

623
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,103
I was like, "Give me an account!

624
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,525
I don't need this shit that
I'm allergic to, give me an account!"

625
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:40,388
I still buy all my shit on Craigslist,
nothing in my house is new.

626
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:43,891
But now, I have to go in a disguise

627
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:48,503
because last week
I forgot my sunglasses and my hat

628
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,215
and I was haggling with this dude
over a bike helmet.

629
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,345
He was like, "Twenty." I was like, "Ten."

630
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,949
He was like, "Okay, 17."

631
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,893
I was like,
"Uh-uh, I see a scratch on there. Ten."

632
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,581
And finally he says to me,

633
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:09,191
"Um, you know, I could swear, I...

634
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,027
Aren't you Ali Wong?

635
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:17,699
Why are you haggling with me
over this bike helmet?

636
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,928
I'm a college student
who, as you can see,

637
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:23,663
lives in a studio apartment
with roommates."

638
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,249
I was like...

639
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,215
"Shame on you. We don't all look alike!
Give me that helmet.

640
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,761
Me no speak-a the English!

641
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:44,935
My name is not Ali Wong,
my name is Grace Lee!

642
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,981
I dare you to Google Image Grace Lee.

643
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,193
Your computer will burst into flames!"

644
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:07,225
I make fun of my husband a lot,

645
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:11,128
but the reality is
that he is my best friend.

646
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:13,773
Yes, I'm very serious.

647
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:17,068
I'm very lucky
to have gotten to marry my best friend,

648
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:20,446
and our whole dynamic
confuses my mother

649
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,890
because it's the inverse
of what she had with my father.

650
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:28,019
She was like,
"Your father was not my best friend.

651
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:34,067
I cannot believe how comfortable
you guys are around each other.

652
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,239
Do you fart in front of your husband?"

653
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,162
I fart in my husband.

654
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:57,048
'Cause we are best friends.

655
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:05,908
I hope that he and I always stay together,
truly, you know?

656
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:09,269
'Cause a lot of times
when comedians get successful,

657
00:53:09,644 --> 00:53:13,416
they inevitably get divorced
from their first spouse,

658
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,504
and then at the age of, like, 50 or 60,
they like to trade up for a new one

659
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,655
that's, like, a third of their age.

660
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:25,535
As a woman, that has zero appeal to me.

661
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:29,289
You think I wanna fuck an 18-year-old boy
when I'm on the precipice of menopause?

662
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:40,193
Have some nervous teenager do three pumps
and then bust a nut in my old-ass pussy?

663
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,343
No, thank you.

664
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,720
No <i>gracias</i>.

665
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:49,410
I don't wanna fuck an 18-year-old boy<i>,</i>
not now, not ever again,

666
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,788
because they're 18,
they're terrible in bed.

667
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:55,458
Do you remember
when we were all teenagers?

668
00:53:55,482 --> 00:54:01,130
It was horrible for teenage girls
because oral sex was all one-way.

669
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,632
As a teenage girl,

670
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:07,511
you never ever got your pussy eaten,
but you sucked so many dicks.

671
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:12,290
You'd suck a dick under a bridge,
in the bathroom, in the forest.

672
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,230
But as a teenage girl,

673
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:20,483
you never just casually got your pussy
eaten behind the bleachers,

674
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,217
"Come on, Gary. Come on...

675
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:26,322
Come on, Gary. Come on.
Just lie down on your back, Gary.

676
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:30,058
Come on, like you're gonna change oil.
Come on, Gary!"

677
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,667
"Did you see that wicked serve I made
in that tennis match?

678
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,460
Come on, Elliot, come on.

679
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,487
Congratulations to me!
Come on, Elliot.

680
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,156
Come on, Elliot.

681
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,075
Come on."

682
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,392
"There are no more children
in this playground.

683
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,686
Come on, Spencer. Come on!

684
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,921
It's dark, Spencer, come on!"

685
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:12,743
You had to, like, wait until your 20s
to get your pussy eaten,

686
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:17,415
and even then it was not very good
because it's very personal.

687
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,417
Do you know how long it took me

688
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,111
to train my husband
to eat my pussy correctly?

689
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,674
I'm not going back out into the world,

690
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,576
find somebody new to coach all over again.

691
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:31,470
It's too much work.

692
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,974
All of that knowledge
that my husband has now,

693
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,809
all that time I invested,

694
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:40,604
all of that muscle memory
lives and dies with him.

695
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,607
You can't store that
in some sort of I-pussy cloud

696
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:46,694
and then just download it
to a new husband 2.0.

697
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:48,219
He is bespoke to me.

698
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,388
Irreplaceable!

699
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:53,183
Yes.

700
00:55:56,728 --> 00:56:01,125
Look, many patient nights
I wanted to fake it, okay?

701
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:06,130
But I knew that it was so fundamental
for the long-term that he get it right,

702
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:11,409
and that lying to him
would just be cheating myself.

703
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,181
And so, I would shove his head down there

704
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,833
and keep it down there
until his face got prunie.

705
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:27,902
Many nights, he'd enter 7:00 p.m.
looking like a 30-year-old man,

706
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,012
exit hours later
looking like Tommy Lee Jones.

707
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,329
You know how hard it is
for a young Asian man

708
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,314
to suddenly transform
into Tommy Lee Jones?

709
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,255
I think a big part
of being good at eating pussy

710
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:51,217
is that you just got to be into it, okay?

711
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:54,220
Do it with gusto, with enthusiasm.

712
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,473
It's a privilege,
so act like you know, okay?

713
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,208
Yes! Yeah, don't hesitate. Don't...

714
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,140
Like you're some toddler
being forced to eat broccoli.

715
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,143
Get in there!

716
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,996
And hold your own goddamn head up, too,

717
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:23,773
don't use my thigh as a tripod
and just...

718
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,415
Fall into a food coma
before you finish your meal.

719
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,652
Lately, I have been ruminating a lot

720
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,180
over this one time
I hooked up with this dude<i>,</i>

721
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,534
and in the middle of kissing,

722
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:02,437
I felt the responsibility to stop and say<i>,</i>

723
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:03,938
"Hey,

724
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:09,819
I should really let you know now
before we go any further that...

725
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,238
I'm on my period."

726
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,367
And he was like, "Oh...

727
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:18,244
Well...

728
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:22,373
Then let's make a fucking mess, Ali!"

729
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,324
To this day,

730
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:42,352
that is the most romantic thing.

731
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:47,023
Anybody has ever said to me.

732
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:53,506
I think about it when I feel down
and ugly and no good.

733
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:57,784
All I have to do is remember that there was once a man out there who
was willing to yank out my tampon and replace it with his dick!

734
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,058
It made me feel beautiful.

735
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,208
Beautiful!

736
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,753
(cheers and applause.

737
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,859
There is nothing more empowering
and truly feminist

738
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:16,195
than what that man said that day.

739
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,888
That is straight up hashtag...
I'm with her.

740
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:34,421
You know, I think I used to be
a much different comic

741
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,423
before I had the baby.

742
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,885
I used to do a lot more jokes

743
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:43,121
about sucking dick

744
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:46,708
and my pussy, but now...

745
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:51,421
not as many jokes about...

746
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:54,382
Sucking dick

747
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:57,719
and my pussy because...

748
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:01,514
I don't suck dick no more.

749
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,745
When you give birth to a baby,

750
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:10,916
they hand you a diploma
that says, "Congratulations,

751
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,777
you've earned the right to not suck dick
out of obligation anymore."

752
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:21,451
If my husband were to demand
that I suck his dick,

753
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,079
I would laugh in his face.

754
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,186
And then I would go to sleep,
and guess what?

755
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,339
In the morning, he's still there,
ain't no consequence.

756
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:38,777
We're handcuffed together
by a baby and a mortgage.

757
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,738
Checkmate, bitch. It's over.

758
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:42,680
You ain't got nowhere to run.

759
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:46,893
I don't gotta suck your dick anymore,
you owe me money.

760
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,423
And I don't do as many jokes
about my pussy anymore

761
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:00,948
because my pussy...

762
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:02,992
is gone.

763
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:04,970
It's gone.

764
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:09,099
Physically it's quite intact
because I had the C-section,

765
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:12,293
but emotionally and spiritually...

766
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,297
<i>Ghost in the Shell.</i>

767
01:01:17,757 --> 01:01:19,735
<i>Ghost in the Shell,</i>

768
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:23,304
it's an Asian character being played
by Scarlett Johansson!

769
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,575
Yeah.

770
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,661
My husband and I,
we don't fuck no more.

771
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,496
We just jack off side-by-side

772
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,772
while we fantasize
about Puerto Rican people.

773
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,378
I don't have the energy
to climb on top of him,

774
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,754
clean up after sex,

775
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,990
put that towel on the bed
to absorb that post-sex wet spot.

776
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:48,079
You know, that perfectly round-ass
wet spot on the bed

777
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,915
that gets all cold in the winter time.

778
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,545
It's like an ice fishing hole.

779
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,966
Because it smells like penguins.

780
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:04,721
And is narrated by Morgan Freeman.

781
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:07,807
All right, I've been Ali Wong.
Have a good night, everybody. Thank you!
