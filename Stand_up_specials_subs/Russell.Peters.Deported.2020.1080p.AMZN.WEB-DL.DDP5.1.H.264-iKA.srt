at the Dome NSCI SVP Stadium.

00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,800
And right about now, we're going
to bring you the brother that

00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,520
gave you, "somebody going to get
a hurt real bad," "be a man,"

"take it and go."

00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,720
Hey!

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello Bombay buggers.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
What's happening?

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,360
I know it's going
to sound strange,

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
but it's good to be home.

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,160
I mean, although I was
never born and raised here,

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,120
but I still feel at home.

21
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,640
I feel like I don't
have to do things

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,040
that I have to do back home
to keep up with white people.

23
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,640
I can just be a
comfortable brown man here.

24
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,200
Fuck it, I don't even have to
put on deodorant over here if I

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,920
don't want to, because
it's not stopping you,

How you doing, buddy?

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,760
You OK?

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,600
He must be good.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,600
He give me, like, the sharp one.

35
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,000
That's how you know you're
really fucking good.

36
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,560
It wasn't even

00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,680

That sounds like before ugly.

You chose to look
like a sperm tonight.

45
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,760
I see that was your...

46
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,920
That was a choice you made.

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,360

That's why traffic
doesn't bother him.

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,800
I was around a million others.

52
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,680
That's an awful outfit.

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,240

[LAUGHTER]

55
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,880
OK, let me tell you
what's been happening

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,880
with me since the last
time I saw you guys.

57
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,160
I don't know if you know
this, it's been a few years

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,960
since I've been here.

59
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,560
But since the last time
I was here, I got fat.

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,200
And... fuck you.

61
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,800
I... here's what happened, I was
like my regular kind of fat.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,640
You know what I mean?

63
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,400
Like, that kind of fat
when you look at me

64
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,920
and you go, you
know, Russell, if you

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,240
would just run, like, once.

66
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,480
That's the problem with
being Indian, we get fat.

67
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,880
We're born skinny,
that's the real problem.

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,800
We're born skinny.

69
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,280
We're naturally a
skinny race of people.

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,520
And we're born skinny
and we stay skinny.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,280
We don't have to work
hard to be skinny.

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
We could be skinny and
eat whatever we want

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,200
and stay skinny.

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,400
And then we never go to the
gym because we're skinny,

75
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,240
we don't need to.

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,176
And our parents don't
encourage you to go to the gym.

77
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,960
You're like, dad, I'm
going to go to the gym.

78
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,760
What's in the gym?

79
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,440
Do they have studies in the gym?
No, you're not going to the gym.

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
You stay home and
do your studies.

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,920
And because you
never tone up, you

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,920
stay this, like, really smushy
kind of skinny, you know.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,880
And you eat whatever you
want your entire life.

84
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,560
And then at 30, you're
Indian genes kick

85
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,000
in and go, OK, party's over.

86
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,280
And then you just get fat,
and it's, like, a fucking

87
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,280
awful fat that we get.

88
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,600
And that's what happened to me.

89
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,320
I mean, I'm much
older than that now.

90
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,840
But I got like a
weird kind of fat.

91
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,200
I was like my normal fat and
then I woke up one morning,

92
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
I was like, [POOF].

93
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,760
I was like, I'm bloated.

94
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,800
I figured I would pee it
out, I would sweat it out,

95
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,040
I'd be fine the next day.

96
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,760
Anyway, cut to a year and a
half later and I'm still [POOF]..

97
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,040
And I go, something's wrong.

98
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,960
So I go to the doctor.

99
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,720
I go, doc, I got fat.

100
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
He goes, yes.

101
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,000
I said, thanks, asshole.

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,760
I didn't come here
for confirmation.

103
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,960
I came here to find
out why I got fat.

104
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,280
He goes, well, why do
you think you're fat?

105
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,480
I said, because I have a mirror.

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,160
And I walked past it
naked the other day

107
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,480
and I thought somebody
else was in my room.

108
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,960
I was like, on my God, who
fat, hairy ass is that?

109
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,280
Turns out it was my stomach.

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
It was...

111
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,360
And people on the internet
were calling me fat.

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,840
You guys are dicks, by the way.

113
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,840
You say whatever you want
to us on the internet.

114
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,640
And if we respond,
we're assholes.

115
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,200
So we just have
to take the abuse.

116
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,840
But sometimes I get
mad when people say

117
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,080
things to me on the internet.

118
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,560
Not because of what they said,
more so because it's probably

119
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
something I would have said.

120
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
And then I'm mad
that my own words

121
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,160
are getting used against me.

122
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,440
Like, I posted something
for this TV show I was on.

123
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,520
And somebody goes, holy shit,
did you eat your whole cast?

124
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,640
And I was like, damn it,
I would have said that to.

125
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
I probably would
have said that too.

126
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,760
And then somebody posted
a picture with me,

127
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,760
and somebody commented
and went, Russell Peters,

128
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,760
looking thicker than a snicker.

129
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,680
I got mad at that because
I love a good rhyme.

130
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,960
Thicker than a snicker,
that's a good one too.

131
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,680
It's not a fair way
to describe a human.

132
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,560
I think thicker than a
snicker is a great way

133
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,736
for me to describe my penis.

134
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,520
I think it's a wonderful
way to describe it.

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,040
So Russell, tell me
about your penis.

136
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Well, it's thicker than
a snicker, equally dark

137
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:25,600
and vain texture, packed
with nuts, and it satisfies.

138
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,600
[LAUGHTER]

139
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,120
So I said to my
doc, I said, doc,

140
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,720
it doesn't make sense
that I should be

141
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,080
getting as fat as I'm getting.

142
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:35,880
He said, why not?

143
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,880
I said, because I
don't eat crazy,

144
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,160
and I train jujitsu
every other day.

145
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,560
He's like, huh, how
old are you now?

146
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,520
I said, 48.

147
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,680
He goes, and you're Indian?

148
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,600
I go, yeah, but...

149
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
He goes, and you haven't
had a heart attack yet?

150
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,560
He goes... I said, no, I
haven't had a heart attack yet.

151
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,520
He goes, all right.

152
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,560
So he takes blood and I leave.

153
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,736
Calls me back in
three days later.

154
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,536
I go back in, he's like,
hey, I got your blood back.

155
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,120
I know what's wrong.
I go, what's wrong?

156
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
He goes, it's your thyroid.

157
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,240
I go, what about it?

158
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,080
He goes, you have an
underactive thyroid.

159
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,520
I go, so what does that mean?

160
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,640
It means it's not doing enough.

161
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,800
I said, I understand what
the fuck underactive means.

162
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,040
He goes, then why did you ask?

163
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,360
I said, how is it affecting me?

164
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,960
He goes, the thyroid
is making you fat.

165
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,760
I go, the thyroid
is making me fat.

166
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,280
He goes, no, you're
doing things too,

167
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
but the thyroid
is really helping.

168
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,120
I go, so what do we got to do?

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,960
He said, we've got to
speed your thyroid up.

170
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,440
I said, let's get that
bitch moving, right.

171
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,040
So it's been a
year and a half now

172
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,080
and I lost 24 pounds from it.

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,800
But it wasn't me, it
was the medication.

174
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,920
It's not me.

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,040
And I've lost... like my
body's in much better shape

176
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,160
than it's ever been, but my
fucking head is fat as shit.

177
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,320
And I don't know...

178
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,280
I don't know how to...

179
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,320
I look like a fucking thumb.

180
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,800
[LAUGHTER]

181
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,560
Do you know how hard it
is to lose a fat head?

182
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,920
It's almost impossible.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,720
I used to box.

184
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,440
There's tricks when
you want to lose weight

185
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,240
from your body in boxing, you
could put on a garbage bag

186
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,280
and you go sit in the
sauna and you sweat it off.

187
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,880
Let me give you some
friendly advice,

188
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,000
you can't do that
with your head.

189
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,200
I know, I found
out the hard way.

190
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,800
I was like, you know
what, I got this.

191
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,680
I grabbed a plastic bag, I threw
it over my big stupid head.

192
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,240
I'm not an idiot, I cut
a hole from my nose.

193
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,720
It was a substantial hole.

194
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
And I went sat in the sauna.

195
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,520
But I forgot when you have a
larger nose and you inhale,

196
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,640
you tend to suck up more
than the average human.

197
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,320
And I took a deep
breath in the sauna

198
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,920
and sucked up the plastic bag.

199
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,120
And my friends thought I
was trying to commit suicide

200
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,320
in the dumbest way possible.

201
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,640
But when I got fat, I
got like a weird kind.

202
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,440
Indian people, we get
the worst kind of fat.

203
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,080
Like, it just goes everywhere.

204
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,640
Like, white people,
do you ever see

205
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,696
white Americans when they get
fat, it's just bam, a belly.

206
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,080
And you can't tell from behind.
Hey, look at the white guy.

207
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
He turns around
and, like, hello.

208
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,800
But Indians, it just shows
up in the weirdest places.

209
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,240
Like, I started to grow tits,
but not in front, on the side.

210
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,320
I don't know what the fuck
they were going, but...

211
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,120
[LAUGHTER]

212
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,760
I was growing side tits and
they were like arm rests.

213
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,000
I was walking around
after a while, I was...

214
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,560
It was like I was going to go
into a pool with some floaties

215
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,920
on the whole time.

216
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,080
And then I was
getting a fat back.

217
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,320
That was a weird thing to get.

218
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,680
It was like fat on my back.

219
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,856
I would sit down and my fat back
would hang over the chair and.

220
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,800
I'm like, what the fu...

221
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,440
I would grab it and
go, this feels nice.

222
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,520
But not on me, I
don't like this.

223
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
And then I had a chunk of fat,
like a big... like, right here...

224
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,040
A big, huge clump of fat.

225
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,720
Like, when a woman gets fat
here, it's called a gunt.

226
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,280
Because it's a gut
right above her...

227
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,280
You know I mean.

228
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,400
So it's a gunt.

229
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,240
And I guess when I
had it, it's a gock.

230
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,760
I guess it would
be a gock, I guess.

231
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I don't know.

232
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,920
Literally for a year and a
half, I didn't see my penis.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,040
I would have to
lift it up to visit.

234
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,040
You still there, buddy?

235
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,880
OK, good.

236
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,760
And I'd rest it.

237
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,400
Don't worry, the sun
will shine one day.

238
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,840
So my doctor says, hey,
what else is wrong with you?

239
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
I go, what do you mean
what else is wrong with me?

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
He goes, look, you're a
48-year-old Indian man.

241
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,560
I'm like, that's really fucking
racist, but since you asked,

242
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
I have acid reflux.

243
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't know.

244
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,400
Does anybody else... who else
has acid reflux in here?

245
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,200
First of all, you're
lying to me right now.

246
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,960
Because there is no way
you can be Indian and not

247
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,840
have fucking acid reflux.

248
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,200
It's inevitable.

249
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,920
There's no way you can
consume the food that we eat

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,200
with that much spice, and that
much oil, and that much butter,

251
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,240
and not just have it
burn a hole in your...

252
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,120
As my dad would
say... your esophagus.

253
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,920
What?

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,600
Son, it's burning
your esophagus.

255
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,840
Dad, I want to assure you
I have no phagus in me.

256
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,120
No, no, son, esophagus.

257
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't care whose
phagus you think this is.

258
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,800
There's no way you
don't have acid reflux.

259
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,720
I'm looking at all of you,
especially all the pudgy guys.

260
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,240
You know exactly who has it.

261
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,640
You got it, don't
you, yellow guy?

262
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,440
You do, do you.

263
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,920
He's like, I know,
I have it, but I

264
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,760
don't want to say because my
shirt looks like turmeric, so...

265
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
I've had acid reflux
my entire life...

266
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,520
My entire life.

267
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,880
And I remember being
six years old...

268
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,040
And here's the worst thing
about having acid reflux,

269
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,400
it's triggered by food.

270
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,240
And when you grow up
in an Indian house

271
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,200
and your food is Indian
food, and this food triggers

272
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,360
your fucking acid
reflux, and you

273
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,720
can't eat Indian food anymore,
you're a piece of shit.

274
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,280
Like, I remember
going to my mom, mom,

275
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,640
I can't eat Indian food anymore.

276
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
Mom goes, what?

277
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
Do you realize people in
India are dying to eat

278
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,280
this food, literally dying.

279
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,920
I said, mom, do you
understand that I'm

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,080
dying if I eat this food?

281
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Literally dying.

282
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,480
I was six years old, I
remember this clearly,

283
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,920
I was six years
old and I remember

284
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,720
burping and fire
shot up my chest

285
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,280
and flames came out my nose.

286
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,800
And I remember
clearly because there

287
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,080
was tears coming down my eyes.

288
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,200
And I remember going, I'm
crying and I'm not crying,

289
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,160
I'm very confused.

290
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,080
And I go to my mom, I go, mom,
mom, it's burns when I burp.

291
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,400
My mom goes, what?

292
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,960
I said, it burns when I burp.

293
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,440
Oh my God, it burns
when he burps.

294
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,920
Oh my God, son, OK,
do this, don't burp.

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,280
[LAUGHTER]

296
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,880
That was your big
piece of advice, mom?

297
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,376
I'm like, I'm serious,
mom, it's burning.

298
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,440
She goes, OK, OK, yeah,
yeah, here, drink some milk,

299
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,240
drink some milk.

300
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,520
I drank the milk, nothing.

301
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,040
Mom, it's still
burning, never mind.

302
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,640
Dad, dad, it's still burning.

303
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,640
My dad goes, OK, OK, see
the yogurt on the table?

304
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Eat the yogurt.

305
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
What?

306
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,480
Eat the yogurt.

307
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,840
What do you mean eat the yogurt?

308
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,600
Son, it's a fact.

309
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,600
What's a fact?

310
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,480
If you eat the yogurt,
it will cool you down.

311
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,840
You'll feel better.

312
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,600
How is that...

313
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
It's a fact, son.

314
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,560
How is that a fact?

315
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,800
Son, do you even
know what yogurt is?

316
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,360
Yogurt is a probiotic.

317
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,400
When you get sick, what
does the doctor give you?

318
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Antibiotic.

319
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,280
[LAUGHTER]

320
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,840
Dad, I'm six years old.

321
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,960
I don't know what a
fucking biotic is.

322
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,400
Son, one is for biotics
and one is against biotics.

323
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,240
I said, I still don't
know what a biotic is.

324
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,600
Son, just eat the
bastard yogurt.

325
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,680
I go, why?

326
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Because why do you think
Indian people keep yogurt

327
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,080
on the table when we eat food?

328
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,080
To help your digestion.

329
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,600
I said, OK, now
that makes sense.

330
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,240
So I grabbed a
bowl of the yogurt.

331
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,600
I start eating it, Well,
fuck me in the eye,

332
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,320
there's chilies and
onions in the yogurt.

333
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,160
Why?

334
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,440
Why did we spice the yogurt?

335
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,760
That's what triggers
the burning.

336
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,240
And Indian parents will become
racist at the drop of a dime.

337
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,000
I go, dad, why did
we spice the yogurt?

338
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,920
He goes, how else are
you going to eat yogurt?

339
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,160
Plain?

340
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
We're not white people.

341
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,680
I said, dad, that's
really racist.

342
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,480
Is it racist or is it a fact?

343
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,840
How is that a fact?

344
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,040
Son, what color is plain yogurt?

345
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,960
[LAUGHTER]

346
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
What does plain
yogurt taste like?

347
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
Nothing.

348
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,520
What is the contribution
from white people

349
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,080
to the food of the world?

350
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,280
Nothing.

351
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,360
It's a fact.

352
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,840
So my doctor says to me,
hey, I just called downstairs

353
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,800
to the clinic in
the lobby and I got

354
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,720
you an endoscopy appointment.

355
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,520
I go, what?

356
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,760
He goes, when was the last
time you had an endoscopy?

357
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,000
I said, never.

358
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Let me tell you
something, doc, I've never

359
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,360
shoved anything in my ass.

360
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,840
He said, what the fuck
are you talking about?

361
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,520
I said, doc, I'm not
an idiot, all right?

362
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,640
I know what an endoscopy is.

363
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,640
It's in your end -os.

364
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,920
Copy.

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,880
He said, no, you fucking
idiot, it's in your mouth.

366
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,640
I said, hey, yo.

367
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,520
It may be in your mouth, doc,
but it ain't in my mouth, bro.

368
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,600
I mean, what you do outside of
here is none of my business,

369
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
man.

370
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,880
That's why I like my
doctor because he swears

371
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,040
at me when he talks to me.

372
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,280
I trust him for
that reason alone.

373
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,160
I don't trust people
that don't swear.

374
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,136
People that don't swear,
you're hiding something.

375
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,416
There's something
wrong with you.

376
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,360
You probably touch kids.

377
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,760
I'm telling you,
there's something

378
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,440
wrong with people that don't
swear, there's something wrong.

379
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,480
They're hiding something.

380
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,616
And people that don't swear act
like they're better than you.

381
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
Because they go out
of their way to let

382
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,680
you know they don't swear.

383
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,360
I don't know, I just
find better ways

384
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,200
of communicating than using
foul and obscene language.

385
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,600
It's like, [GIBBERISH].

386
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,440
You keep an eye on those people.

387
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
They're hiding some...
There's something really

388
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,240
dark going on in their head.

389
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,720
They've got some
dark, dark secrets

390
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,840
and they don't want
you to know about it.

391
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,640
You see them, the people
that are too nice,

392
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,240
they'll be too friendly,
too polite, you know.

393
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
They got dark stuff
going on in their head.

394
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,680
They'll be like, well, the
wife and I had a lovely dinner

395
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,960
with you all tonight.

396
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,600
We hope you all have a
wonderful night of digestion.

397
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,240
We're going to reconvene to
the bedroom and at which point

398
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,160
in the morning, we'll
collect again and enjoy

399
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,720
a delicious breakfast together.

400
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,120
And at which point we shall
discuss the night's events.

401
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,320
With that, I wish you all good
night and pleasant dreams.

402
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,600
And they go to the bedroom
and he closes the door.

403
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,840
And he's like, all right,
honey, shit on my chest.

404
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:46,720
Because they got dark, dark
things going on in there.

405
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,360
Here's the good news, I swear
I'll never shit on your chest.

406
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,680
I like how uncomfortable
that made all of you.

407
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,200
I'm just trying to do the math
on the shitting on the chest,

408
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,080
it's...

409
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,360
What is the purpose of this?

410
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,360
My doctor says, listen, I
called downstairs to the clinic

411
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,720
in the lobby and I got you
an endoscopy appointment.

412
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,520
I go, when?

413
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
He goes, right now.

414
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,960
I go, so what do I gotta do?

415
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,160
He said, you got to go
downstairs to the lobby

416
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,120
and go to the clinic.

417
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,880
And I go, and when is
this going to happen?

418
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,120
He said, right now.

419
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,680
I said, OK, so where is
this going to happen?

420
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,640
He says, at the
clinic in the lobby.

421
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,640
I go, no, no, on me.

422
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,320
He goes, oh, in your mouth.

423
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,320
I go, so what's going
to happen in my mouth?

424
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,320
He says, they're going
to give you an endoscopy.

425
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,480
I go, and it just takes
place in my mouth?

426
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,280
He goes, yeah.

427
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,160
I go, they're not going to
touch my asshole, are they?

428
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,480
He said, do you want them
to touch your asshole?

429
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,320
No, they're not going
to touch your asshole.

430
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,160
I said, OK, doc, I just want to
confirm that this procedure is

431
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,480
strictly in my mouth.

432
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,760
He goes, that is correct.

433
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,440
I said, OK, I'm going to go.

434
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,560
But I swear to God, doc, if
they try and touch my asshole,

435
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,280
I'm coming back up here
and I'm fucking you up.

436
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
He goes, go, you idiot.

437
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,440
So I go.

438
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,400
Now here's the problem,
my doctor knows me.

439
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,920
He knows what kind
of person I am.

440
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,840
He knows I've been a
comedian for 30 years.

441
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,120
He knows how my brain works.

442
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,680
He knows how I have no filter.

443
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,960
See, comedians look at the
audience, we look at you guys

444
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,280
and go, those are civilians.

445
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,240
You guys are civilians.

446
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,040
You know how to do this,
sit around each other

447
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
and be normal.

448
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,560
Just sit around and go...

449
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,176
I don't... I don't have
that fucking filter.

450
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,336
I have to... as soon you
see... as soon as I walk out...

451
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
[GIBBERISH]

452
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,520
But these people in the clinic
don't know me like that,

453
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
so I can't go in and be me.

454
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,840
So I have to do my
impression of how I think you

455
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,600
would handle this situation.

456
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:43,600
So I walk up to the
clinic and I'm like, hi.

457
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,120
I'm here for my
endoscopy appointment.

458
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
It's in the mouth.

459
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,240
She goes, yes, sir.

460
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,800
We know where it is.

461
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,840
Please come around.

462
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
OK.

463
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,360
So I walk around and she
hands me a hospital gown.

464
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,080
And says, OK, sir,
just go down the hall,

465
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,480
take off your clothes, put
this on, and we'll get started.

466
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:07,760
I said, uh... um, I think
there's a misunderstanding here.

467
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,560
My doctor upstairs, he
told me that this procedure

468
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,400
just takes place in my mouth.

469
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,280
She goes, that's correct.

470
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,736
I go, oh, well, then
hang on to the gown.

471
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,720
Let's just go get started.
She goes, no, no, sir.

472
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,440
You have to... you
can't have your clothes

473
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,760
on when we do this procedure.

474
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,800
I said, that doesn't
make any sense.

475
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,520
Because if it's just my
mouth you need access to...

476
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,600
[AH]

477
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm not fighting you on this.

478
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,400
I'm not even blocking my mouth.
I'm here to help.

479
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,840
Pick a chin, which
one do you like?

480
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,200
I'll hold it down for you.

481
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,600
She's like, sir,
it's policy that

482
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,040
you cannot have
your street clothes

483
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
on when we do this procedure.

484
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,560
I said, you know, it's
funny you should say that,

485
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,160
because I, too, have a policy.

486
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,760
And my policy is that
I like as many layers

487
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,800
as possible protecting
my asshole at all times.

488
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,000
She said, sir, would you just
go put the fucking gown on.

489
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,680
I said, whoa, you swore.

490
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
All right.

491
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,440
So I go down to the change room.

492
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,400
And I'm standing there and
I'm buck ass naked, right?

493
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,920
And I start getting really
paranoid about my ass.

494
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,440
And then I get a brilliant idea.

495
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,720
I take the hospital gown
and I put it on backwards.

496
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Smart, right?

497
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,600
Right?

498
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,480
To protect it.

499
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,040
But then I look down, my dick
is just swinging, just like...

500
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,480
[LAUGHTER]

501
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,440
Look, it's my story,
I'll make my penis as big

502
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,920
as I want it to be, all right?

503
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,360
It's India.

504
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,656
You're all, like, come on, bro.

505
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,440
That's not even believable, OK?

506
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,560
Not even on a humid day.

507
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,280
It's true, it was cold in
there too, you know, I just...

508
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
You know what I mean?

509
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,240
It was embarrassingly small.

510
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,880
It just looked like three
coins and a mushroom cap.

511
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,760
It was just terrible.

512
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,280
It was the worst.

513
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,720
Oh man.

514
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,760
You know what I mean, you
know what I mean, right?

515
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,280
You know what I mean?

516
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,880
Have you ever had it shrivel up
so much that you bend forward

517
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,680
and it inverts.

518
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,280
You're like, hey,
where did my dick go?

519
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,480
You're like dick, no
dick, dick, no dick.

520
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
My black security guys
never get that joke.

521
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,000
I don't get it.

522
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,440
If I bend forward, the
motherfucker hits the floor.

523
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,760
[LAUGHTER]

524
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,520
So I'm like, well,
this is embarrassing,

525
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,000
so I put the gown
on the right way.

526
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,640
And I walk back in the room.

527
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,800
And she goes, all right,
Mr. Peters, just hop up here

528
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,760
and we'll get started.

529
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,240
So I hop up on the
table, but I put

530
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,920
my ass right against the wall.

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,480
Because like I said,
I train jujitsu.

532
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,400
If you want to come at
me when I'm on my back,

533
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,536
it's your funeral, not mine.

534
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,480
And she goes, all right,
sir, just so you know,

535
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,440
during this procedure
we're going to be putting

536
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,760
you under using propofol.

537
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,040
I said, wait, wait
a minute, propofol?

538
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,280
Isn't that the shit that
killed Michael Jackson?

539
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,280
She goes, yes, yes it is.

540
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
I go, what do you
mean, yes, yes it is?

541
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,440
Why are you so happy about this?

542
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
It killed the biggest
pop star of my lifetime

543
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,400
and you think it's
just OK for me to take?

544
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,360
She said, sir, Michael
Jackson was having

545
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,080
an improperly administered.

546
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,000
I said, Michael Jackson
was having many things

547
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,840
improperly administered.

548
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,640
But wasn't his doctor's
name Dr. Conrad Murray?

549
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,440
Yes.

550
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,000
Wasn't he a doctor?

551
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,880
Yes.

552
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,120
Well, what's your title?

553
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,120
I'm an anesthesiologist.

554
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,760
I said, look, I don't care what
your zodiac sign is, all right?

555
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,920
I don't even know
what month that is.

556
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,840
She said, sir, my job is to
make sure you go to sleep

557
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,560
and wake up.

558
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,560
I say, [MOCKING GIBBERISH].

559
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,360
I said that is a fine answer
and I will accept that.

560
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,120
She goes, great.

561
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,520
Please lay on your side.

562
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,440
I said no, no, no.

563
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,040
Why?

564
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,360
Why do I got to lay on my side?

565
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,000
I lay on my side,
you knock me out,

566
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,520
you lift up the dress,
you flip up a butt cheek,

567
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,040
you start stuffing
me like a turkey.

568
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,600
I'm not falling for
this trick, lady.

569
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,496
She said, sir, you need
to lay on your side

570
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,896
because when we give
you the propofol

571
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,200
you're going to pass out and
you're going to fall over.

572
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,200
And when you fall over,
you could hurt yourself.

573
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,160
So to avoid any injury, you need
to already start on your side.

574
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,880
I said, that is a fair answer.

575
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,160
She goes, great.

576
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,040
So I lay on my side,
but I tuck my ass

577
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,840
in real tight on the wall.

578
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,200
And she goes, why don't you
count down from five with us?

579
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
And I go, all right.

580
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,400
Five, four, thwump.

581
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,200
Out cold.

582
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,680
I don't know if any of you've
been put under at the doctor,

583
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,560
but...

584
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,360
Sir, have you been put
under at the doctor?

585
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,360
You're an older gentleman.

586
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,960
I mean, not older, but you know,
you're not these fucking kids,

587
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,840
you know what I mean?

588
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
What's your name?

589
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,600
Sandeep.

590
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,800
And how old are you Sandeep?

591
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,680
48.

592
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,720
48, we're the same age.

593
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,640
Same shit.

594
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,400
And have you been put
under at the doctor?

595
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,680
I got an endoscopy.

596
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,200
RUSSELL PETERS: You
had an endoscopy?

597
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,680
"Endo-scope-y."

598
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,360
He had the "endo-scope-y."

599
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,920
And I had the
endoscopy, so I think...

600
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,480
[LAUGHTER]

601
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,080
Do you know if they gave you
propofol when they put you out?

602
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,880
No.

603
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,616
RUSSELL PETERS: No, they
gave you the cheap shit?

604
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,200
Did they knock you
out when they did it?

605
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,000
AUDIENCE: No.

606
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,840
No?

607
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,560
All right, Sandeep, open wide.

608
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,000
[YELLING]

609
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,800
Really?

610
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,760
You were awake?

611
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,920
Yeah.

612
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,440
Why didn't you spend the extra
$10 and get the fucking med?

613
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,400
[LAUGHTER]

614
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,800
Is it even possible to do
it when somebody is awake?

615
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
Oh my God.

616
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,040
It's ironic because all the
doctors in America are Indian.

617
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,800
[LAUGHTER]

618
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,520
And then in India,
they're like, fuck it,

619
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,160
we don't need all
these fancy tricks.

620
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,240
Open wind, Sandeep.

621
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,360
Were you 1970 or '71?

622
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,560
'71.
RUSSELL PETERS: '71.

623
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,040
So you're a year
younger than me.

624
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,920
But you know what's...

625
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,640
You know what I'm not
looking forward to,

626
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,560
next year I'll be 50.

What the fuck are
you waiting for?

You're 60.

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,880
You gotta get your shit checked.

645
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,840
Here's the thing,
when I turned 40,

646
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,800
it's when you were supposed
to do it back then.

647
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,880
And then for some
reason as I turned 40,

648
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,400
there were like,
no, no, it's 50 now.

649
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,800
And I go, yes.

650
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,920
And I was like, I got 10
years before they're going

651
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
to shove a hand up my ass.

652
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,240
And I figured in that 10
years, they would come up

653
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,480
with some sort of technology.

654
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,080
Because in those 10 years they
got a fucking Rover to Mars.

655
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,480
India's got one circling Mars.

656

shit on the moon.

later, still [AH]..

awake when this shit happened.

how uncomfortable

Let me just too you something
about this propofol shit.

It's incredible.

I get it, Michael, I get it.

665
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,600
It's an amazing drug, and I'm
not a drug guy by any means.

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,560
I'm aware that I sniff a lot.

692
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,160
And I'll tell you
exactly why I sniff.

693
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I used to box.

694
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,000
And when I was boxing,
I broke my nose.

695
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,280
But I didn't know I broke my
nose, so it never got fixed.

696
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,920
And of course I
would've broken my nose.

697
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,160
It's been literally 30 years
since I've broken my nose,

698
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:26,960
but I didn't know.

699
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,936
Because I thought a broken
nose looked like a broken nose.

700
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,520
I thought it was like
the guys in my gym

701
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,000
where there was
nothing then a nub.

702
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,320
And they're like,
what's up, champ?

703
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,120
I didn't know.

704
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,680
I just thought I
was a bleeder when I

705
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,320
would get punched in the face.

706
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,120
Last year is when I found out.

707
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,656
I went to the doctor
last year, because I

708
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,480
was having trouble breathing.

709
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,480
I go, hey, doc, I'm
having trouble breathing.

710
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,720
He goes, what's the problem?

711
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,640
I go, like, one nostril works
and then the other one doesn't.

712
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,360
And then when the other
one stops working,

713
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,800
the other one starts working.

714
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,800
It's like there's
a flap in there.

715
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,960
Like a train, you know, local,
express, local, express.

716
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,600
He goes, have you
ever broke your nose?

717
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,800
I said, no.

718
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,640
He said, you sure?

719
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,080
I said, doc, I'm not an idiot.

720
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,360
Pretty sure I'd know
if I broke my nose.

721
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,440
He said, didn't you
tell me you used to box?

722
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,360
I said, yeah.

723
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,000
He goes, so wait, you used to
box and you never broke that?

724
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
I said, doc, I
never broke my nose.

725
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,160
He goes, wait, hold
on a second, you're

726
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,320
trying to tell me you
were so good at boxing

727
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,440
that you managed to avoid
breaking the biggest

728
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,280
fucking thing on your body?

729
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,200
I say, I'm telling you,
I never broke my nose.

730
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,960
He goes, if you never broke
that fucking nose in boxing,

731
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,160
you should have a 10
world titles by now.

732
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I said, I never broke it.

733
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,920
He goes, lean forward,
you fucking idiot.

734
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,720
So I lean forward.

735
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,200
He goes like this, yeah,
your nose is broken.

736
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,800
I go, how do you know that?

737
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,560
He goes, because I'm a doctor.

738
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,736
Yeah, but how can you tell?

739
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,080
He goes, because
it's not connected.

740
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,520
I go, if it's not connected,
why didn't it fall off?

741
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
He goes, you're a fucking idiot.

742
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,320
He goes, look, nobody's nose
should move around like this.

743
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,920
I shouldn't be able
to move it around,

744
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,560
and double click, and order
shit off Amazon from your face.

745
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,520
This is not a normal nose.

746
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,080
I go, that's a broken nose?

747
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,240
He goes, yeah, what
did you think it was?

748
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,200
OK, don't judge me, all right?

749
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,440
This is actually what
I thought this was.

750
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,440
And understand I've been
a comedian for 30 years

751
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,600
and I have a creative mind.

752
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,600
Here's really what
I thought this was.

753
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,840
You know how humans...

754
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,680
This is how you know
it's going to be dumb...

755
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,640
You know how humans are
an ever evolving species?

756
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,520
Like, if you looked at
humans from 10,000 years ago,

757
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,360
you go, what the
fuck were those?

758
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,800
Well in 10,000 years, those
humans are going to look at us

759
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,160
and go, what the
fuck were those?

760
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:46,880
Well, so because of
evolution and my own ego,

761
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
I thought that I was evolving
at a faster rate than you.

762
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,120
[LAUGHTER]

763
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,560
And that my body, to
accommodate the larger nose,

764
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:02,240
had developed some sort of
joint hinge system in here

765
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,400
to alleviate the weight.

766
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,040
I don't know, I'm not a doctor.

767
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,880
He goes, you're
fucking retarded.

768
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,080
I said, doc, you actually
cannot say that anymore.

769
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,336
What?
That you're fucking retarded?

770
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,240
Yeah, you can't say
retarded anymore, doctor.

771
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,040
No, I can say it.

772
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,776
No, you can't, because
it's offensive to people.

773
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm not talking about anybody
else, I'm talking about you.

774
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,120
You're a fucking retard.

775
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,320
And I go, no, doc, you
can't say retard or retarded

776
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,160
at all anymore.

777
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,056
He goes, I'm not talking about
anybody, I'm talking about you.

778
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,200
And as a matter of fact, I'm
putting it in your notes.

779
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,400
I said, you're putting in
my notes that I'm a retard?

780
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,640
He goes, no, I'm putting
that you're a fucking retard.

781
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,496
He goes, lean forward.
I lean forward.

782
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,776
He goes, let me
show you something.

783
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,120
I lean forward.
He goes like this.

784
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,000
OK, now breathe.

785
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,240
And I go [TAKES BREATH].

786
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,040
Oh, that's amazing.

787
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:41,840
What did you do?

788
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,840
He goes, I attached your nose.

789
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,400
[LAUGHTER]

790
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,480
This is awesome.

791
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,336
He goes, I can fix it and
you can breathe like that

792
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,080
for the rest of your life.

793
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,416
I was like, yes,
please, let's do that.

794
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,120
He goes, you've got
to make an appointment

795
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
and then you need three
weeks where you can't fly.

796
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,200
Well, I don't have three
weeks where I can't fly

797
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,880
so I haven't had it fixed yet.

798
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,640
But now I'm scared to
get it fixed in case

799
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,360
I end up looking like a pig.

800
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,920
And then all my Muslim friends
don't come and see me anymore,

801
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,120
because they're like,
he looks like a pig, we

802
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,360
cannot go see him any longer.

803
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,840
[LAUGHTER]

804
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,160
I do this out of
respect for my friends.

805
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,080
Let's get back to this propofol.

806
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,560
Sandeep, you got to
get this propofol.

807
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,600
You've just got to go back
and tell them, listen,

808
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,280
I think you need to
check again and give

809
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,640
me some goddamn propofol.

810
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,400
Because if they give
me the bullshit stuff

811
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,080
you wake up feeling
kind of groggy.

812
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,360
Propofol, not at all.

813
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,840
I literally woke up like
this, whew, let's do this.

814
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,960
She goes, we're done, sir.

815
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,120
I go, you're done?

816
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,600
[LAUGHTER]

817
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,880
How long was I out for?

818
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,120
Two or three hours?

819
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,760
She goes, 15 minutes, sir.

820
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,160
I said, in 15 minutes I could
have saved a bunch of money

821
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,400
by switching to Geico.

822
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,120
She said, you can
go get dressed.

823
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,080
So I go get dressed and
I come back in the room.

824
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,000
And she goes, all right, Mr.
Peters, we're all done here.

825
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,480
Just so you know,
in about an hour,

826
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,960
you're probably
going to notice you

827
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,640
have a bit of a sore throat.

828
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,120
I said, what the fuck
did you do to me?

829
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,760
She said, sir, it's the
most common side effect.

830
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,640
You know, we shoved a
tube down your throat

831
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,560
which may cause some
irritation or some swelling.

832
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,800
About 98% of the patients
will suffer from that.

833
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,600
So if and when that happens,
just take an ibuprofen

834
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
and you'll feel better.

835
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,120
I said, are you sure
that's all you did?

836
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,680
She said, I'm positive.

837
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,080
I said, you didn't touch
my asshole, did you?

838
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,160
She said, what?

839
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,040
I said, what?

840
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,120
And I walked out.

841
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,360
[LAUGHTER]

842
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,920
An hour goes by and
then two hours goes by

843
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,200
and I go into a panic because
I do not have a sore throat.

844
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,640
I'm like, oh my God, I've
got the throat of a gay man.

845
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,080
[LAUGHTER]

846
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,760
Somewhere out there
is a gay guy going,

847
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,520
oh my God, these dicks
are killing my throat.

848
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,960
And here I am with all
those wasted talent.

849
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,600
I could have been
guzzling dick all day.

850
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
[GIBBERISH]

851
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,560
I'm the envy of a community.

852
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,400
Is that your wife
with you, Sandeep?

853
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,640
AUDIENCE: Yes.
- Hi, wife.

854
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,760
How are you?

855
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,440
Do you guys have kids?

856
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,320
How many?
- Two.

857
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,160
RUSSELL PETERS: Two.

858
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,040
Boy, girl, boy, boy, girl, girl?
- Boy.

859
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,200
Boy and girl.
One of each.

860
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,800
Are you happy with that?

861
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,760
Absolutely.

862
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,640
[LAUGHTER]

863
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,960
Is that the reason you
went dry on the endoscopy?

864
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,480
Because she was
like, if I'm going

865
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,120
to squeeze children
out of here, you're

866
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,400
going to take a dry endoscopy.

867
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,640
[LAUGHTER]

868
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,920
My advice to anybody if
you're going to have kids,

869
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,720
have a daughter.

870
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Daughters are the best.

871
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,600
They just...

872
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,520
[APPLAUSE]

873
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,720
They really are.

874
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,600
I have my daughter
and I have a son.

875
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,280
He's a month and a half old.

876
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,040
He's brand new, so he's
not very smart yet.

877
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,920
But I don't think he's
going to get much smarter.

878
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,240
He's not... boy, he's dumb.

879
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,880
Boy, this kid's fucking dumb.

880
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,360
Like, you know when they're
that small, like, everything is

881
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,600
a tit that comes to his face.

882
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,160
You know... I go to
kiss him, he's like...

883
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,080
Hey, fuck off, that's my
nose, get out of here.

884
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,560
You ever get a nipple this big,
you need to check the check,

885
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,480
because that's something
weird going on there.

886
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,200
[LAUGHTER]

887
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,480
My girlfriend's Mexican.

888
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,840
And I didn't realize how
Mexican she was until she

889
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,600
went into labor and
they broke her water

890
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,680
and candy fell out of her.

891
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,120
Do you realize my son
is Mexican and Indian?

892
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,640
He's going to be able
to engineer the wall.

893
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,640
[LAUGHTER]

894
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,680
And hop it.

895
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,160
He's going to steal
your laptop and fix it.

896
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,880
It's going to be an
amazing thing to see.

897
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,720
How old are your kids?

898
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,560
22 and 19.

899
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,656
RUSSELL PETERS: 22 and 19.

900
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,560
Man, you did all
this shit young.

901
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,720
That's crazy.

902
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,440
I mean, that's great.

903
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,120
I did it way too late.

904
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,600
You think about it, I'm 49.

905
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,240
When my son starts
walking, we're going

906
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,720
to be walking the same way.

907
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,120
[LAUGHTER]

908
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,840
I waited too long.

909
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,600
Do you remember your
first pregnancy?

910
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,720
You remember it clearly?

911
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,720
Do you remember how
many months it took

912
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,200
you before you started to show?

913
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,240
Probably about
four to six, maybe?

914
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,800
Yeah, it's usually
about that, right?

915
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,000
Four to six months on your
first pregnancy, the woman

916
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,920
starts to show.

917
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,160
My girlfriend, she started
the show after one month.

918
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,120
It was like, [DOOM].

919
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,000
I'm like, what the
fuck is going on?

920
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,760
How many?
How many?

921
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,760
How many motherfuckers
are in there right now?

922
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,600
I took her straight
to the doctor.

923
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,496
I need to know many
heartbeats you hear, doctor.

924
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,736
How many heartbeats do you hear?

925
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,400
There was just one,
but I got so scared.

926
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,480
Because twins at
this age, fuck that.

927
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,160
Anybody here have
twins or is a twin?

928
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,840
You have them or you are?
AUDIENCE: Boys.

929
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,680
I have boys.

930
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,160
RUSSELL PETERS:
You have twin boys?

931
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,736
And apparent...
- But they are younger.

932
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,800
RUSSELL PETERS: I'm sorry?

933
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,440
And apparently your sunglasses
didn't come with instructions.

934
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,680
[LAUGHTER]

935
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,560
This side of my
head is very cool.

936
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,440
That's only because you pulled
your pag lower, that's all.

937
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,760
You have twin boys?
- Yes.

938
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,240
RUSSELL PETERS: Identical?
- Yes.

939
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,480
Oh, see, that's twins.

940
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,280
What did you name?

941
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,440
Did you give them fun names?

942
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,960
Gouldet and Harlet.

943
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,920
Gouldet and Harlet?

944
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,560
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

945
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,520
It sounds like you're stealing
something and putting it away.

946
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,800
Gouldet and Harlet, please.

947
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,200
[LAUGHTER]

948
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,800
Identical twins.

949
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,440
That's the only people that I
think should be called twins.

950
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,920
Can you tell them apart?

951
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,760
Yes.

952
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,320
RUSSELL PETERS: Do
they were pags too?

953
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,520
No.

954
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,800
One has dimples.

955
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
One has dimples?

956
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,800
And the other one has...

957
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,640
Doesn't have.

958
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,440
RUSSELL PETERS: Oh.

959
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,360
Yeah, I figured.

960
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,280
One has dimples, the
other one, doesn't have.

961
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,776
Identical twins,
those are the only...

962
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,600
I hate when people tell
me, yeah, I got twins.

963
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,280
What do you got?
I got a boy and a girl.

964
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,200
That's not fucking twins ever.

965
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,320
What you got are two kids
with the same birthday.

966
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,880
Women call their
breasts the twins.

967
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,960
Have you ever had a
woman go, so would

968
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,320
you like to see the twins?

969
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,120
If she opened her shirt and
an elbow on an ankle fell out,

970
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
you'd be like, uh...

971
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,640
[LAUGHTER]

972
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,200
There's something
wrong with your twins.

973
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,976
Identical twins are the only
people that should be twins.

974
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,480
And I started getting scared
when I thought my girlfriend

975
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,480
was going to have twins.

976
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,000
But I started
settling into the idea

977
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,360
because I started thinking
of names for identical twins.

978
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,840
I was like, if I
have twin girls...

979
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,760
Because you've got to
have fun with the names.

980
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,120
If I have twin girls, these
are going to be my daughters,

981
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,800
it's going to be
Kate and Duplicate.

982
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,520
These are my boys,
it's Pete and Repeat.

983
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,240
If I had twins
with a black girl,

984
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,400
this is Tyrone and Tyclone.

985
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,976
Identical twins, that's like
bragging rights for you,

986
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,880
you know I mean.
That's your way of going, look.

987
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,200
Look at how good my balls are.

988
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,400
Look, look.

989
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,440
Or because you're Punjabi, look
at how good my junk they are.

990
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,400
Looks at this.

991
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,920
[LAUGHTER]

992
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,320
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

993
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,680
[LAUGHTER]

994
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,560
Look at how good my balls are.

995
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,800
My balls are so strong,
they made one kid

996
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,400
and then it made the
exact same kid right away.

997
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,160
You lift up your balls,
sponsored by Xerox.

998
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,760
Sponsored by Xerox.

999
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,800
I call the left one copy
and the right one paste.

1000
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,920
For the people that are in
relationships and your girl

1001
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,080
wants kids and you don't
want kids, I got some...

1002
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,400
I got a really great
way out of this.

1003
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,880
Men, you need to learn
how to fake orgasms.

1004
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,720
Trust me.

1005
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,280
Sperm face, do you have...

1006
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,720
[LAUGHTER]

1007
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,080
I'll just call you Gisbonda.

1008
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,240
You have kids?
- Yes.

1009
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,600
RUSSELL PETERS: How many?
- Two.

1010
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,400
Two.

1011
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
And with that lady there?

1012
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,480
Yes.

1013
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,720
And how old are they?

1014
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,600
So my son is going to
be 7 and my daughter is 5.

1015
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,120
RUSSELL PETERS: 7 and 5, OK.

1016
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,080
And you like them?

1017
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,320
I love them.

1018
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,400
You like them so much
you dress up as them.

1019
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,600
[LAUGHTER]

1020
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,960
It would have been amazing if
she was dressed like an egg

1021
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
and you were like...

1022
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,960
[LAUGHTER]

1023
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,640
Men need to learn how
to fake orgasms, that's

1024
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,440
their way around having kids.

1025
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Let me explain to you.

1026
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,960
First of all, women don't need
to know how to fake orgasms

1027
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
because they do it all the time.

1028
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,440
And women don't fake orgasms
because they can't have them.

1029
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,360
Women fake orgasms because
men are fucking idiots.

1030
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,840
Because here's the
problem with men,

1031
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,120
we either don't pay enough
attention to a woman

1032
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,840
or we fixate on one spot.

1033
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,440
We're like, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1034
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:32,280
And she's like ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, OK, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1035
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,600
But we don't hear the ow part.

1036
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,640
All we see is...

1037
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,200
That must be the spot.

1038
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,720
Don't leave that spot.

1039
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,080
Er, er, er, ow,
ow, er, er, ow, ow,

1040
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,040
er, er, ow, ow, er, er, ow, ow.

1041
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,280
And the only way to get you
to stop if she goes, ah!

1042
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,040
And then you are going,
yeah, I did that.

1043
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,280
And she's like, no, you idiot.

1044
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,400
I was going numb.

1045
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,080
You need to learn how
to fake an orgasm.

1046
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,280
Preag, let me show you how.

1047
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,720
When it comes to faking
an orgasm with a woman,

1048
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,560
it's very technical.

1049
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,840
I have made up a
list of suggestions.

1050
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,280
I recommend if you're going to
fake an orgasm with a woman,

1051
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,200
you should be behind her...

1052
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,720
Having sex, not
just standing there.

1053
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
That'd fucking
weird if you just...

1054
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,200
Oh.

1055
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,080
[LAUGHTER]

1056
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,600
What the fuck was that?

1057
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,240
So you should be behind
her having sex with her...

1058
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,720
With her... at same time, yeah.

1059
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,200
I recommend you're
behind the woman,

1060
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,600
because when you're behind
a woman it's easier to fake.

1061
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,520
It's harder for them
to check your work.

1062
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,960
Because when you're
behind a woman,

1063
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,480
very rarely does a woman turn
around and go, was that good?

1064
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,640
Never.
Because you know why?

1065
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,880
It's not an attractive angle.

1066
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,320
Women don't want
to look like, what?

1067
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,360
So when you're behind it's
like a horse in a race.

1068
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,960
Just [TROTTING NOISES].

1069
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,920
You never see a horse
going [TROTTING NOISES]

1070
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,240
So you should be behind her.

1071
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,480
And let me ask you something.

1072
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:16,600
You guys are fucking obviously.

1073
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,560
What's your name?

1074
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,320
Sorry?
- Sohill.

1075
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,296
RUSSELL PETERS: Sohill.
And your name, sweetheart?

1076
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,640
Shabina.
RUSSELL PETERS: Kibera?

1077
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,800
What?
AUDIENCE: Shabina.

1078
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,096
RUSSELL PETERS: Sha... shamuch?

1079
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,840
Pisha?

1080
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,240
Shabina.

1081
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,360
Subpoena?

1082
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,120
Wait, like as in you've got
to go to court tomorrow?

1083
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,600
Shabina.
RUSSELL PETERS: Savita.

1084
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,360
Shabina.

1085
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,640
RUSSELL PETERS: Shabina.

1086
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,280
That was like 10
different versions

1087
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,840
of the same name I just heard.

1088
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,400
Shabina, OK.

1089
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,600
I'm going I'm going to
prove to every woman in here

1090
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,000
that all men, including
myself, every man in here

1091
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,680
has ADD, every single one of us.

1092
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,920
OK, Shabina, you ever doing it
with Sohill and he's behind you

1093
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,640
and you can feel him slow down
and then speed up and then

1094
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,920
slow down and speed up.

1095
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,600
And you're thinking, oh,
my little SoSo's got...

1096
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,400
[LAUGHTER]

1097
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,800
My little SoSo has moves.

1098
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,840
Let me tell you something,
that's not what it is.

1099
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:15,680
Let me tell you what happened.

1100
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,096
It's ADD, that's exactly
what the fuck happened.

1101
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,960
Here's what happens
ladies, we get behind you,

1102
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,520
we're good for the
first two strokes.

1103
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,480
And then after that, ADD.

1104
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,040
We're like this,
yeah, all right.

1105
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,560
[LAUGHTER]

1106
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,840
I got to change that
light bulb when I'm done.

1107
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,960
Oh shit, let me get back to it.

1108
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,400
That's what happens.

1109
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,880
OK, Preag, pay attention,
bastard, hello.

1110
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,600
[LAUGHTER]

1111
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,760
So when it comes to
faking the orgasm,

1112
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,760
you don't have to do
anything crazy, all right?

1113
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,280
You're just doing your
normal sex that you guys do.

1114
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,320
And don't act like you do
all kinds of fancy shit

1115
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,440
in the bedroom, OK people?

1116
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,680
We all know once you're in
a relationship for a while,

1117
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,320
there's the three
basic positions.

1118
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,920
There's the us,
the her, the you.

1119
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,400
That's all there is,
it's three moves.

1120
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,640
One to get it started,
this one's for us.

1121
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
OK, now it's your
turn sweetheart.

1122
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,280
And then my turn,
that's what happens.

1123
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,800
And here's some good reasons
as to why you should fake

1124
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,600
an orgasm, because
you're not ready to deal

1125
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,600
with a pregnant woman.

1126
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,080
It's a very different...

1127
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:33,960
Are you pregnant, sweetheart?

1128
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,696
I could tell, because
you've got a thin face

1129
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,120
and then you're
holding your stomach

1130
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,360
and fat people never do that.

1131
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,120
So when are you due?

1132
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:40,920
Four weeks.

1133
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,560
RUSSELL PETERS: In
four, oh wow, you're

1134
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,736
right... like, right there.

1135
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,280
And is this your first child?

1136
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,480
And is she extra
horny right now?

1137
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,160
It's true, it happens.

1138
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,000
[LAUGHTER]

1139
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,400
It's a fact.

1140
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,400
It's true, they get really
horny towards the end

1141
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,200
of the pregnancy.

1142
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,200
And it's very
uncomfortable for us.

1143
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,736
Because my girl when
she was pregnant,

1144
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,176
she was like, towards
the end, she was like,

1145
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,760
why don't you want
to have sex with me?

1146
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,840
And I go, it's...

1147
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,240
Oh my God, you think I'm fat.

1148
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,840
I go, I don't think you're
fat, I know you're pregnant.

1149
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,320
Then why would you
have sex with me?

1150
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,520
I'm like, I physically
don't have enough equipment

1151
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,000
anymore to get in there.

1152
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,840
Because she got real big
when she was pregnant.

1153
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,720
I was like, I can't.

1154
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,000
She was like, I'll get on top.

1155
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,680
And I go, no, because
she gets on top

1156
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,000
then her stomach
pushes me further away.

1157
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,280
And I'm like, huh, huh.

1158
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,240
And nothing because
I can't reach.

1159
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,960
It just my balls
hitting her in the back.

1160
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,160
[SMACKING SOUNDS]

1161
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Nothing happening.

1162
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:37,080
It's like that scene
in "Back to the Future"

1163
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,720
where Doc's trying
to connect the wire.

1164
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,840
Come on, Marty.

1165
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,280
[LAUGHTER]

1166
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,040
OK, so you're doing your
three positions, right?

1167
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,160
It's a regular
lovemaking day, you know.

1168
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,240
You do us, her, and
now it's on to you.

1169
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,576
So you're behind her,
doing your thing.

1170
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,080
You don't have to
do anything extra,

1171
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,240
you just do it like normal.

1172
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,760
You want to set off any alarms.

1173
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,640
And when it comes time
where you feel like now

1174
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,360
is when I want to
fake my orgasm,

1175
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,720
this is where the work comes in.

1176
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,640
You have to sell it.

1177
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,400
You have to make a really
believable noise, first of all.

1178
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,360
All right, and it has to
be a noise that you're

1179
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,760
not going to accidentally
do in the middle of the day,

1180
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,520
all right.

1181
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,920
And it's going to
be a big noise,

1182
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,200
you don't want to be like, oh.

1183
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,960
No, that's... That's
not it, all right.

1184
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,040
It's got to be big and...

1185
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,640
But like something... like what I
do is when it comes time for me

1186
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,240
to fake an orgasm, what I
do is I just grab her ass

1187
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,400
out of nowhere really hard.

1188
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:35,880
I go [SLAP SOUND],
and then I go, ah!

1189
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,160
Because I'm never going to
make that noise ever in my day.

1190
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,760
Not unless I'm
doing an impression

1191
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,480
of a reporter from the 1930s.

1192
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,640
Russell Peters, LA Times,
can I get a quote, ah!

1193
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,760
So you've got to go,
[SLAP SOUND], ah!

1194
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,040
And that's only the beginning.

1195
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,400
Now you have to sell the orgasm.

1196
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,720
That's where the work comes in.

1197
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,320
So it's [SLAP SOUND], ah!

1198
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,320
[BLUBBERING]

1199
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,240
[LAUGHTER]

1200
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,120
You literally have to
act when her vagina

1201
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,200
is electrocuting you.

1202
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,040
And then when you're
done, you just collapse.

1203
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,480
You die, you die, you fall over.

1204
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,200
And then she'll be like, wow,
that was a good one, huh?

1205
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,240
You're like, yeah, that
was a good one, yeah.

1206
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,960
Pay attention though,
a couple of seconds

1207
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:38,040
later, she's going to go, hey,
you're not leaking out of me.

1208
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:42,640
You go, no, no, that's because
I shot that one way up there.

1209
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:43,640
I launched that one.

1210
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,120
It's in there deep.

1211
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,600
Whatever you do, don't burp,
because it's going to come out.

1212
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,000
[LAUGHTER]

1213
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,600
You know, Indian parents,
like the NRI Indians,

1214
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,200
they're very different
than you guys.

1215
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,240
You may not believe me,
but you guys are far more

1216
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,000
forward thinking than they are.

1217
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,160
Here's the problem with the
Indians that left India,

1218
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,160
they left India in
whatever year they left,

1219
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,040
and that's what year
India is stuck in.

1220
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,280
[LAUGHTER]

1221
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:20,600
If they left in 1970...

1222
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:24,400
If they left in 1970, India
is still 1970 to them.

1223
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,280
They can't imagine all
this shit is happening.

1224
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,256
No, no, Russell, that would
never happen in India.

1225
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,480
Yeah, come.
Come, motherfucker.

1226
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,280
You should see.

1227
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,920
You're going to see.

1228
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,680
They do, they try.

1229
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,240
They hang on to
shit that doesn't

1230
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,960
even exist in India anymore.

1231
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,880
They try to be overly Indian.

1232
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,280
And their whole
reason for leaving

1233
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,120
was bullshit, because
they'll do this, no, I

1234
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,440
want to leave and give my
children a better life,

1235
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,640
give them opportunities, expose
them to different things,

1236
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,720
let them experience a new world.

1237
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,800
And then what do they do?

1238
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,680
They have the kids born
and raised in America,

1239
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,640
and then around 18, they go,
son, we know you're dating,

1240
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,800
but maybe you should
consider an Indian girl.

1241
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,720
And you're like, but
we're in America now.

1242
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,800
I know, but you should
think about an Indian girl.

1243
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,880
I go, no, I mean, you
know, If I meet one, yeah.

1244
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,240
But it's not going to be my
focus, because there's so

1245
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,760
many other women
around here, I might

1246
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:09,960
as well try something else.

1247
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,920
I mean, if I'm going to
get with an Indian girl,

1248
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,520
what was the fucking point of
leaving in the first place?

1249
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,880
At least over there we
got way more choice.

1250
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,240
But son... this is the
bullshit they pull on them...

1251
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,360
Son, what will
happen to our culture

1252
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,840
if we don't stay together?

1253
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,176
What will happen to our culture?

1254
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,120
Let me tell you what will
happen to our culture,

1255
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:29,960
fucking nothing.

1256
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,400
Fucking nothing.
You know why?

1257
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,600
Because there's 1.3 billion
motherfuckers right here.

1258
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,200
[LAUGHTER]

1259
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,480
If every Indian
outside of India never

1260
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,320
married another Indian
again, we would still

1261
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,200
have 1.3 billion right here.

1262
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,960
You don't need us helping you.

1263
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,480
Even you guys are
like, stop fucking,

1264
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,800
please, we don't need any more.

1265
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,000
Here's what Indian parents
need to understand,

1266
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,680
is that the Indians
and the Chinese

1267
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,120
will forever, always, 100% of
the time, be on this planet,

1268
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,880
no matter what.

1269
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,320
There's too many of
us to just go missing.

1270
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,416
If there was a
nuclear war tomorrow,

1271
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,560
you know what would be left?

1272
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,040
Rats, roaches,
Indians, and Chinese,

1273
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,720
that's all that would be left.

1274
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,120
[LAUGHTER]

1275
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,720
And since everything's
already made

1276
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,760
on this great continent of
Asia, we're going to be fine.

1277
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,680
Here's what Indian parents
need to understand,

1278
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,040
if an Indian guy has a
kid with a white girl,

1279
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:37,320
they have a beige baby,
that's a win for us.

1280
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,240
I have two kids with Latin
women, my kids are khaki.

1281
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,360
If an Indian guy has a
kid with a black woman,

1282
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,760
that's a brown baby with the
possibility of a larger penis.

1283
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,360
That's another
fucking win for us.

1284
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,760
[LAUGHTER]

1285
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,120
And if an Indian guy and a
Chinese girl have a baby,

1286
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,560
that's a super baby,
and that's a win-win,

1287
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,360
and you can name
the kid Win-Win.

1288
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,200
[LAUGHTER]

1289
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,960
You know who I feel
bad for in this world?

1290
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,000
I feel bad for white people.

1291
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,680
I do.
I feel bad for white people.

1292
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,720
I know there's some in
here, but I can't see you.

1293
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,040
You're back there, I see
you glowing in the dark.

1294
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,880
I do feel bad for white
people because you're

1295
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:28,840
dwindling at an alarming rate.

1296
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,760
Like, there's not...
You realize, like,

1297
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,520
in about 150 years
there's not going to be

1298
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,920
any more purebred white people.

1299
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,240
They've just been
infiltrated at all costs.

1300
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,696
That's why I feel like
I live in America,

1301
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,080
and in America you
see on the news,

1302
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,536
you see white people
have these rallies.

1303
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,880
And people get
really mad at them.

1304
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,360
And I kind of
sympathize with them.

1305
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,800
You see them on the news, like,
the white people need to be

1306
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,760
together with the white people.

1307
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,120
They always add an h in
front of it for some reason.

1308
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,880
The white people.

1309
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,840
And I'll tell you what.

1310
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,680
But they're like white
people need to be

1311
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,840
together with white people.

1312
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,440
And I'm like, yeah, they do.

1313
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,720
And they're like, what?

1314
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:02,840
I'm like, I'm with you.

1315
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,120
We don't want you with us.

1316
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:05,880
I know.

1317
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,040
I'm not with you, with you.

1318
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,280
But I feel your pain.

1319
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,600
What in the hell's
wrong with you, boy?

1320
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,360
I'm just saying, well,
there's a lot of us

1321
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:15,120
and there's very few of you.

1322
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,680
I just want to see the
white people get preserved.

1323
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
Because if white people
go missing, who the fuck

1324
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:21,920
are we going to blame?

1325
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,360
[LAUGHTER]

1326
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,200
I'm not ready for that
kind of accountability.

1327
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,600
Look at Scratch, his kids
are half Indian, yes.

1328
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,920
He likes the brown.

1329
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,200
And I don't mean...

1330
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,600
[LAUGHTER]

1331
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,816
But Indian parents, they're...

1332
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,720
I know there's a lot of
Indian parents here too,

1333
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,280
but you need to
know, Indian parents,

1334
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,920
that you're very good parents,
but you're also really shit

1335
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,880
parents at the exact same time.

1336
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:54,880
Here's why they're good.

1337
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,280
They're good because
they love you so much.

1338
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,960
They're shit because
they love you so much.

1339
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,920
Because here's the problem
with Indian parents,

1340
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,320
they love their
kids to the point

1341
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,200
where they don't let
their kids think at all.

1342
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,561
Like, they don't... We don't
want their brain to burn out,

1343
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,560
just let us do all
the thinking for you.

1344
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,960
We will make all the decisions.

1345
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,720
And it all stems
from... we all keep...

1346
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,720
We're missing a generation,
you realize that.

1347
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,800
There is a generation
missing from somewhere.

1348
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:19,200
Because our parents
lived for their parents,

1349
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,176
and our parents are trying
to make us live for them.

1350
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,560
And then I guess
we'll pass it down

1351
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,960
and make our kids live for us.

1352
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,480
And who the fuck is
living themselves anymore?

1353
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,480
But that's what they do.

1354
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,800
They overpower you with
the, you know, son, just

1355
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,200
do what I tell you to do, OK?

1356
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,640
Trust me on this.
Don't do that.

1357
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,000
Go here.
Don't go there.

1358
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:34,880
Talk to these people.

1359
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:36,160
Don't talk to those people.

1360
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,240
And then I'm not the kind
of guy that can ever just

1361
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,040
take information like that.

1362
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,320
I always question everything.

1363
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,800
So I'm like... if you want to
see an Indian parent fall apart,

1364
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,000
question them.

1365
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,280
Holy shit, they have
no clue what to do.

1366
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,880
My dad would be like,
son, I don't want

1367
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,200
you going to that club tonight.

1368
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,200
I go, why not?

1369
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,280
What do you mean why not?

1370
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:55,960
I mean, why not?

1371
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,240
I need to know why I
should not go to this club.

1372
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,720
Son, because it's a fact.

1373
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,400
What?

1374
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,320
What do you mean?

1375
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,400
What does that even mean?

1376
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,000
Son, it means it's a fact.

1377
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,920
You haven't given me one fact.

1378
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Son, it's a fact.

1379
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,560
When something is a
fact, it's a fact.

1380
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,560
You cannot change a fact
because a fact is a fact.

1381
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,760
I'm like, is that a fact?

1382
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,720
I love coming back to
India and I'll tell you why

1383
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,240
because I love
coming back to India.

1384
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,056
You know, what's funny is people
ask me all the time whenever

1385
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,640
I come to India, like, Russell,
why don't you like Bollywood?

1386
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,440
Why don't you like Bollywood?

1387
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,016
I'll be honest with
you, I'm going to tell

1388
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,960
you the truth right now.

1389
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,800
Here's the reason I...
Here's the real reason

1390
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,640
I don't enjoy Bollywood films,
because I love car chases.

1391
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,880
And you can never have a
fucking car chase in Mumbai.

1392
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,240
[LAUGHTER]

1393
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,520
It's not even a plausible idea.

00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,600
Quick, get him.

1401
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,920

00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,880
Here's the thing now and we live
in a really interesting time.

1404
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,680
Where Indians used
to just always leave

1405
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,560
India to go on
vacation, I'm finding

1406
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,480
more and more Indians are
celebrating their country more.

1407
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,480
They're going to
different places in India

1408
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,880
and having, like, these really
nice trips and vacations.

1409
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,360
And that, to me,
is very important.

1410
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,280
Because the Indians that
left, when we come here,

1411
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,600
we only go to where we're from.

1412
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,720
We don't see anything else ever.

1413
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,520
When I was a kid and
I would come to India,

1414
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,600
just Bombay, Calcutta.

1415
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,320
That's all I would see, Bombay,
Calcutta, Bombay, Calcutta.

1416
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,320
It got to the point
where I didn't

1417
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,376
know if there was any more
to India than just Bombay

1418
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,080
and Calcutta.

1419
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,080
And I remember being here in
Bombay, I was 9 years old.

1420
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,400
And I said to my dad, I go,
dad, is there any more to India

1421
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,880
than just Bombay and Calcutta?

1422
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,560
And my dad said, no.

1423
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,440
Are you sure?

1424
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,640
Positive.

1425
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,840
But there seems like there's
a whole bunch of country

1426
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,920
out there.

1427
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,120
I'm sure there's more people.

1428
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,120
There are more people and
they look just like you.

1429
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,320
What do you want to see?

1430
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,040
I was like, dad, can
I see the Taj Mahal?

1431
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:26,120
Not from here.

1432
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,920
Physically impossible.

1433
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,440
It's a different place.

1434
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,696
You know, it's one of those...

1435
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,880
It's a beautiful place, but
I always try and explain it

1436
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,600
to people in North America that
India is the kind of country

1437
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,720
where you could cut it in half
and have a north and the south

1438
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,400
and probably create
two countries...

1439
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,360
Not that I want you to.

1440
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,880
But I'm saying, because
they're two completely

1441
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,040
different fucking worlds.

1442
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,440
You take a guy from
the north of India

1443
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,840
and a guy from the south of
India and throw them in a room

1444
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,080
together, they have
nothing in common.

1445
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,560
They can't speak
the same language,

1446
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,840
they don't look the same,
they don't eat the same food.

1447
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,120
The only one common denominator
throughout all of India

1448
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,520
is this.

1449
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,856
That's the only one
thing we can agree on.

1450
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,536
You throw them in a
room, where are you from?

1451
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,200
I'm from India.
I'm from India, what part?

1452
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:11,280
No, not that part, no.

1453
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,240
Growing up I was ripped off
from the Indian culture,

1454
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,080
my parents didn't
exposed me to it.

1455
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,480
It was unfair.

1456
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,760
Because I hung around
black people my whole life.

1457
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,160
From the time I was about four
years old all I hung around

1458
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,400
was black dudes.

1459
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,600
And it wasn't until I was about
18 that I realized, holy shit,

1460
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,136
I don't know anything
about Indian people.

1461
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,480
Because my name's Russell, my
parents are Eric and Maureen,

1462
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,400
my brothers Clayton, my
grandparents are James,

1463
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:35,880
Christopher, Sheila, Eileen.

1464
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,960
It's not going to happen.

1465
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,880
It wasn't till I
was about 18 that I

1466
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,280
started to meet Indian people.

1467
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,080
And I was so excited
to meet Indian people,

1468
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,520
but I'd never
heard Indian names.

1469
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,560
I saw an Indian guy, and
I go, yo, are you Indian?

1470
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,640
He goes, yeah.
Me too.

1471
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:48,240
I go, I'm Russell.
He goes, I'm Pancag.

1472
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,760
I go, whoa, what
the fuck was that?

1473
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,656
I go, why do your
parents not like you?

1474
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,216
And then he's like... and this
is when I realized how much I

1475
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:56,960
didn't know about Indian
culture... he goes,

1476
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,400
hey, you know that
one Indian song?

1477
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,840
I go, no, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

1478
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,920
Because my dad was very
much against Indian music.

1479
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,440
He didn't like the Indian movies
or the Indian music at all.

1480
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,680
It was just his... he just
didn't like the sound of it.

1481
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,840
And I get it, you know.

1482
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,976
Like, my mom would sneak the
Indian channel on every now

1483
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,256
and then and there'd
be, like, an Indian song

1484
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,360
playing in the back ground.

1485
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,000
My dad would just
yell from the kitchen,

1486
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,360
Maureen, shut that shit off.

1487
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,760
Sounds like cats in heat.

1488
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,200
And then I remember hearing
Indian music for the first time

1489
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,440
and I go, holy fuck, it does
sound like cats in heat.

1490
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:30,200
[SCREECHING]

1491
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,680
And that's why
there's so many of us

1492
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,640
because we listen
to horny cat music.

1493
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,680
But when I say I
didn't know anything

1494
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,320
about the Indian
culture, I mean fucking

1495
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,760
basic things I was lacking.

1496
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,800
And I was so mad at my
parents for ripping me off

1497
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,480
from that part of
my culture that I

1498
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,360
went out of my way to
try and learn everything

1499
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,296
about Indian culture.
But there's too much to know.

1500
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,680
There's no way you can know
everything about Indian people.

1501
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,080
That's probably why we believe
in reincarnation so you can

1502
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,360
come back and finish the book.

1503
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:02,280
But basic things, like, basic,
basic things I didn't know.

1504
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:06,200
Like, we came to India about
12, 13 years ago for shows,

1505
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,480
here's how much I didn't know.

1506
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,720
We got off the plane and the
lady... all I can remember

1507
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,280
is my dad teaching me was,
son, always be respectful, OK?

1508
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,640
Always be respectful.

1509
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,040
I go, all right, be respectful.

1510
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,360
We got off the plane in Bombay.

1511
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,160
The lady greets us.

1512
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,040
She goes, namaste, sir.

1513
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,440
I go, thank you.

1514
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,120
My brother goes, what
the fuck was that?

1515
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,840
I go, I'm being respectful.

1516
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,400
He goes, no, you
fucking idiot, you're

1517
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,960
supposed to namaste with her.

1518
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,760
I go, I don't know
her like that.

1519
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,040
I can't just start namasting
bitches all over the place

1520
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:35,840
and catch a me too.

1521
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:38,240
I'm not playing this game.
He goes, no, you fucking idiot.

1522
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:39,520
You gotta bow and say namaste.

1523
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,600
I go, oh, right.

1524
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,320
Namaste, right.

1525
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
So then we get to the hotel
and the guy greets us.

1526
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,720
He goes, namaste, uncle.

1527
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,880
And I go, uncle, who
the fuck is this guy?

1528
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,360
We got cousins
working at the hotel?

1529
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,840
Let's get an upgrade.

1530
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,680
And then after a while,
I got the hang of it

1531
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,560
and I became, like,
the namaste king.

1532
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,000
You couldn't out
namaste me for nothing.

1533
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,816
I was like... I was namasting
the shit out of people.

1534
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:59,360
I was like, namaste,
namaste, namaste.

1535
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,600
I was turning spins on it.

1536
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,280
Namaste, motherfuckers.

1537
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,800
I was like a black girl at
church breaking it down.

1538
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,120
Na-mas-te.

1539
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,760
[LAUGHTER]

1540
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,240
There was a lady in my hotel
lobby, she was about to sneeze.

1541
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,560
She went... and I went namaste.

1542
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,400
She she went, you
fucked up my sneeze.

1543
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,680
But I was on fire with
my namastes everywhere.

1544
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,440
And we were on tour and then
my fake northern half of India

1545
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,800
is namaste, namaste,
namaste, namaste.

1546
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,400
And then we went
to Chennai Madras.

1547
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:29,320
And I'd never been
to the South before.

1548
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,120
And we get off the plane.

1549
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,576
And as we get off the plane, the
girl puts her hands together.

1550
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:33,960
And I cut her off
and I go namaste.

1551
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:35,240
And she goes, vanakkam.

1552
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:39,440
[LAUGHTER]

1553
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,360
What?

North, taller, lighter
skin, bigger features, more

1568
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,840
body hair, not that bright.

[LAUGHTER]

1570
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,120
It's a fact.

1571
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,160
You go to the south, shorter,
darker, smaller features,

1572
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,280
less body hair, much smarter.

1573
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:21,840
And if you don't believe me that
you're smarter in the South,

01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,440
I'll prove it to you.

1579
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,920
And I figured it out,
it's the languages.

1580
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,520
Because in the north
they speak slower.

Please, sir, everyone
just calls me Naga.

I said, oh, I gotta
be honest with you,

1603
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,600
I grew up with black
people and I'm a little

need to get something.

Can we stop in that

1616

He goes, no, no, sir.
We must continue to venue.

I was like, Naga, please.

off and he loses his shit.
