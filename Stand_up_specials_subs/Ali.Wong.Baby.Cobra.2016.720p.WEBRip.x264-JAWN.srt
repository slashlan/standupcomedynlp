[male announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong!</i>

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,095
[upbeat theme music]

3
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,723
[audience cheering and applauding]

4
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:31,615
- Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you!
- [crowd cheers]

5
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,535
Thank you for coming. Hello!

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,578
Hello.

7
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:40,791
We are gonna have to
get this shit over with,

8
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,169
'cause I have to pee in,
like, ten minutes.

9
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:45,671
[laughter]

10
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,674
But thank you, everybody,
so much for coming. Um...

11
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:53,095
It's a very exciting day for me.
It's been a very exciting year for me.

12
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,889
I turned 33 this year.

13
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:59,268
- [people whooping]
- Yes! Thank you, five people.

14
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,770
- I appreciate that.
- [laughter]

15
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,898
Uh, I can tell that I'm getting older,

16
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:10,195
because, now, when I see
an 18-year-old girl,

17
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,531
my automatic thought...

18
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,577
- is "Fuck you."
- [laughter]

19
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,165
"Fuck you.
I don't even know you, but fuck you!"

20
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,127
'Cause I'm straight up jealous.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,131
I'm jealous, first and foremost,
of their metabolism.

22
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:32,009
Because 18-year-old girls,
they could just eat like shit,

23
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,804
and then they take a shit
and have a six-pack, right?

24
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,141
They got that-that beautiful
inner thigh clearance

25
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:43,103
where they put their feet together
and there's that huge gap here

26
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:47,608
with the light of potential
just radiating through.

27
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,527
- [vocalizing]
- [laughter]

28
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,159
And then, when they go to sleep,
they just go to sleep.

29
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,828
Right? They don't have insomnia yet.

30
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:03,498
They don't know what it's like
to have to take a Ambien

31
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:08,086
or download a Meditation Oasis podcast

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:13,383
to calm the chatter of regret
and resentment towards your family

33
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,261
just cluttering your mind.

34
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,929
[laughter]

35
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,142
They have their whole lives
ahead of them.

36
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:24,019
They don't have HPV yet.

37
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:28,065
They just go to sleep in peace at night.

38
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,532
Everybody has HPV, OK?

39
00:02:37,616 --> 00:02:39,701
Everybody has it. It's OK.

40
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,162
Come out already. Everybody has it.

41
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,040
If you don't have it yet,
you go and get it.

42
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,668
- [laughter]
- You go and get it. It's coming.

43
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,422
You don't have HPV yet,
you're a fucking loser, all right?

44
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,132
That's what that says about you.

45
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,887
A lot of men don't know
that they have HPV,

46
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,015
because it's undetectable in men.

47
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,270
It's really fucked up. HPV is a ghost
that lives inside men's bodies

48
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,315
- and says, "Boo!" in women's bodies.
- [laughter]

49
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,243
My doctor told me that I have
one of two strains of HPV.

50
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,414
Either I have the kind
that's gonna turn into cervical cancer...

51
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,957
[gasps]

52
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,795
or I have the kind
where my body will heal itself.

53
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,631
[laughter]

54
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,510
Very helpful, this doctor, right?

55
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,556
So, basically, either I'm gonna die...

56
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:46,351
or you're in the presence
of Wolverine, bitches.

57
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,478
[laughter]

58
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,105
[chuckles] We'll find out.

59
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,569
Um, I can also tell
that I'm getting older,

60
00:03:55,652 --> 00:04:00,323
because my Kindle
is turning into a self-help library.

61
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:06,329
I'm not interested in books
like <i>Fifty Shades of Grey,</i> OK?

62
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:10,834
I'm interested in
<i>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up.</i>

63
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,002
[laughter]

64
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,298
Yes. Yes, that's right,
how to declutter my home

65
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,218
to achieve inner peace
and my optimum level of success.

66
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,428
[laughter]

67
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:25,015
That's what your 30s is all about.
How can I turn this shit around?

68
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,227
I'm a horrible person,
I'm not happy with where I am,

69
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,689
how can I turn this shit around?
Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!

70
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,525
I have a hoarding problem,

71
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,279
which I'm hoping is the center
of all of my other problems.

72
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:43,492
I'm hoping that if the hoarding
goes away, the HPV will also disappear.

73
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:44,785
[laughter]

74
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:51,208
I have a hoarding problem because my mom
is from a third world country

75
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,669
and she taught me that you can
never throw away anything,

76
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:59,299
because you never know when a dictator's
gonna overtake the country

77
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,926
and snatch all your wealth.

78
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,304
So, you better hold onto
that retainer from the third grade,

79
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,389
'cause it might come in handy as a shovel

80
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,975
when you're busy
stuffing gold up your butt

81
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:12,187
- and running away from the Communists.
- [laughter]

82
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,902
The last time I was at home
in San Francisco,

83
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,196
I was trying to help her get rid of shit.

84
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,826
Don't ever do that with your mom. It was
like the worst experience of my life.

85
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,494
It was so emotional.

86
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,915
We were screaming and fighting
and yelling and it all came to a climax

87
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,209
when she refused to let go

88
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,296
of a Texas Instruments TI-82...

89
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,422
manual.

90
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,132
[laughter]

91
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,931
The manual. She don't even know...

92
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,016
where the calculator is.

93
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,935
Those of you under 25

94
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,729
probably don't know
what that calculator is.

95
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,233
It was this calculator
that bamboozled my generation.

96
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:02,028
We were all required to buy it
when we were in eight grade.

97
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:05,532
- It cost like $200.
- [audience members cheering]

98
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:10,412
And everybody thought it was like
this Judy Jetson's laptop from the future.

99
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,038
All because what?

100
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,749
- It could graph.
- [laughter]

101
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,379
It was like the Tesla of my time.

102
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,094
And my mom got so emotional
about the manual

103
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:29,556
and she was like, "You never know
when you might need this."

104
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,934
And I was like, "But... I do know...

105
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,313
that I'm gonna have to
clean all this shit up when you die."

106
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,231
[laughter]

107
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:42,277
"And I'm not trying to be
a procrastinator anymore.

108
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,447
Because according to Deepak-Oprah,

109
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:50,327
that's not the way for me to achieve
my optimum level of success."

110
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,626
I grew up a lot this past year.

111
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,420
Uh, this past year I also got married.

112
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,672
- [audience cheering]
- Yeah.

113
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,763
- To a man who now has HPV.
- [laughter]

114
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,516
Very lucky guy.

115
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,769
He gave me something.

116
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,647
- I gave him something.
- [laughter]

117
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,733
That will also last forever.

118
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,819
No, really. I'm the lucky girl,

119
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,073
because before him,
I dated a lot of losers.

120
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,784
Lots of losers. A lot of skaters.

121
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,994
[laughter]

122
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,248
You wanna be a grown-ass woman,
stop dating skaters.

123
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,962
Stop dating skaters unless you
wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen.

124
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,797
[laughter]

125
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,844
They're sexy on the outside,
malt liquor on the inside.

126
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,137
Horrible.

127
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,766
But my husband, I first met him
at this wedding

128
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,477
and, uh, he's--
he's much better looking than me,

129
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,020
he's way out of my league,

130
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,983
and I saw him and I was like,
"Oh, my God, who is that?"

131
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:07,195
And the first thing I learned about him
was that, at the time,

132
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,740
he was attending Harvard Business School.

133
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:15,370
And I was like, "Oh, my God,
I'm gonna trap his ass."

134
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:22,919
"Going to trap his ass!"

135
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,089
And I trapped his ass initially

136
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,967
by not kissing him until the fifth date,

137
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,053
which is a very unusual move on my part.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,389
But I did it on purpose,

139
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,141
because I knew that he was a catch.

140
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,436
So I was like, "All right, Ali,
you gotta make this dude believe

141
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,938
that your body is a secret garden."

142
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,440
[laughter]

143
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,488
When, really, it's a public park...

144
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,407
[laughter]

145
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,499
that has hosted many reggae fests...

146
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,084
[laughter]

147
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,339
and has even accidentally let...

148
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,970
two homeless people inside.

149
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,223
- I thought they were hipsters, OK?
- [laughter]

150
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,811
That store Urban Outfitters
has made things very confusing...

151
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,938
for my generation.

152
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,940
You homeless or you a hipster?

153
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,069
Is that beard for fashion or for warmth?

154
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,533
It happened to...

155
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,328
It happened in San Francisco,
when I was living there,

156
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,413
and I saw this guy in broad daylight

157
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:43,541
and we had, like, we had...
We had so much chemistry.

158
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,627
He was like, "Hey, wassup?"

159
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,046
I was like, "Wassup?"

160
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,256
[chuckling] And we--
The next thing I knew,

161
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,926
we were getting busy
in the back of my Volvo.

162
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,971
And then after we were done,
he was like, "Hey, can you drop me off?"

163
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,016
I was like, "Where?"
He was like, "At the park."

164
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,228
And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park

165
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:06,523
and watched him run into the middle
with all his other homeless friends,

166
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:11,027
- and I was like, "Oh, no!"
- [laughter]

167
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,741
"I just fucked a homeless dude!

168
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,412
- Again!"
- [laughter]

169
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,587
My husband is Asian.

170
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,132
Which a lot of people are shocked by,

171
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,468
because, usually,
Asian-American women who, like,

172
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:38,513
you know, wear these kinda glasses
and have a lot of opinions,

173
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,014
they like to date white dudes.

174
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:44,978
You go to any hipster neighborhood
in a major city in America

175
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:47,814
and that shit
is turning into a Yoko Ono factory.

176
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,943
It's... too much. I don't know
what's wrong with these bitches.

177
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,029
I get it, you know,
because being with a white dude

178
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,197
you feel very...

179
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,325
You feel very picturesque
when you're with a white dude, you know.

180
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,120
You feel like you're
in a Wes Anderson movie or something.

181
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:07,292
And you know, white dudes, they
teach you about a lot of cool stuff

182
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,962
like voting and recycling,

183
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,840
and disturbing documentaries.

184
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,009
They introduce you
to cool stuff like that

185
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,221
and it's very, you know, it's hot
hookin' up with a white dude.

186
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,516
I mean, nothing makes me feel
more powerful

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,978
than when a white dude eats my pussy.
Oh, my God.

188
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,024
I just feel like I'm absorbing
all of that privilege

189
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,902
- and all of that entitlement...
- [laughter]

190
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,864
you know, just right there,
through the money hole and just...

191
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,783
And then also,
he's so vulnerable down there.

192
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,287
I'm, like, "I could just crush your head
at any moment, white man!

193
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,124
I could just kill you right now!
Crush those brains!

194
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,793
Colonize the colonizer!" You know?

195
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,890
But I think that for marriage,

196
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:08,019
it can be nice to be
with somebody of your own race.

197
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:11,648
The advantage is that
you get to go home...

198
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,943
- and be racist together.
- [laughter]

199
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,659
You get to say whatever you like!

200
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,994
You don't gotta explain shit.

201
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:29,499
My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese.

202
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,795
I'm half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese.

203
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:39,342
And we spend 100 percent of our time
shitting on Korean people.

204
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,886
- It's... amazing.
- [laughter]

205
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:47,475
It's what love is built on, you know?

206
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,817
My last boyfriend was Cuban

207
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:01,239
and his family would shit
on Mexican people all the time.

208
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,408
And I was like, "Hold it.

209
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,496
- You guys aren't Mexican?"
- [laughter]

210
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,754
Asian-American men are very underrated.

211
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:20,174
I don't know why people
don't go for them. They're the sexiest.

212
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,968
Asian men are the sexiest.

213
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:26,723
- They got no body hair from the neck down.
- [laughter]

214
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,187
It's like making love to a dolphin.

215
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,234
Oh, my God. It's so smooth,
just like a slip and slide.

216
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,989
Just black fish, Tilikum,
all up in my bed every night, you know?

217
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,742
Ooh-wee.

218
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:50,496
You mess with a Jewish dude
and your body is all fucked up afterwards.

219
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,082
It's all red and inflamed
and you're like,

220
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,045
- "I did not ask to be exfoliated today."
- [laughter]

221
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,841
"This is the last time I go on J-date,
more like loofah date.

222
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,887
Thanks for the rug burn, Avi."

223
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,764
[laughter]

224
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,312
And then Asian men, no body odor. None.

225
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,524
They just smell like responsibility.

226
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,026
[laughter]

227
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,947
That's where the umami flavor comes from.

228
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,958
I think my husband and I
have a huge unspoken understanding,

229
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,335
uh, between each other,

230
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,629
because he's half-Filipino
and half-Japanese

231
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,881
and I'm half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese.

232
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,218
So, we're both half-fancy Asian...

233
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,303
[laughter]

234
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,727
- and half-jungle Asian.
- [laughter]

235
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,020
Yeah!

236
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,647
You guys know the difference.

237
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,566
The fancy Asians are the Chinese,
the Japanese.

238
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,736
They get to do fancy things
like host Olympics.

239
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,489
Jungle Asians host diseases.

240
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,991
It's... It's different.

241
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,161
But he grew up on the East Coast,

242
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,873
going to private school,
playing lacrosse,

243
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,710
uh, you know, learning Latin
and playing chess and rugby.

244
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:23,381
- He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK?
- [laughter]

245
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,717
So, he didn't know anything
about Vietnamese people

246
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,761
until he met me.

247
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,596
And on one of our first dates,

248
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,559
he took me to this restaurant
on the west side of Los Angeles

249
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,103
called Pho Show.

250
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,729
[laughter]

251
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,196
He was like, "It's authentic Vietnamese.
I read about it on Yelp!"

252
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,907
I was like, "It's not authentic, OK?"

253
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:52,618
You can tell, first and foremost,
by the name,

254
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,871
'cause it don't got a number in it.

255
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,206
[laughter, cheering]

256
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,836
Second of all,
you can tell by the bathroom.

257
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,254
If it was legit,

258
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,007
the bathroom would double
as a supply closet.

259
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,925
[laughter]

260
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,555
When I pee, I need to see
ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine

261
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,558
and a grandma with glaucoma
napping in the corner.

262
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:16,976
[laughter]

263
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,813
And the wait staff here is too nice.

264
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,650
We need to leave this restaurant
deaf and emotionally abused.

265
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,616
I grew up going to private school, too.

266
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,744
Him and I are both total, like,
private school Asians.

267
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,996
We both are big hippies, too.

268
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,916
We like to backpack
through Southeast Asia.

269
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,001
We like to do yoga.

270
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,754
We do ayahuasca ceremonies.

271
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,589
We do silent meditation retreats.

272
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,343
That's right, we pay $800
to shut up for a weekend.

273
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,886
We do shit like that.

274
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,180
Uh, we eat gluten-free,

275
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:58,059
which means we eat all that bread
that tastes like free-range Chewbacca.

276
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,894
[laughter]

277
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:03,022
- We eat that lesbian bread that's like...
- [laughter]

278
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,108
a thousand percent
of your daily fiber...

279
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,237
and 20 percent spoken word poetry.

280
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,035
When you eat it, you queef
a shitty poem about...

281
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,037
[laughter]

282
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,748
supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever.

283
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,416
[crowd chuckling]

284
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,629
And so, it's funny, right,

285
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,423
because he's Asian, too.

286
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,760
But sometimes, all of this
hippy-dippy shit we do...

287
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,639
makes me feel like we are white people

288
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,183
doing an impression of Asian people.

289
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,434
[laughter]

290
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,897
Like, we have these Chinese scrolls
up on the wall...

291
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,734
and neither of us know
what the fuck they mean.

292
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,278
[laughter]

293
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,951
We're like, "Oh, that seems to go
very well with our Buddha piggy bank

294
00:17:57,034 --> 00:18:00,413
- from Pier 1 Imports.
- [laughter]

295
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,457
That seems to be providing
some good feng shui for the house.

296
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,126
[laughter]

297
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:12,091
Him and I had been dating for four years

298
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:17,263
and I-- I just had this sneaking suspicion

299
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,432
that he was gonna propose...

300
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,310
because...

301
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,980
I had been pressuring him to do it.

302
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,487
So, you know, I just had this
wacky women's intuition.

303
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,907
That's how proposals really work, OK?

304
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,244
A woman has to incept the idea
into the man's head.

305
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:43,122
First passively and then
if he doesn't get the message,

306
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,458
- extremely aggressively.
- [laughter]

307
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,003
You gotta threaten to leave
without ever actually leaving,

308
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,047
because you know that you're too old

309
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,467
and it's too late to go back out there
and find a new man

310
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,720
and start the whole manipulation cycle
all over again.

311
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,096
[laughter]

312
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,391
So, you're like, "I'm just gonna
stick with this dude,

313
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,602
focus on trapping this dude,

314
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:10,274
and just nag the shit outta him
until he becomes weak and caves in

315
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,402
and gets fed up and is like,
"Shut the fuck up!

316
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:15,946
Fine, will you marry me?"

317
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,406
[laughter]

318
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,909
And then afterwards,
the woman is always, like,

319
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,454
- "Oh, my God! He proposed!"
- [laughter]

320
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:28,292
"It came outta nowhere.

321
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:33,172
And look, he got me
the exact ring I wanted.

322
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,300
How did he know?

323
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,889
Maybe he saw it
on my Pinterest page or something...

324
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:47,019
that I sent to my best friend,
that I told her to send to him every day."

325
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:48,854
[laughter]

326
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:53,442
Let me tell you something.
If a man has a Pinterest page...

327
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:56,779
he's probably Pinterested in men.

328
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,656
[laughter]

329
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:06,038
We got engaged on a Saturday.

330
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,458
I bought my wedding dress
the following Tuesday...

331
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:14,338
- because I had tried it on in 2012.
- [laughter]

332
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,299
I was ready.

333
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,676
I was ripe.

334
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,553
I was rotten.

335
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,724
I need to be made into banana bread.
That's how rotten I was.

336
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,600
[laughter]

337
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:33,941
People are always very surprised
at how, off-stage, with my husband,

338
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,694
I'm a completely different person.

339
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,698
You-- Like, you would not recognize
my personality at all with him.

340
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,242
With him, I'm very soft,

341
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,495
and, like, very nurturing
and very domestic.

342
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,582
We've been together now for five years,

343
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:54,837
and for five years, I've packed his lunch
every single day.

344
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,715
- [crowd whoops, applauds]
- Yeah. Yes.

345
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,217
Yes. Yes.

346
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:04,096
I did that so that he'd become
dependent on me.

347
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,639
[laughter]

348
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,023
'Cause he graduated
from Harvard Business School,

349
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,776
and I don't wanna work anymore.

350
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,110
[laughter]

351
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,406
I don't. I straight up
don't wanna work anymore.

352
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:25,367
I don't feed him
out of the goodness of my heart.

353
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:29,079
I do it as an investment
in my financial future.

354
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,581
[laughter]

355
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,374
'Cause I don't wanna work anymore.

356
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,252
I've been reading that book
by Sheryl Sandberg,

357
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,797
she's the C.O.O. of Facebook,

358
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,842
and she wrote that book that got women
all riled up about our careers.

359
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:45,638
Talking about how we as women
should challenge ourselves

360
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,724
to sit at the table and rise to the top.

361
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,769
And her book is called <i>Lean In.</i>

362
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,900
Well, I don't wanna lean in, OK?

363
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:01,111
- I wanna lie down.
- [laughter]

364
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,868
I want to lie the fuck down.

365
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:13,499
I think feminism is the worst thing
that ever happened to women.

366
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,962
Our job used to be no job.

367
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,213
[laughter]

368
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,341
We had it so good.

369
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,511
We could have done the smart thing,

370
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:29,139
which would have been
to continue playing dumb

371
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:30,933
for the next century

372
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,851
and be like, "We're dumb women.

373
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,520
We don't know how to do anything.

374
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,523
So, I guess we better
just stay at home all day

375
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,316
and eat snacks and watch <i>Ellen."</i>

376
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,818
[laughter]

377
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,531
"'Cause we're too stupid
to have any real responsibility."

378
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,158
And then, all these women had to show off

379
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:51,453
and be like, "We could do it!
We could do anything."

380
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,872
- "Bitch, shut up!"
- [laughter]

381
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,127
"Don't tell them the secret."

382
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,132
They ruined it for us,

383
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,051
and now we're expected to work.

384
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,805
When I hear the phrase,
"Double-income household,"

385
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,307
I wanna throw up.

386
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,850
[laughter]

387
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:19,607
A lot of women get very upset with me
about those comments.

388
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:23,569
And they're like, "But, Ali,
we have so many more options now."

389
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,655
Oh, you don't think
we had a lot of options

390
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,158
when our day was free?

391
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,701
[laughter]

392
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,122
Unscheduled, unsupervised,

393
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,750
and most importantly, sponsored?

394
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,335
[laughter]

395
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,547
Do you know how much shittier food tastes

396
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,341
when you know you have to earn it?

397
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,684
A lot of my friends,
when we walk around together,

398
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,645
they'll get very judgmental

399
00:23:57,728 --> 00:24:00,731
about housewives
that we'll see on the street.

400
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,067
And they'll be like,
"Look at that fucking housewife.

401
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,276
Not doing anything.

402
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,737
Look at that housewife,
just walking around all day,

403
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,448
getting massages in her Lululemon pants."

404
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,828
- I'm like, "That bitch is a genius."
- [laughter]

405
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:18,791
"She's not a housewife, she's retired."

406
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:24,004
I do write for <i>Fresh Off the Boat</i>
on ABC.

407
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,882
- [crowd whoops, applauds]
- Yeah. Which is...

408
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:28,592
It's a great show.

409
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,761
I love it a lot. I love my co-workers.

410
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,305
It's a great writing staff
and in terms of day jobs,

411
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,183
it's probably one of the best
you could ask for,

412
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:40,854
but I still gotta work at a office
every day.

413
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:45,776
Which means I gotta shit in a office
every day.

414
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,571
Housewives, they don't gotta shit
in a office.

415
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,658
Housewives get to shit in their house.

416
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,576
Skin to seat.

417
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:58,330
They don't gotta use
that horrible toilet paper cover.

418
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,665
They don't gotta...

419
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,001
[laughter]

420
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,838
ten times a day, every day...

421
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:11,343
- like you're about to eat a sad-ass meal.
- [laughter]

422
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:12,636
They don't gotta do that.

423
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,973
They don't gotta use
that one-ply toilet paper,

424
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,558
that office toilet paper,

425
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,769
that they purposely
make difficult to pull out.

426
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:24,481
They try to ration me
with their communist toilet paper

427
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,816
that's not even effective.

428
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,777
It basically just dehydrates
your butt hole.

429
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,530
It's basically like wiping your butt
with the desert.

430
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,282
[laughter]

431
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,455
I literally spat on my toilet paper
two days ago,

432
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,791
to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe,
to moisten it,

433
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,420
and then it backfired
'cause my fingers broke through

434
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,590
and digitally stimulated
more doo doo to come out,

435
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:52,134
and then I had to start all over again.

436
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:02,060
And you can never finish wiping at work

437
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,062
because you always feel rushed

438
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,230
'cause you're paranoid

439
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:08,150
that your co-worker's gonna
recognize your shoes

440
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,526
underneath the stall.

441
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,154
And you're like, "Oh, no!
Courtney's listening.

442
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,531
She's waiting. She's timing me."

443
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,992
And then you hurry, hurry, hurry,

444
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,660
and then you never finish wiping

445
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,747
and then your butt hole
feels caked in doo doo all day long.

446
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,292
And then if you dare scratch yourself,
your underwear at the end of the day

447
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,920
looks like it's been run over
by the Goonies.

448
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,713
[laughter]

449
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:38,764
Housewives, they don't gotta
muffle their shit, too.

450
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:42,976
They don't gotta worry about the velocity
with which their doo doo comes out.

451
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,895
They don't gotta try to, you know,

452
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,939
squeeze the butt cheeks together

453
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:51,360
to make sure that the doo doo comes out
at a slow and steady pace,

454
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,614
so that no unpredictable noise
suddenly escapes

455
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:58,659
and brings you deep, deep shame.

456
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,788
Housewives are free to
just blow ass into the toilet

457
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,458
and let it echo and reverberate
to the ends of their hallways

458
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,295
while watching as much Netflix
on their iPad as they want.

459
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:15,259
They don't gotta take
these boring, repressed shits.

460
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,511
They can listen to podcasts.

461
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,225
Planet Money.
They can do whatever they want.

462
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,856
[laughter]

463
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,818
You know, it's--
it's very distracting for me

464
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,820
when I hear my co-workers

465
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,947
blow ass into the toilet.

466
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,825
I lose respect for them.

467
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,828
Nothing they say to me anymore

468
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,622
- holds any sort of credence.
- [laughter]

469
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:50,043
I heard one of my co-workers
blow ass into the toilet the other day.

470
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:52,713
This bitch had the nerve
to come up to me and say,

471
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,674
"You need to get to work on time."

472
00:27:57,593 --> 00:28:00,971
- I was like, "You need to eat bananas."
- [laughter]

473
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:06,101
"I saw those green ballet flats.
I know that shit was you.

474
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,186
Don't try to tell me
to get my shit together

475
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,772
when I heard you
not have your shit together."

476
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:17,446
My father-in-law had this huge sit-down

477
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,615
with me and my husband recently.

478
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,158
Um, and he was like, "Hey,

479
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:24,786
I wanna talk to you guys about money.

480
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,206
You guys need to make a lot more money

481
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,958
if you wanna provide your children

482
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:34,046
with the same kind of privileged
childhood that you guys had."

483
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,382
I was like,
"Why you telling me this shit?

484
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:40,260
I should not
be a part of this conversation.

485
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,762
You tell you son that.

486
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,263
Don't your understand

487
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,308
that I trapped your son
for his earning potential?

488
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,519
Why else would I choose
to fuck one person

489
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,146
for the rest of my life?

490
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:55,275
I chose to marry him
on the promise of early retirement,

491
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:56,902
and when I said, 'I do, '

492
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,570
what I really meant was,

493
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,197
'Oh, I'm done.'"

494
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,740
[laughter]

495
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,076
I'm done.

496
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,245
I don't wanna work anymore

497
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,080
and I'm not dieting anymore.

498
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,665
Since I got married last year,

499
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,709
I've been eating fried chicken skin
every day since.

500
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:16,046
That's right.
And just fulfilling my destiny.

501
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,675
Which is to turn into
a circle with eyelashes.

502
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,510
[laughter]

503
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,803
Like Mrs. Pacman, just...

504
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,930
[grunting]

505
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,181
Let's redecorate.

506
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,558
- [grunting]
- [laughter, applause]

507
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,650
I gave up a lot of myself
when I got married.

508
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,027
I'm a-- I'm a disgusting pervert.

509
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,029
I'm a pervert.

510
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:44,116
I'm a gross filthy animal.

511
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,367
And I think it's because

512
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,996
I started watching porn
at a very young age.

513
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,832
And what happens
when you start watching porn

514
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,500
at a young age is that...

515
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,795
y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker.

516
00:29:56,878 --> 00:30:00,966
The images you crave
get sicker, and sicker, and sicker,

517
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,050
but it's OK,

518
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,970
because the Internet
will always catch up to you.

519
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,644
I broke up with my last boyfriend

520
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:16,648
because he refused to put it in the back.

521
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,819
I was like, "Uh, you're a idiot, dude.

522
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:24,573
Do you realize
that if I went on Craigslist...

523
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:29,077
and posted
'Tiny Asian female seeking anal...'

524
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,457
- the Internet would crash."
- [laughter]

525
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,170
"And all the Jewish male heads
in the universe

526
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,048
- would simultaneously explode."
- [laughter]

527
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:43,050
[chuckling]
They would explode.

528
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,553
A lot of women get really, you know...

529
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,513
freaked out about anal.

530
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,932
And they're like,
"Oh, I don't wanna do that.

531
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,934
I'm scared of-- of the pain."

532
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,978
You ain't scared of the pain.

533
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:58,065
Women, they wax their eyebrows,
they do all sorts of crazy shit.

534
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,483
You're not scared of the pain.

535
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,819
What you're really scared of
is doo doo on the dick.

536
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:04,363
[laughter]

537
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,491
You're scared that he's gonna see that

538
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,451
and that's gonna be all of your shame,

539
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,621
your inner evil,
all your secrets and lies.

540
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,748
Sephora can't help you now.

541
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,458
[laughter]

542
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,711
But don't worry,

543
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:22,547
'cause when he puts it in the butt,
all he's thinking about is,

544
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,342
- "I just put it in her butt."
- [laughter]

545
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,763
"I gotta go call my mom, my dad,

546
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,391
Dave, my grandma."
[chuckles]

547
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,813
You're-- If you're married, you're gonna
have to do anal eventually, OK?

548
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,232
You have to,
because you gotta change it up.

549
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,235
You gotta change it up,
so that you don't cheat on each other.

550
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,611
You gotta keep it interesting.

551
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,072
If you put it in different holes,

552
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,742
maybe you'll feel like
you're fucking different people.

553
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,372
I was very sexually active in my 20s,

554
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,833
and as a result, I'm a little bit...

555
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,336
[laughter]

556
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,505
stretched out down there, OK?

557
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,590
So, when I finally did anal,

558
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:09,428
I just felt like
I got a second chance at life, you know?

559
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:14,099
I was, like, "Oh, my God!
It's like I'm going back in time!"

560
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:18,270
<i>- ♪ A whole new world ♪</i>
<i>- </i>[laughter]

561
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,857
[chuckles]
It was magical.

562
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,529
A big fantasy of mine
before I got married

563
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,699
was to help as many men as possible

564
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,243
discover their prostate.

565
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,287
Yeah, like a conqueror.

566
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,663
I just wanted to... [chuckling]

567
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,708
Now, if you haven't done it before,

568
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,960
ladies, go home and treat yourself.

569
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,295
Do it tonight.

570
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,047
You only live once.
YOLO. Just sneak your--

571
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,633
Just give your man a little--

572
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,052
a little push-push
in the tush-tush.

573
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,305
Just give him a little Atari, you know,

574
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:56,975
and you'll get a lot of resistance
from the man at first.

575
00:32:57,058 --> 00:33:00,020
You'll get a lot of "No! No! No!

576
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,689
No, please! No, really, I don't-- No!

577
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,609
I don't! I don't! No!"

578
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,238
They get all squirmy wormy because...

579
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:12,282
they're scared.

580
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,660
They're scared that
if you stick your thumb up there

581
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,955
and succeed, and they like it,

582
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,250
that then, it might mean
that they're gay.

583
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,127
[laughter]

584
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,218
- And I like that fear.
- [laughter]

585
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:35,847
That shit turns me on, you know?

586
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:40,560
Especially when that fear
metamorphosizes into pleasure.

587
00:33:40,644 --> 00:33:44,397
Oh, my God! And you just see
the look in the man's eye

588
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,441
like he's discovered nirvana.

589
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,862
[chuckling] And it's like
you're the first lady to show him

590
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,448
that he had a magical clit
in his butt hole.

591
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:57,035
And then, you as the woman,
in his eyes, just become

592
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,996
the Lord of the Rim, you know?

593
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,165
[laughter]

594
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:10,048
My husband is unfortunately
just not as freaky as me.

595
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,717
When-- When I've asked him to spank me,

596
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:13,802
this is what he does.

597
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,596
- [dull thudding]
- [laughter]

598
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,395
"Hey. Hey, are you OK?

599
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,856
Are you all right?
You know I respect you, right?"

600
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,110
I'm, like, "Yes, I know you respect me

601
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,989
and that's why you need to abuse me. OK?"

602
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,866
'Cause it's the most strong-headed,
loud-mouthed women

603
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,494
who like to be abused the most in bed.

604
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,706
Women who are C.E.O.s,
they just wanna be roughed around.

605
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,834
They just want their--
[high-pitched scream]

606
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,461
Glasses always means
the woman wants some--

607
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,714
- [high-pitched scream]
- [laughter]

608
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,966
[continues screaming]

609
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,469
- [gasping scream]
- [laughter]

610
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:06,146
It's because we're so in control
all the time,

611
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,440
that we just wanna experience

612
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,151
some risk and be out of control,
you know?

613
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,236
Like, "I don't wanna die!

614
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,281
Don't kill me! I don't wanna die!"

615
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,909
But I also don't want to be sure
that I'm gonna live.

616
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,620
[laughter]

617
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,040
You know? I just wanna be
out of control for once.

618
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,376
Just-- Just choke me enough
so that I can't talk.

619
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,962
'Cause if I can talk,

620
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,757
- I'm gonna tell you what to do.
- [laughter]

621
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,302
And I'm tired of being the boss.

622
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,554
I'm the boss all the time,
so, in the bedroom,

623
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,181
you be the boss.

624
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,059
Yes.

625
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,104
- Because I'm the real boss.
- [laughter]

626
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,982
And I told you so, motherfucker,
so do it.

627
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,275
[laughter]

628
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,033
Sheryl Sandberg,
that woman who wrote <i>Lean In</i>,

629
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:04,120
has had such a big impact
that now, because of her,

630
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:08,249
there is a ban on the word "bossy"
in elementary schools,

631
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:10,502
because according to her,

632
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,380
it's sexist to use the word "bossy,"

633
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,132
because boys are never called bossy.

634
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,011
So, now, instead of saying,
"You're bossy,"

635
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:23,932
you're supposed to say,
"You have executive leadership skills."

636
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,183
[crowd chuckles]

637
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,853
Which is a very roundabout way of saying:

638
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,772
"You're a little cunt."

639
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,774
[laughter]

640
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,030
I'm just waiting for the right moment

641
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,701
to, like, become a housewife,
financially, you know?

642
00:36:42,784 --> 00:36:46,996
I want my husband to get us
to, like, a certain point financially.

643
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:49,541
I wanna get to the point as a couple

644
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:53,837
where I can comfortably afford
sliced mango.

645
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,842
Know what I'm talking about?
I'm talking about that Whole Foods mango.

646
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,761
That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango

647
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,347
- that was sliced by white people.
- [laughter]

648
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:07,434
That's the kind of income bracket
I'm striving for.

649
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,853
That's when you know you've made it,

650
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,606
when you're eating mango that was sliced
by a dude named Noah.

651
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,942
- I want Noah mango...
- [laughter]

652
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,569
Rebecca kiwi,

653
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,279
Danielle pineapple.

654
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:21,781
You know what else I want?

655
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:27,203
I wanna be able to take a stroll
on a sidewalk,

656
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,538
see a quarter,

657
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,331
and just keep on walking.

658
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,000
[laughter]

659
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:34,711
Like a princess.

660
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,968
I have some useful advice for all my
Asian-American brothers and sisters.

661
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,013
- [man] Yeah!
- [whooping]

662
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,016
Never go paintballing
with a Vietnam veteran.

663
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,809
[laughter]

664
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,316
[clears throat]

665
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:59,027
So, I don't know if you guys can tell,

666
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,946
but I am seven and a half months
pregnant.

667
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,406
[cheering, applause]

668
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,783
Yeah.

669
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,621
It's very rare and unusual

670
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:13,166
to see a female comic perform pregnant,

671
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,502
because female comics...

672
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,796
don't get pregnant.

673
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:19,380
[laughter]

674
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,261
Just try to think of one. I dare you.
There's-- None of them.

675
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:28,765
Once they do get pregnant,
they generally disappear.

676
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,184
That's not the case with male comics.

677
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:32,644
Once they have a baby,

678
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,313
they'll get up on stage a week afterwards

679
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,691
and they'll be like,
"Guys, I just had this fucking baby.

680
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,612
That baby's a little piece of shit.
It's so annoying and boring."

681
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,281
And all these other shitty dads
in the audience are, like,

682
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:48,618
"That's hilarious. I identify."

683
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,662
And their fame just swells

684
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,582
because they become this relatable
family funny man all of a sudden.

685
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,085
Meanwhile, the mom is at home,

686
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,296
chapping her nipples,
feeding the fucking baby,

687
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,842
and wearing a frozen diaper
'cause her pussy needs to heal

688
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:05,969
from the baby's head shredding it up.

689
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:07,178
She's busy.

690
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,143
So, I don't know what's gonna
happen to me.

691
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:19,315
You know, a lot of
my female stand-up comic friends

692
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,486
who are a lot more successful
and famous than me

693
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,238
discouraged me from having a kid.

694
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,658
And they were like, "Ali, why are you
gonna have a kid?

695
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,952
You just gonna become--
You're gonna disappear,

696
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,080
and you're gonna become
some lame stay-at-home mom."

697
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,333
I was like, "Yeah, that's the dream."

698
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:38,751
[laughter]

699
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:42,589
That's the point.
This is the ultimate trap.

700
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,633
I won, you know?

701
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,013
Another thing a lot of my friends
said to me

702
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,390
when they were discouraging me
from having a kid,

703
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,642
they were like,
"Why are you gonna have a kid?

704
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,937
Why don't you just travel the world
with your husband

705
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,733
and just do whatever you want
for the rest of your lives

706
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,693
with no kid attached."

707
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,695
I was like, "Yeah, that's cool...

708
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,697
until my husband dies."

709
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:11,242
Which he's definitely gonna before me.

710
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:14,787
Because I'm a Asian woman,

711
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:18,333
and therefore, guaranteed to live
until I'm a billion.

712
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,126
[laughter]

713
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:25,757
I'm guaranteed,
like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK?

714
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:30,011
We all know the phrase
"black don't crack."

715
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,014
Well, Asian don't die.

716
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,807
[laughter]

717
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,687
We don't die. Especially the women,
we live forever.

718
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:41,981
And you know why we're such bad drivers?

719
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,069
Because we're trying to die.

720
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,946
[laughter]

721
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,284
We're like, "Yeah! Let me see
how invincible I really am!"

722
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:58,081
"Imma make this left hand turn signal
and ignore this red light completely."

723
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,085
"I'm gonna make a right turn--
I changed my mind, it's a U-turn!"

724
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,922
- "I changed my mind again. It's a O-turn!"
- [laughter]

725
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:15,848
Every time I get into a car accident...

726
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:17,725
[laughter]

727
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:24,732
I'm like, "Oh, my God, not again!"

728
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,986
I need to hide my face
so that everybody doesn't see

729
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,697
that it's what everybody thought
it was gonna be.

730
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,535
So embarrassing.

731
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,954
My Toyota Corolla is a mess.

732
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,959
There's this huge
bear claw scratch on the side

733
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,421
from this aggressive brick wall
that came out of nowhere.

734
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,425
And then, on the hood,
there's multiple hand prints

735
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,470
from pedestrians who have had to
alert me of their existence.

736
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:01,019
I don't know what's wrong with me,
but I'm still here, you know?

737
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:08,234
I need to have children
to keep me company when I get older.

738
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,861
It's lonely.

739
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,738
My mom is 80,

740
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,615
going through a full blown
mid-life crisis.

741
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:21,998
'Cause she knows that
she's got a century more to go.

742
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:23,875
And she is so lonely.

743
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,752
All of her white friends, dead.

744
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,337
Her Mexican friends, dead.

745
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,465
Black friends, dead.

746
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,892
I'm just kidding. She doesn't have
any black friends.

747
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,477
[laughter]

748
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,565
Life is not <i>Rush Hour</i>, the movie, OK?

749
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,780
I need children to be there for me

750
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,948
when I'm older, when I get as old as her.

751
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:59,035
And when I say be there for me,
I mean pay for me

752
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,288
when my husband isn't around
to support me anymore.

753
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,874
I'm not trying to be one of those
old Chinese ladies

754
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,878
who recycles for a living.
That's not my destiny, OK?

755
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,507
Old Chinese ladies,
they don't give a fuck. They got no shame.

756
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,717
They're like, "I'm just gonna recycle...

757
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,636
go bald...

758
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,013
go to the park, do this shit."

759
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,809
[laughter]

760
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,074
They do that
'cause it's a free activity.

761
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:43,371
For them. They do it in their--
their big-ass V. Stiviano visor,

762
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,165
their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider-
Boba Fett helmet.

763
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:51,003
They wear that to protect themselves
from their arch-nemesis, the sun.

764
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:53,881
Their in a contest to see
who's gonna burn out first.

765
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,469
Old Asian ladies and the sun are like
the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.

766
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:09,147
I also decided to have a kid because

767
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,399
uh, I'm only 33,

768
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,776
which, I know, is not
technically high-risk,

769
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,822
but my body was starting
to show signs of change.

770
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:22,451
And it-- And it scared me.
Like, I'm only 33 and...

771
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,790
[whispers] ...my pussy is not as wet
as it used to be.

772
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,587
It's very demoralizing, OK?

773
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,840
Do you remember
when you were 18 years old,

774
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:40,094
and your pussy was just
sopping wet all the time?

775
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,680
All the time,
you just took it for granted

776
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:46,601
that you could just reach your hand
down your pants at any given moment,

777
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,686
you throw up the peace sign afterwards,

778
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,814
and there would be that snail-trail
in between your fingers.

779
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,025
Oh, my God, it was so juicy.

780
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,694
You could just blow
a bubble wand with it, just...

781
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,196
[shouts cheerfully]

782
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:03,659
"I slime you, I slime you. <i>Ghostbusters!"</i>

783
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:11,167
I don't know
what kind of mother I'm gonna be.

784
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,877
[laughter]

785
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:18,799
[chuckles]

786
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:22,219
I'm-- I'm 33, and I did have to get

787
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:26,057
a little bit of science involved
when trying to get pregnant.

788
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,475
And a lot of that...

789
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,644
is most likely my fault.

790
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,979
Because, when I was in my 20s,

791
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:34,482
I ate Plan B like skittles.

792
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:40,029
So, my uterus probably looked
like a smoker's lung.

793
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,530
[laughter]

794
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,909
And I found out

795
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,955
that my progesterone levels
were alarmingly low.

796
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:52,625
So, then I had to take these
hormone pills that were suppositories,

797
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,920
and Push Pop them up myself
every single night.

798
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:58,839
And then, at my writing job,
at <i>Fresh Off The Boat,</i>

799
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,926
I would be storyboarding
in front of my co-workers,

800
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,513
and then, at some point,
the pill would inevitably dissolve

801
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,348
and melt into my underwear,

802
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,726
and I had to act like everything was OK,

803
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:13,562
when everything was clearly not OK.

804
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,816
And then, a side effect
of the progesterone

805
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,443
was that it made me extremely itchy.

806
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:22,989
So, then I had to find ways
to discretely scratch myself

807
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:26,659
underneath the conference table,
and then resist the urge

808
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,912
to immediately
smell my fingers afterwards.

809
00:46:29,996 --> 00:46:33,124
- [laughter]
- I want to be able to smell my fingers

810
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,960
when I wanna smell
my own goddamn fingers.

811
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:39,422
Housewives, they can just
scratch and sniff all day long.

812
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:42,675
They just vacuum, scratch, sniff.

813
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:46,178
They make a sandwich.
"Uh, mmm."

814
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:50,766
They watch <i>Property Brothers</i>,
scratch, "What's crackin'? Mmm."

815
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:52,351
[laughter]

816
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:56,772
Every time you scratch yourself,
all you can think about is,

817
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,859
"When can I smell my fingers?
When can I smell my fingers?

818
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,403
When can I discretely find a way to..."

819
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,405
[laughter]

820
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,408
"smell my fingers?"

821
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,536
Nature made you urgently curious

822
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,540
to protect you, 'cause you gotta check
that it's all good in the hood.

823
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,501
If it's too funky,
you need to see a doctor.

824
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:19,628
Your fingers are your first WebMD.

825
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:21,547
[laughter]

826
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,971
When my husband and I
were trying to have a kid,

827
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,766
a lot of people were like,
"Oh, my God, that's so hot.

828
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,726
You guys doin' a lot of fuckin'?"

829
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:38,522
No, dude. That's-- That's shit you do
in your 20s, OK?

830
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,232
When in-- When you're in your 30s,

831
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,819
and you've been trying to get pregnant
for a while, it gets very clinical.

832
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:48,199
You pee on these ovulation strips
that tell you when the eggs are droppin'.

833
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,117
It tells you when it's Easter time.

834
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,955
And I would only fuck him
when it was Easter time.

835
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,000
It was, like, only four days
out of the month, and outside of that,

836
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:02,088
I would be like, "We're not fuckin'.
I need you to save it.

837
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:05,216
I want your sperm to be as pent-up,

838
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:09,011
and as angry and rapey as possible.

839
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:13,849
So that, when they come out, it's like,
'Release the Kraken!'" [roaring]

840
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,977
And they just come out like
a bunch of angry refugees

841
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:19,772
escaping a dictatorship, you know?

842
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,607
[chuckles]

843
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,776
And, um...

844
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,655
yeah, and most of the time, like,
we wouldn't even have sex,

845
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,282
'cause I was so tired
when I would come home,

846
00:48:30,366 --> 00:48:33,160
and see the smiley face
on the ovulation strip,

847
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,037
and I'd be like, "OK, it's go time,"

848
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,998
and I would just give my husband
a hand job most of the time,

849
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,876
and he would
close his eyes immediately.

850
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,379
I know what that means, OK?

851
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,048
When somebody
closes their eyes during sex,

852
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:49,260
it's not because they're
in such ecstasy with you

853
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,388
that-- that they need to close their eyes.

854
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,473
When somebody
closes their eyes during sex,

855
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,517
it's because they're literally trying

856
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,728
to shut the image of your face
out of their head

857
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,690
and instead project two Latina lesbians

858
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,485
that they saw earlier that day on RedTube
onto the back of their eyelids.

859
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,155
Which is fine by me, because then

860
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,116
he doesn't have to see
the expression on my face that says,

861
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,743
"Please, hurry the fuck up."

862
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,036
[laughter]

863
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,498
And then, when he was about to finish,
I could always tell because

864
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:23,836
the indication is very universal
when a man is about to finish.

865
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,629
It's when they get that...

866
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,508
- that stupid-ass look on their face...
- [laughter]

867
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:34,972
where they look like they just got bit
by a zombie, just... [straining]

868
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,393
[laughter]

869
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,441
And then, because we're hippies,
I'd be like, "Hey, hey!

870
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:49,778
Please look me in the eye and remember
to come with intention, OK?"

871
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,823
And then, I would jump on him,
and hold onto his neck,

872
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:56,368
and I would just twerk, twerk,
twerk the shit out of him...

873
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,915
and do some of this shit that I learned
in Atlanta. [grunting]

874
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:04,710
And then I would turn upside down
immediately afterwards...

875
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:09,590
to make sure all of that Harvard nectar
would just drain inside of me.

876
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:13,969
That's right. 'Cause I don't wanna
work anymore.

877
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,721
[laughter]

878
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,651
I'm very grateful to be pregnant
and to be...

879
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,695
this far along, to be
seven and a half months pregnant,

880
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,074
because, last year,
I had a miscarriage,

881
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:38,035
which is very common. And a lot of women
who are in their 20s

882
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,746
flip out when they hear that.
They're like, "Oh, my God.

883
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,582
That's so dark and terrible.
I can't believe that."

884
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,168
I'm 33. Girl, when you're 33,

885
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:49,922
you'll know plenty of women
who have had a miscarriage.

886
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:53,509
It's super common, and I wish
more women would talk about it

887
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,679
so they wouldn't feel so bad
when they go through it.

888
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,473
When I told my mom--
She's from a third world country,

889
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,892
and when I told her I had one,
she was like,

890
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,729
"Uh, yeah. Where I'm from,
that's like losing a pair of shoes.

891
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:10,985
It's whatevs, OK?"
And everything happens for a reason.

892
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:15,197
I found out at my six-week sonogram,
which is very early.

893
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:16,532
And the doctor says to me,

894
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:21,537
"Oh, my God, I see two sacks,
which means you're having twins."

895
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:26,375
And I was like, "No!"

896
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:31,213
And then she said, "But what I don't see
is a heartbeat."

897
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:35,384
- And I was like, "Yes!"
- [laughter]

898
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,555
"The Lord is mysterious!"

899
00:51:41,265 --> 00:51:44,935
Don't feel bad, OK?
They were the size of poppy seeds.

900
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,605
I've picked boogers larger than
the twins that I lost.

901
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,235
And most women won't let
their husbands watch

902
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,446
when they're going through a miscarriage.

903
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,489
I sat my husband down in front of me

904
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,367
while I sat on the toilet,
and I was like, "You look."

905
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,952
[laughter]

906
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,163
"You watch the whole thing."

907
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:06,206
And he felt so bad for me.

908
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,000
And I used it as leverage

909
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,919
and held that shit
over his head for a month

910
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:15,466
and got him to do whatever the fuck
I wanted him to do for 30 days.

911
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,260
- He took me to see Beyoncé.
- [laughter]

912
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,596
He bought me a bike off of Craigslist.

913
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,474
That's my miscarriage bike,
and I love it very much.

914
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:29,313
For 30 days, I finally had
the marriage I always wanted.

915
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,943
I'm scared about
giving childbirth, though.

916
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,613
I'm-- I'm very, very scared of childbirth.

917
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,282
That's why I'm going to hire a doula.

918
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:43,410
You know what that is?
You know what a doula is?

919
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,412
That's a white hippie witch...

920
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,164
[laughter]

921
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,001
that blows quinoa into your pussy

922
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,463
to Keyser Söze all the pain away.

923
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,967
A lot of women tried to freak me out.

924
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,553
They tried to freak me out
about childbirth by saying,

925
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:05,891
"Ali, did you know that
you're gonna poop on the table?"

926
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,396
I was like, "Yeah, I look forward to it."

927
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:11,772
[laughter]

928
00:53:13,107 --> 00:53:15,901
I'm all backed up from
holding in my shit at work.

929
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,445
I can't wait to cleanse.

930
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,741
It makes sense, like, that you--
that that happens because

931
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,494
when you're in labor,
you push, you push, you push,

932
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:28,664
and your husband will be asked
to assist in the labor

933
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,791
by lifting up your leg,

934
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:34,294
which subsequently turns into
a soft serve lever.

935
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:39,216
You just shit on the floor
in front of the love of your life.

936
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,386
And just when you think that's enough
to make him finally leave you,

937
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,764
boom, a baby comes out,
and he gotta stay.

938
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,685
That's the real
miracle of life, right there.

939
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:58,694
I can already see how a child
can really take its toll on a marriage,

940
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,696
because the baby
hasn't even come out yet

941
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:05,159
and I am already so resentful
towards my husband.

942
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:09,246
So much resentment, especially when
he asks me to do shit around the house.

943
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,916
[imitates male voice] "Hey, can you
wash the dishes?" [normal voice] "No!"

944
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,545
"Can you water the plants?"
"I am not doing jack shit anymore.

945
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,090
I'm busy makin' a eyeball, OK?

946
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:24,553
Are you makin' a foot? I didn't think so.
You change the channel."

947
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,096
[laughter]

948
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:32,895
I can already see how there's, like,
this crazy double standard in our society

949
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:38,525
of how it takes so little
to be considered a great dad.

950
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:43,280
And it also takes so little
to be considered a shitty mom.

951
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,741
People praise my husband

952
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:48,327
for coming to
all of my doctor's appointments with me.

953
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:52,456
"Oh, my God. I can't believe he comes
to all your doctor's appointments.

954
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,875
He is so supportive."

955
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,003
Guess who else has to go
to those doctor appointments.

956
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,631
Me! I'm the star of the show.

957
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:04,718
There's nothing for the camera
to see if I'm not there.

958
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:09,723
But he's the hero for playing
<i>Candy Crush </i>while I get my blood drawn.

959
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:14,895
Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms
seven months pregnant, I'm a bad mommy.

960
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,147
[laughter]

961
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,152
You know, I-- I-- I, like,

962
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:25,781
I berate my husband on,
like, a daily basis.

963
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,076
Partially because I really am mad at him.

964
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,871
But mostly out of survival,
because if he leaves me, I'm fucked.

965
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:38,669
So, I have to chip away
at his self-esteem on a daily basis...

966
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:42,422
to keep him down
so that he doesn't believe

967
00:55:42,506 --> 00:55:45,842
that he's worthy of
another woman's affection and leaves me.

968
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,596
I gotta keep him around
by keeping him down.

969
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,056
[laughter]

970
00:55:52,516 --> 00:55:55,852
People don't tell you about all this shit
that goes down with your body

971
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:57,354
when you get pregnant, you know?

972
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:00,274
Your nipples get huge and dark.

973
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,067
I didn't know that.

974
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,154
I didn't know that they get dark so that
the baby can see, like, a bullseye.

975
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,825
So that the baby can find it easier.

976
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:13,161
And then, you know, they get big--
they get big, like fingers.

977
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:17,457
Like, "You, you. You owe me money, you."

978
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:22,004
My nipples look like Whoppers now,
and naked, I look like a Minion.

979
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,338
[laughter]

980
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:27,217
But I'm not gonna be one of those
crazy pregnant ladies

981
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:31,471
who tries to get all back in shape
right after they get pregnant. No.

982
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:34,057
Hopefully, if you see me in a year,

983
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:39,271
I will have the kind of body where,
if I do a nude scene on television,

984
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,649
people will commend me
for being courageous.

985
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,737
For doing it.

986
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:51,867
Now that I'm seven and a half months
pregnant, my pussy's all wet again.

987
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:55,537
But it's different. It's not like when
I was 18 years old,

988
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,539
when it was like, really hot, you know?

989
00:56:57,623 --> 00:57:00,334
And I was like, "Why is it different?"
And I looked it up,

990
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:04,504
and my pussy's all wet again because
my-- my body's secreting mucus

991
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,633
to protect the baby
from bacteria attacking it.

992
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,638
- That's not the same.
- [laughter]

993
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:17,142
When it's straight up soldier glue,
when it's Neosporin.

994
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,810
[laughter]

995
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:24,524
So, you know, I-- I, in--

996
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:28,654
previously, before I met my husband,
I had dated a bunch of losers.

997
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,031
And then, I meet this dream guy,
who's, like,

998
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,200
way more handsome than me,
out of my league,

999
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,035
graduated from Harvard Business School.

1000
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:37,329
Worked hard to trap his ass.

1001
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:41,875
Got him to propose to me.
Oh, my God, then we got married,

1002
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,295
all my dreams coming true,
and then we got pregnant,

1003
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:48,882
and recently
we bought our first home together.

1004
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:52,886
And, uh, two weeks
into the escrow process,

1005
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:57,849
I discovered that my beautiful,
Harvard-educated husband

1006
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,311
was $70,000 in debt.

1007
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:03,188
[low murmurs]

1008
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,898
[laughter]

1009
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:12,114
And me, with my hard-earned TV money,
paid it all off.

1010
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:15,242
[cheering, applause]

1011
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:23,834
So, as it turns out,
he's the one who trapped me.

1012
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,168
[laughter]

1013
00:58:26,086 --> 00:58:28,046
[cheering, applause]

1014
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:31,049
How did he do it?

1015
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,260
How did he bamboozle me?

1016
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:38,724
Oh! Maybe because he went
to Harvard Business School,

1017
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:43,061
the epicenter of white-collar crime.
He Enron'd my ass.

1018
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,898
- [laughter]
- And now, if I don't work, we die.

1019
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,108
[laughter]

1020
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,029
Why else do you think I'm performing
seven and a half months pregnant?

1021
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:55,198
All right, I've been Ali Wong.
Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

1022
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:58,618
- [cheering, applause]
- [upbeat theme music plays]
