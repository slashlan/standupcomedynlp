1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,757
Miranda!

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,134
Miranda!

3
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,177
Miranda!

4
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:12,846
Miranda!

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,431
Miranda!

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,640
Miranda!

7
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:17,392
Miranda!

8
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,769
Please welcome to the stage

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,815
Miranda Sings!

10
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,356
Miranda, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be on stage!

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,626
I can't go on stage right now. I'm busy!

12
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,422
Busy doing what?

13
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,675
Hello. I'm waiting for this
scab to form so I can pick it.

14
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,890
Uh, change of plans.

15
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:03,146
Please welcome to the stage
Colleen Ballinger!

16
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,154
Oh, my God!

17
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,740
Hello, everybody!

18
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,159
This is crazy!

19
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:21,831
We're doing a Netflix special
at the Kennedy Centre. What?

20
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,293
This is nuts!

21
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,587
Oh, my gosh.

22
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:31,883
And you guys are never gonna
believe me when I tell you this, but...

23
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,468
I'm pregnant.

24
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,726
There's a tiny little
penis in there.

25
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,897
Is that weird?
Are there kids here?

26
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:51,444
You know, pregnancy
is the most beautiful,

27
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,156
magical, wonderful thing
in the whole world...

28
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,909
for everyone who isn't pregnant.

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,870
I am so miserable.

30
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,288
This is awful.

31
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,874
No one tells you how
much this is gonna suck.

32
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,334
I am so grumpy.

33
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,211
I am in so much pain.

34
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,171
I am constipated.

35
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,841
And I've been to the doctor,
I've seen the baby.

36
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,300
He's down here.

37
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,594
So then, what's all this?

38
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:19,516
People come up to me
and they want to rub my tummy,

39
00:02:19,577 --> 00:02:21,495
and they're like,
'Oh, how sweet. A baby,'

40
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:24,851
and I'm like, 'That's not a baby.
I haven't pooped in two weeks.'

41
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,982
'But keep rubbing.
Maybe it will help.'

42
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,695
I'm very excited to have this little guy.
I can't wait to be a mom.

43
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,738
But I'm gonna admit something
to you guys tonight.

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,740
I am so nervous.

45
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,325
I'm so nervous to have him.

46
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,703
But I'm not nervous for the
reasons you might think.

47
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,248
I'm not nervous 'cause I have
to push a baby out of my parts

48
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,542
and they're all going to rip into pieces.

49
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:48,984
I'm not nervous
because I'm going to be

50
00:02:49,045 --> 00:02:51,270
responsible for
another human being.

51
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,632
I'm nervous because this kid
is going to have my genes,

52
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,575
and I looked like this
when I was a baby!

53
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,558
That's not photo shopped.
That's my actual face.

54
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,019
And I know what you're thinking.

55
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,855
You're thinking, 'Oh, that was
probably just an awkward phase.'

56
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,316
You know, all babies look
weird in pictures sometimes.'

57
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:15,153
Oh, no. I was a very ugly
baby, and I have proof.

58
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,655
This is also me as a baby.

59
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,909
And this is me as a baby.

60
00:03:21,246 --> 00:03:25,417
And my personal favourite...
This is me as a baby.

61
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,131
And to any of you
out there who think,

62
00:03:32,192 --> 00:03:33,963
'Oh, you know what?
It'll get better.

63
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,506
You know, you'll grow out of that,'

64
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,801
you must be forgetting that
this is what I do for a living.

65
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,887
So no, it doesn't get better.

66
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:43,953
And if this kid looks anything
like me when he comes out,

67
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,600
I'm gonna be like, 'Put him back!'

68
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,146
Just kidding.
I'll love him no matter how ugly he is.

69
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,815
I'll just love him less.

70
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,738
Oh, how am I going to
explain that to my child?

71
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,449
He's gonna be so confused.

72
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,036
He's gonna think he lives in a
house with a mommy and a daddy,

73
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,288
and sometimes mommy disappears

74
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,666
and a crazy girl with lipstick
and a camel toe

75
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,876
chases him around the
house with a camera.

76
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,331
Like, what's he gonna
tell his friends

77
00:04:15,392 --> 00:04:16,714
that his mom does for a living?

78
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,800
What's he gonna do?
Show them this picture?

79
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,844
His friends are gonna be like,
'My mom's a doctor.'

80
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,471
'Well, my mom's a teacher.'

81
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,890
And he's gonna be like,
'My mom does this.'

82
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,559
Oh, God. Why did I give him that voice?

83
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:31,813
Just assuming he's doomed.

84
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,577
Oh, God.

85
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:35,209
We can get rid of that.

86
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,954
You know, uh, I've
been doing that...

87
00:04:38,297 --> 00:04:40,863
for ten years now.
I've been doing Miranda.

88
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,741
Whoo!

89
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,705
So long of doing a character
that everybody hates.

90
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,539
Everyone hates me. It's true.

91
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,919
I have made a career off of
people hating my character.

92
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,963
Are there any parents
in the audience tonight?

93
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,425
Hey! Thanks for coming.

94
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,893
You guys hate me the most.

95
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,181
No, don't worry, though.

96
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,559
If you're a parent and you
feel like you were just dragged

97
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,853
to some dumb YouTuber's
show tonight,

98
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,370
you were. Gotcha.

99
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:14,441
But also,

100
00:05:14,904 --> 00:05:18,145
I try really hard to make my
show enjoyable for everybody.

101
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:20,903
So yes, there are some
jokes for the kids tonight.

102
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,365
But there's also a lot of
mature, inappropriate jokes

103
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,409
that will go over
the kids' heads.

104
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,329
No offence to you kids,
but you guys are... dumb,

105
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,009
so they'll go over your heads...

106
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,447
and then the parents will have
something to laugh at, don't worry.

107
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,962
Uh, but it is true.
I get a lot of hate from the mothers.

108
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,872
Hi. Uh...

109
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:44,719
You all say the same thing to me
when you meet me, too, the moms.

110
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:45,905
And I think

111
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:48,264
you think this is a compliment,

112
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,682
but you always say...

113
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,935
'I don't know why
my kid likes you.'

114
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:56,177
Fighting back tears.

115
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,568
I remember this one time I met a girl
at a mall, and she was so sweet.

116
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,070
I was so excited to meet her.

117
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,197
She watched my videos.
She was a big fan.

118
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:08,701
But her mom was standing, like,
two feet from us and she looked pissed.

119
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,371
So I went up to her
to introduce myself,

120
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,498
and she goes,
'Oh, I know who you are.'

121
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:19,212
'If I have to hear your voice in my house
one more time, I swear to God...'

122
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,213
And I was like...

123
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,714
'Thank you.'

124
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:26,530
I did an interview with this guy once,

125
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,137
and he was so rude.

126
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,431
He did not want to be
talking to me at all.

127
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,133
And at the end of the
interview, he goes,

128
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,019
'All right. I have
one final question.'

129
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,105
I interview a lot of comedians.

130
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:40,191
'Is there a reason why
they're funny and you're not?'

131
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,177
True story. He said that.

132
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,795
And in my head, I was like,

133
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,822
'Well, is there a reason
why you're a dick?'

134
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,573
But I didn't say that

135
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,117
because there are kids here.

136
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,954
I said something better.

137
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,957
He said, 'Is there a reason why
comedians are funny and you're not?'

138
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
And I said...

139
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,418
'Thank you.'

140
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:02,296
So I'm very uncomfortable when it
comes to confrontation and hate,

141
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,174
but I'm a little bit better at it
when I can hide behind my camera

142
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,217
like a coward.

143
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,761
So I write songs about
the hate that I get,

144
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,099
and I would love to sing one
for you guys tonight if that's cool?

145
00:07:12,325 --> 00:07:14,581
Yes! Awesome.

146
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,229
I've got my ukulele.

147
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,524
So...

148
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,444
I have to warn you,

149
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:30,265
all of the lyrics to this song are
hate comments that I have received.

150
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,870
So there's a lot of bad words,

151
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,913
and there is some crude
language in this song.

152
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,542
So to all of the mothers that
I'm about to offend, um...

153
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,042
thank you.

154
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:44,306
'Why are you a YouTuber?

155
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,858
I'm not a hater. I just hate your vids.
And your voice.'

156
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,845
'You look uglier than my ass.
No ofoinse.'

157
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,415
'Does she have cancer?

158
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:55,123
Because I don't want to
make fun of her if she does.

161
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,212
Your cloths look like pyjamas.

'You don't know
what you're wearing.

163

You look good to you.
You look bad to me.'

00:09:56,599 --> 00:10:00,311

212
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,851
There you go!

213
00:10:08,376 --> 00:10:09,376
There you go.

214
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,069
You know,

215
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:14,655
I get a lot of hate, as you can see.

216
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,521
Uh, but you know what?

217
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:17,307
The hate doesn't really
bother me that much.

218
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:20,496
I'm usually able to let the hate
just roll off my shoulders.

219
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,108
But every once in a while,

220
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,126
there's just one
comment that gets to me.

221
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:26,529
This has happened
more frequently recently

222
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,405
because I'm pregnant
and I'm very emotional.

223
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,051
I cry at everything now.

224
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,850
Um, so recently,
I was upset about

225
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:33,417
some of the hate
comments I was getting,

226
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:36,260
and I needed to do something
to make myself feel better.

227
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,555
So I did something
that I know you all have done,

228
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,183
so you cannot shame me
when I tell you what I did.

229
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:43,851
But I Googled myself.

230
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,607
See,

231
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,772
I thought if I Googled
myself, I would feel better,

232
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,004
but that's not what happened.

233
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:52,151
What happened was
I noticed these words in bold.

234
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,197
These are the most frequently searched
things on Google.

235
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,823
So I thought I would play with this

236
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,898
and see what you guys
were searching about me,

237
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,162
and I typed in, 'Is Colleen Ballinger...'

238
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,230
And the most frequently searched

239
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,124
thing on Google
when you type in,

240
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,752
'Is Colleen Ballinger...' is...

241
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,003
'dead.'

242
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,508
So that did not
make me feel better.

243
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,843
So I tried something else.

244
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,969
I typed in...

245
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,305
'Did Colleen Ballinger...'

246
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,679
And the most frequently
searched thing on Google

247
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,118
when you type in,
'Did Colleen Ballinger...' is...

248
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:28,439
'die.'

249
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,290
So...

250
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,194
I tried something
a little bit more obscure,

251
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,406
and I typed in,
'Where was Colleen Ballinger...'

252
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,574
thinking there is no way

253
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,744
that this could
be about me dying.

254
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,788
Well, I was wrong
because it was...

255
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,694
'buried.'

256
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,002
So thank you. I love my fans.

257
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:57,011
So when Googling myself
did not make me feel any better,

258
00:11:57,072 --> 00:12:00,200
I did something that I've been
doing since I was a little girl

259
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:01,891
every time I feel low.

260
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:04,330
I wrote in my diary
about my feelings.

261
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,892
Now, this is actually what
inspired my most recent book,

262
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,061
called My Diarrhe
by Miranda Sings.

263
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,212
Some of you brought it.
Thank you.

264
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,578
You guys are the best!

265
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,609
So, yes, I recently
came out with a book,

266
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,365
and it's all of Miranda's
diaries duct-taped together.

267
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,609
Now, the entire
inspiration for this book

268
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,890
was my actual diaries as a child

269
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,203
because they are
horrendously embarrassing.

270
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,539
So I thought, to celebrate
such a special night,

271
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,693
we're doing a Netflix special,

272
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:31,917
we're at the Kennedy
Centre, this is epic.

273
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,544
I should read to you

274
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,448
some of my most
embarrassing pages

275
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:38,424
from my diaries as a child.

276
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:39,507
What do you think?

277
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,177
Yes!

278
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,097
I was gonna do it
even if you didn't scream,

279
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,307
so thank you.

280
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,686
So this is one of my diaries
from when I was a child.

281
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,481
And I found some, uh,

282
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,275
just very embarrassing pages
to read to you guys from.

283
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,277
This is from when I
was about 12 years old,

284
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,052
um, this picture
that I'm about to show you.

285
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,112
Let's take a look.

286
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,531
Yep, there it is.

287
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,574
Oh, God.

288
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,620
So it says...

289
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,748
-It says, 'What's wrong with me?'
-Nothing!

290
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,918
And I'm on the
'road to nowhere.'

291
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,215
I want you guys to get
an idea in your mind

292
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,467
of what I looked like
during this time of my life,

293
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,386
this emo, depressed little girl.

294
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,562
So I brought a picture of
myself for you guys to see...

295
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,850
what I looked like then.

296
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,394
Let's continue.

297
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,062
Here we go.

298
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,981
'Dear Marsha...'

299
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,068
Oh, by the way, I never called
my diary 'diary' for some reason.

300
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,653
I always gave it a name.

301
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,882
I think I thought it would make
me feel like I had friends.

302
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:45,277
So here we go.

303
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,993
'Dear Marsha.'

304
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,747
Sorry I haven't written in a while,
but I have been very busy.

305
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,749
Here are all the things
I have been doing.

306
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,918
One, went to church.

307
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,128
Two, started sixth grade.

308
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,840
Three, got lots of
new Beanie Babies.

309
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,759
'Four, lost my Tamagotchi.'

310
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,804
'Five, practised miming.'

311
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,447
Now, this sounds like a joke,

312
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:12,895
but I legit took mime
classes as a kid.

313
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,040
Uh, I have proof.

314
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,595
This is me...

315
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,982
as a child mime.

316
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,487
Um, I was home-schooled.

317
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,674
Okay, moving on.

318
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,760
So five was 'practised miming.'

319
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,845
-And then, 'Six, my cat ran away.'
-Aww.

320
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,658
'Seven, found my cat.

321
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:28,707
It's dead.'

322
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:29,977
Aww.

323
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,579
'I have been doing a
lot more stuff, too,

324
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,710
but I'm tired and
can't write anymore.'

325
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,286
I most likely will only write

326
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:41,448
when I'm having
problems, or puberty,

327
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,175
or I'm just bored from now on,
so don't expect many letters.

328
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,052
'Good night. Love, Colleen.'

329
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:49,710
Well...

330
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,362
You guys are cheering
'cause you think it's over.

331
00:14:55,423 --> 00:14:57,550
I'm sorry, it's not.
There's more.

332
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,941
So, uh, I did write when
I went through puberty.

333
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,194
So I want to show you one of my
favourite pages from that time.

334
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,783
'Personal note. My boobs are popping
out and they are killing me.'

335
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,745
And I drew a picture in case anyone
wants to know what that looks like.

336
00:15:16,009 --> 00:15:16,892
It hurts.

337
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,337
So puberty did not do me well.

338
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,423
I had a really hard time during
puberty, as most kids do.

339
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,009
And you will see that
reflected on this next page.

340
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,451
'Hate, hate, hate,
hate, hate, hate, hate,

341
00:15:32,512 --> 00:15:34,391
hate, hate, hate
times a million.'

342
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,727
This is my feelings
towards life.

343
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,813
'Lava lamps are really cool...
Colleen Ballinger.'

344
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:41,983
So...

345
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,738
Now, when I was looking for pages
to read to you guys tonight,

346
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:52,576
um, I found this one page in my
diary that is so embarrassing,

347
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,620
so mortifying,

348
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:57,206
that I could not
possibly read it myself.

349
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,457
That's how bad it is.

350
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,961
So I'm going to have the help
of my best friend, Kory DeSoto...

351
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,254
to come read this to you.

352
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,952
This is Kory.

353
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:13,888
Kory.

354
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,602
They love Kory!

355
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,895
I do, too.

356
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,981
He's the best.

357
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,525
So Kory...

358
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,362
is my best friend, and he has
been for many, many years.

359
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,614
Now, Kory and I
met doing theatre,

360
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:35,953
and we have a strange obsession
with bad theatre and bad acting.

361
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:40,249
So I have requested that he
read the worst page of my diary

362
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:44,211
as a bad-acted monologue
for you guys tonight, so...

363
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,714
Oh, by the way, before
he gets started,

364
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,383
I just want to let you know
that this is no ordinary journal.

365
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,635
This is my prayer journal.

366
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:54,795
So these are my thoughts to God.

367
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:55,886
Keep that in mind.

368
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Scene.

369
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,899
'Precious Daddy...'

370
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,377
'I need you to provide me'

371
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,107
with a lot of patience right now

372
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:18,370
because I keep on getting these
dirty looks from this girl...

373
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,247
'Taryn.'

374
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,836
'At the last prayer circle, she asked
for us to pray for her grandma.'

375
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,979
But if she keeps on giving
me these dirty looks,

376
00:17:30,226 --> 00:17:33,730
'I am not gonna pray for her.'

377
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:45,230
'Sorry. Satan got a hold of me there...'

378
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,620
Oh...

379
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,790
'Anyways...'

380
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:06,449
in other news, let's
talk about boys...

381
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,712
or lack thereof.

382
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,590
Am I a mutant or something?

383
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,301
Why can't I get a boyfriend?

384
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,471
'Good times...'

385
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,252
'Not really.'

386
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,770
'Amen.'

387
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:29,583
Give it up for Kory
DeSoto, everybody!

388
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:33,019
Okay.

389
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,775
Now,

390
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:37,491
I could keep reading to you

391
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,410
from my emo high school
and junior high diaries,

392
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:44,289
or I could read to you from
my favourite childhood diary,

393
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,667
which is the poop diary.

394
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,255
Unfortunately, this is
exactly what it sounds like.

395
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,507
My mother, she has four kids,

396
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,252
and she was trying
to figure out a way

397
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,816
to get closer to
us, to bond with us.

398
00:18:57,877 --> 00:19:00,831
Um, she wanted us to open up
to her more about our feelings.

399
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,406
So she came up with
this brilliant idea.

400
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,562
'I know. I'll put a diary
next to the toilet,'

401
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:09,022
and that way, whenever
they're doing that,

402
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,130
'they can write to me
about their feelings.'

403
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,652
She thought this
would help us to bond.

404
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,071
Now, obviously, this
wasn't the greatest idea,

405
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,425
and I have proof, because I'm
going to read you some pages

406
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,033
from the poop diary.

407
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,912
So these are conversations
between me and my mother, okay?

408
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,748
So the first page here,
it starts with my mother.

409
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,875
She asks me...

410
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,769
'How is choir going?'

411
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,377
And I said...

412
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,715
'Fine. I have diariah again!'

413
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,051
'Every time I eat
cheese, I have...'

414
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,335
Arrow to 'diariah.'

415
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,109
So...

416
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,230
My mom's great idea
wasn't really working.

417
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,024
Um, but she didn't
give up, my mother.

418
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,318
She knew this poop
diary would work,

419
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,569
so she tried again.

420
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,477
And I'm gonna read
to you another page.

421
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,198
This one actually
starts with me.

422
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,281
I said...

423
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,076
'That turkey stuff you
made for your diet dinner

424
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,287
smelled better than it taste.'

425
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,997
And then she said,

426
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,874
'Yes, it did.'

427
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,626
And I said,

428
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,463
'I have diariah!'

429
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:17,838
So...

430
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:19,548
it was a good attempt
from my mother,

431
00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:21,970
but obviously, the
poop diary backfired.

432
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,496
But you know what? Actually, my
mom and I are really close now,

433
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,643
so maybe it worked. Moms, try
out poop diaries with your kids.

434
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,562
By the way, I thought
this was a normal thing

435
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,439
that everyone had in their homes

436
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,067
until I was about 16 years old.

437
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,581
So that was an
embarrassing conversation

438
00:20:37,642 --> 00:20:39,112
to have with my
friends in high school

439
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,595
and be like, 'Uh,
where's your poop diary?'

440
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:44,743
Ah.

441
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:46,495
Anyway, let me get rid of this.

442
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,389
So...

443
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,664
listen up.

444
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,083
I know why you guys
are here, all right?

445
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,044
So who's excited to
see Miranda Sings?

446
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,301
All righty.

447
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,180
Let's see if she's ready.

448
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,266
She's not, so I'm
gonna do another song.

449
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,145
But maybe if I sing this,
Miranda will come out to play.

450
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,940
Now, I am a musical
theatre dork.

451
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,235
My background is in theatre.
I love theatre.

452
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,052
And so when I first started
doing Miranda ten years ago,

453
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,573
my entire show was
just Broadway songs.

454
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,447
So I would like
to pay my respects

455
00:21:25,508 --> 00:21:27,290
to the beginning
of Miranda Sings

456
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,622
and sing a theatre song for you
guys right now, if that's cool.

457
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:38,470
Perhaps if I sing this,
Miranda will come out to play.

458
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,860
This is 'Defying Gravity.'

459
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,687
# Something has changed within me #

460
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:57,316
# Something is not the same #

461
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:02,112
# I'm through with playing by the rules #

462
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:06,033
# Of someone else's game #

463
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,619
# Too late for second guessing #

464
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:14,791
# Too late to go back to sleep #

465
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,919
# It's time to trust my instincts #

466
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:24,134
# Close my eyes and leap #

467
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:30,057
# It's time to try defying gravity #

468
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,604
# I think I'll try defying gravity #

469
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,273
# And you can't pull me down... #

470
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,672
# So if you care to find me #

471
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,842
# Look to the western sky #

472
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,428
# For those who told me lately #

473
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:13,600
# Everyone deserves a chance to fly #

474
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,977
# And if I'm flying solo #

475
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,939
# At least I'm flying free #

476
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,941
# To those who'd ground me #

477
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,903
# Take a message back from me #

478
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:30,534
# Tell them how I am defying gravity #

479
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,078
# I'm flying high #

480
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,039
# I'm defying gravity #

481
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:40,502
# And soon I'll match them in renown #

482
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,257
# And nobody in all of Oz #

483
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,802
# No wizard that there is or was #

484
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:54,141
# Is ever going to bring me #

485
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,853
# Down #

486
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:05,485
# Bring me down #

487
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:16,955
# Oh, whoa! #

488
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,600
Hey, guys. It's me, Miranda.

489
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:44,211
I'm so excited to be here
at the Kennedy Centre tonight.

490
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,734
Are you guys excited?

491
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,528
You'd better be excited

492
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,714
'cause you're here to see
the most miraculous,

493
00:24:50,775 --> 00:24:53,488
amazing person in
the entire world,

494
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,315
Miranda Sings!

495
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:00,207
It's true.

496
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,792
I'm the most
incredible person ever.

497
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:07,047
I'm a famous singer, dancer,
actor, model, magician,

498
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,757
other things...

499
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,969
But you guys are in
for a treat tonight

500
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,264
'cause not only do I do all
of those amazing things...

501
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,684
Oh, no. That stuff doesn't
even matter anymore.

502
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,687
You guys are in the
presence of greatness

503
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,358
because tonight,
standing before you

504
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:28,193
is the very next

505
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,320
Virgin Mary!

506
00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:40,430
It's true. I am with child.

507
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,417
I am expecting a little
brat pretty soon.

508
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,585
Now, obviously, I would
never do the nasty,

509
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,982
which means I am the
next Virgin Mary.

510
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,217
But I have some
sceptics out there.

511
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,762
Some people don't think
I'm actually the next Virgin Mary.

512
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,347
Well, I'm about to prove it to you.

513
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,808
You are in the presence
of freaking greatness.

514
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,476
Watch this.

515
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Hit it!

516
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,293
# Halle... # Oh, shoot.

517
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,794
# Hallelujah #

518
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,005
# Hallelujah, hallelujah #

519
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,132
# Hallelujah #

520
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,726
# Look at me, I'm a pregnant queen #

521
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,436
# Baby's coming soon, my poor tookie #

522
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,503
# But it probably won't hurt
because God chose me #

523
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,773
# To be the next Holy Virgin Mary #

524
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,276
# Well, you don't think
I'm the next Virgin Mary? #

525
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:54,195
# A lot of magical things
Have been happening to me lately #

526
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,947
# To prove I'm the chosen one #

527
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,408
# Currently have two brains in me #

528
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,244
# So I'm double smarter than everybody #

529
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:02,182
# When I sneeze, I pee simultaneously #

530
00:27:02,243 --> 00:27:03,934
# I don't need a table
I just use my belly #

531
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:05,980
# Haven't pooped in weeks
And I'm still alive #

532
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,899
# Got a tiny little penis in me
At all times #

533
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,919
# I see everything, I've got four eyes #

534
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,505
# And my booty's looking thick
'Cause I've got four thighs #

535
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,710
# Do the waddle, do the waddle #

536
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,315
# Do the waddle, do the waddle #

537
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,288
# Before he comes out
He needs to repent #

538
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,331
# He's kicking and grabbing me
Without my consent #

539
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,417
# Stop grabbing my tookie
Or I'll make you pay rent #

540
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,063
# If he keeps it up
He could become the next president #

541
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,323
# Virgin Miranda #

542
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:44,162
# The holiest of all #

543
00:27:53,113 --> 00:27:55,574
See, just proved it.

544
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,637
I am the next Virgin
Holy Miranda, all right?

545
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,339
Now, when I announced
this on the internet,

546
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,768
I had a lot of people
being very offended

547
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:08,937
that I said I was
the next Virgin Mary.

548
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,230
Which is ridiculous!

549
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:11,439
Look at these comments.

550
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:14,067
People are saying things
like, 'I'm affended.'

551
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,778
'This video offiended me.'

552
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,406
'Ew, Ur preginanit.'

553
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:21,866
But you know what?

554
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,453
I realized people
are gonna be offended

555
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,039
whether I'm preginanit or not.

556
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:32,652
Because everybody is offended
by everything these days.

557
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:34,173
It's ridiculous!

558
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,779
You can't do anything
without offending someone.

559
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,217
It's so annoying.

560
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,424
Like, I can't even post
an Instagram picture

561
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:44,097
without ticking someone off.

562
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,180
Look at these, okay.

563
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,851
This picture
offended the vegans.

564
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,353
This picture
offended the mothers.

565
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:53,420
This picture offended... everyone.

566
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,568
So friggin' annoying.

567
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,530
But then I realized something.
I was doing it all wrong.

568
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,951
Because you can actually
say whatever you want

569
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,868
and do whatever you want

570
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,536
and not get in trouble for it,

571
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,038
as long as you say
two little words.

572
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,498
No offence!

573
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,584
That's right. 'No offence.'

574
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,544
Hit it!

575
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:18,006
Listen up, leotards. I'm about
to teach you two magic words

576
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,696
that make it so you can
say whatever you want,

577
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:22,649
whenever you want,
and not suffer consequences.

578
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:26,164
# Feel like you're offending everyone
These days? #

579
00:29:26,688 --> 00:29:30,483
# Feel like you're losing friends
No matter what you say? #

580
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:35,023
# There's a way to say offensive things
And not look bad #

581
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:39,319
# Just say these two little words
And no one's allowed to be mad #

582
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:42,197
# I hope you get a paper cut #

583
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:44,032
# No offence #

584
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:46,304
# Even your grandma thinks you suck #

585
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,328
# No offence #

586
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,914
# Your face looks exactly like your butt #

587
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,582
# No offence #

588
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,168
# I bet Comic Sans is your favourite font #

589
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,003
# No offence #

590
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,969
See, that's all you gotta say.

591
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,143
In a normal situation,

592
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:07,847
you go up to someone
and say, 'You're ugly.'

593
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,973
That's really rude.

594
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,352
But if you just finish it off
with, 'You're ugly. No offence,'

595
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:13,645
they can't get mad.

596
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,559
See? Now,

597
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:18,867
some of my haters have
yet to learn this lesson.

598
00:30:18,928 --> 00:30:20,756
They're saying very rude,
offensive things to me

599
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:24,364
and not saying, 'No offence,'
which is really titting me off,

600
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,033
and I'm gonna show you right
now what I'm talking about.

601
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,637
People are telling
me that I did porn

602
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,538
in order to get pregnant.

603
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,243
Which is not true.

604
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,375
I would never
participate in the nasty.

605
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,649
Now, I need to prove it to you

606
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:40,171
so I can prove that I'm
actually the next Virgin Mary.

607
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,549
So I'm gonna prove I would
never participate in a porn.

608
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,948
Now, what you might not know

609
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:47,345
is that porn is
happening all around you.

610
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:51,266
Even right now, there are people
being porn in this very room,

611
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,767
and I cannot have that.

612
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:56,020
So I'm going to need two
volunteers right now.

613
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:58,647
Hmm.

614
00:30:59,196 --> 00:31:00,155
Let's see here.

615
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,360
Um, how about you right
here in the red pants?

616
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,443
I need one more.

617
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:06,114
There's a lot of you.

618
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,033
Um, how about in the skirt, right here?
Yeah, in the skirt.

619
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,117
Come on up.

620
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,120
Hello.

621
00:31:12,512 --> 00:31:14,096
-What's your name?
-Calita.

622
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:15,850
Calita!

623
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,767
Wow, do you have a dragon?

624
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:20,396
Is that you, the
Mother of the Dragons?

625
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:21,847
No.

626
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,817
I got you confused
with someone else.

627
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,134
So anyways...

628
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:27,317
Hi. Okay.

629
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:28,722
So...

630
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,202
Listen, in order to talk
about this first type of porn,

631
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,807
I'm gonna need my pointer.

632
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:36,412
I really want to make sure you
guys are paying attention, okay?

633
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,354
So just give me a second.

634
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:40,606
Okay.

635
00:31:42,418 --> 00:31:43,418
Listen up.

636
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,577
Calita over here

637
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,519
is wearing a nice button-up shirt
all the way to the tippity top,

638
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,534
nice long sleeves,

639
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,287
pants that go all the
way down to the floor.

640
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,905
This is very nice.
Very conservative.

641
00:31:57,966 --> 00:32:01,720
This is a perfect example of not porn.

642
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,713
This...

643
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:07,369
is porn, okay?

644
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,053
Her skirt is so short,

645
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,847
all it will take is one
really big gust of wind

646
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,558
and we'll see all the
creases and crevices.

647
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,729
And the top goes so low we can
the entire chesticle crack.

648
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:22,607
This is a perfect
example of porn.

649
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,233
-So what's your name?
-Sarah.

650
00:32:24,623 --> 00:32:25,739
Exactly.

651
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:28,555
No offence.

652
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,743
So here we have porn, not porn.

653
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,453
Porn, not porn.

654
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:37,664
Do not fret, Sarah. I'mma help you out.

655
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,082
I know you're a Mirfanda.

656
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:43,169
However, give Calita
a round of applause.

657
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:45,588
Thank you.

658
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,672
Go away.

659
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,216
Get off. Okay.

660
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,259
Come here, Sarah.

661
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,220
Oh, this is bad news.

662
00:32:52,545 --> 00:32:57,508
Listen, you are in the presence
of a biblical holy figure, okay?

663
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:00,937
I cannot have my Mirfandas
walking around dressed porn-y,

664
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,313
so I gotta fix this.

665
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,399
Lucky for you, I brought
something with me tonight

666
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,484
in case there was a Sarah here.

667
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,988
I use this whenever I see
someone looking porn-ish.

668
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:10,783
Okay?

669
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:13,888
This is the stretchy
solution to porn.

670
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:16,953
So what you do is, whenever
you see someone dressed porn,

671
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,458
you just put this
on their head...

672
00:33:20,183 --> 00:33:21,183
and then you just...

673
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,877
Like this. See?

674
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,796
Very nice.

675
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,339
However...

676
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,719
she is such a severe
case of the porn.

677
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,886
Turn around.

678
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,386
This is so tight, we can see the
entire shape of the badonkadonk.

679
00:33:37,447 --> 00:33:38,828
Inappropriate!

680
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,458
Which means this needs
to go, all right?

681
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,062
This is never going to work.

682
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,197
There is only one
thing that we can do

683
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,026
for someone who is
this porn-y, okay?

684
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,611
This I only do in severe cases,

685
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,821
so please,

686
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:52,904
help me...

687
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,324
and pray for Sarah.

688
00:33:55,589 --> 00:33:56,784
Okay?

689
00:33:56,974 --> 00:33:58,338
Thank you, Sarah.

690
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,079
Thank you. Goodbye.

691
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,919
Okay. Listen, I can't have that.

692
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,881
I can't have my Mirfandas
dressing porn-y, okay?

693
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,257
You represent me now.

694
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,093
So everybody, look to your
left, look to your right,

695
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,304
see if anybody's dressed
porn-y right now.

696
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,598
Put a hand on them
and pray for them.

697
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,768
Let's get rid of the porn
together, one prayer at a time.

698
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,520
Very good, yes.

699
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,899
Very nice. Oh, this girl's praying
for her mom in the front row.

700
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,734
What the heck?

701
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,446
The mom's all happy.
She's like, 'I am porn.'

702
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:36,666
Okay.

703
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,788
Now, listen, I wish that was the
only type of porn that there is,

704
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,831
but there's lots
of types of porn.

705
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,209
And this next type of porn
is the most common

706
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,877
and the worst one of all.

707
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,061
It's porn-style dancing.

708
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:51,589
I know you kids.

709
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,842
You like to go out to
da club and bust a move.

710
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,054
But I don't want to see you doing
any of these nasty booty shakes

711
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,362
and booty twerks.

712
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:01,258
It's disgusting
and inappropriate.

713
00:35:01,327 --> 00:35:04,205
The only type of dancing
my Mirfandas should be doing

714
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:05,828
is my type of dancing.

715
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,231
So if you know it,
I want to see you do it.

716
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,983
This is 'Do The Miranda!'

717
00:35:10,044 --> 00:35:11,651
Hit it!

718
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:15,071
All right, Miranda
Sings in the house!

719
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,280
Get up out of your seats.

720
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,037
I want to see you dancing
right now, having a good time.

721
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,910
All right. Here we go.

722
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,363
# Hey, you over there
With the porn-y hair #

723
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,248
# I got what you need #

724
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,084
# Hey, you there, bro
With the camel toe #

725
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,253
# Come and just follow my lead #

726
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,800
# A new dance is here
And I fear, my dear #

727
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,828
# That you're all looking like hoes #

728
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:37,642
# So cover your backs
And your chesticle cracks #

729
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,720
# 'Cause here is how it goes #

730
00:35:40,021 --> 00:35:42,329
# Lift your legs up high
Poke your neighbour in the eye #

731
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,725
# Paint a rainbow in the sky
Wipe it till it's dry #

732
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,186
# Then twerk like me
But don't make it slutty #

733
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,647
# It's as easy as can be, so follow me #

734
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,365
# Let's do it again #

735
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,615
# Do the Miranda #

736
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,120
# Oh, yeah #

737
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,289
# Do the Miranda #

738
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,209
# Do the Miranda! #

739
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,507
Very nice.

740
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,678
I see lots of you know
how to do the Miranda.

741
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,846
Very good.

742
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,098
I saw some of you
not participating.

743
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,266
Mothers.

744
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,062
So congratulations.
You will never get a boyfriend.

745
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,155
No offence.

746
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,483
Okay, listen.

747
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:39,539
We have a lot to
discuss tonight.

748
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:42,349
I can't spend this much
time on freaking porn,

749
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,994
so we got to move on
to the next thing, okay?

750
00:36:45,177 --> 00:36:48,581
Because, listen, there's one
thing that the Virgin Mary had

751
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:49,790
that I don't have yet.

752
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,626
This is a problem, okay?

753
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,294
She had a Joseph.

754
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,255
I don't have a Joseph
yet to my Mary.

755
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,216
So I got a question for you.

756
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:00,718
Where my baes at?

757
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,932
# I'm about to break it down #

758
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,808
# Sing along if you know it #

759
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,727
# All right, here we go #

760
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,104
# Every time I look around
All I ever see #

761
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,440
# Is people being jealous
And they wanna look like me #

762
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,692
# I've got Tyler, Ricky, Joey
And the Dolan twins too #

763
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,945
# My uncle and Lohanthony
But I'm my favourite boo #

764
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,947
# Got a lot more
But I forgot who they are #

765
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,324
# Sorry, not sorry
Just a superstar #

766
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,660
# Got lots of baes
Are you wondering how I do? #

767
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,703
# Take a little listen
I'll find a bae for you #

768
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,081
# Hey, where my baes at? #

769
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,416
# Where my baes at? #

770
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,543
# I got so many baes, man #

771
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,796
# I'll teach you how to get one too #

772
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,173
# Where my baes at in the house? #

773
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:44,712
Whoa, so many baes.

774
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,097
You know what, guys?

775
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,032
I'm not joking around.

776
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,393
I really need to find a bae.

777
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,520
I am six months
pregnant already,

778
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,648
so I need to find a
daddy to this kid.

779
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,509
Love you, Patrick!

780
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,760
Hi, Patrick.

781
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:26,971
Hey, Miranda.

782
00:38:31,151 --> 00:38:33,205
Patrick, what are you doing here?

783
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:35,813
I haven't seen you
in, like, six months.

784
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,985
Uh... Well, I...

785
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,539
I heard the, um...

786
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:44,822
That you, uh...

787
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,033
That you're with
child, and, um...

788
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:50,865
I thought maybe you could
use some protection.

789
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,582
Patrick...

790
00:38:56,207 --> 00:38:57,917
It's a little late for that.

791
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,716
Besides, we can't be together.
You know this.

792
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:06,760
Netflix owns the rights to you,
and the show got cancelled.

793
00:39:06,821 --> 00:39:08,322
I could get sued.

794
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,621
So you need to go.
I don't want to get sued.

795
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,016
I don't have insurance.

796
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,559
Go away. Hurry.

797
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:16,992
Before anyone sees. Yes.
Please go, Patrick, please.

798
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,611
Oh, don't give me that.
I didn't cancel the show!

799
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,752
Just kidding. I'm grateful
for the experience.

800
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,923
I love Netflix so much.

801
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,588
You know, I can't eat this.

802
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:47,510
It makes the baby
kick me in my tookie,

803
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,719
so does anyone want it?

804
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,538
What about in the balcony?

805
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,655
Do you want it up there?

806
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:53,968
Get ready.

807
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,522
That was for you.

808
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,316
Now, listen, okay.
I wasn't kidding.

809
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,973
Before I was rudely
interrupted by Patrick,

810
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,696
I really do have a surprise
for you guys tonight.

811
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,033
We all know I need to get
a daddy to this baby ASAP,

812
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,120
so I called up my number-one bae

813
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,789
and said I was doing
a very special show tonight

814
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,291
in Washington DC at
the Kennedy Centre.

815
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,878
This guy has millions
of subscribers,

816
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,672
millions of views,

817
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,173
very, very famous.

818
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,592
My number-one bae.
Do you know who it is?

819
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,890
Joey Graceffa!

820
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,226
But he said he
couldn't come, so...

821
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:42,606
That would have been
great, though, huh,

822
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:43,858
if he was here.

823
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,862
The parents are all
laughing at their kids.

824
00:40:48,554 --> 00:40:50,556
They're crying.

825
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,951
You know what?
He's not here, but you guys are.

826
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,328
Who wants to be my bae tonight?

827
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:00,124
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

828
00:41:00,185 --> 00:41:01,459
Stop. Are you kidding me?

829
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:03,335
I see so many girls
raising their hands.

830
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,004
I'm not a Lebanese.

831
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,423
Boys, please. No offence.

832
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,467
Let's see here.

833
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,760
We got lots of options. Ooh.

834
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,513
How about in the white
sweatshirt up there?

835
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,806
I need two more.

836
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,308
Two more.

837
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,435
Who do we got? Who do we got?

838
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,437
Okay, in the black hat.

839
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,605
I need one more.

840
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,857
Come on up, white
sweatshirt, black hat.

841
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,275
One more.

842
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,152
So many good options.

843
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,113
Okay, how about in the
purple shirt right here?

844
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:33,025
Come on up.

845
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,202
Ooh, hello.

846
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,372
Look at this sexy bae.

847
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,875
What is your name?

848
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,713
Nathan.

849
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,878
Nathan. Love that.

850
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,796
I love your face hairs.

851
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,007
Where are you from?

852
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,425
Barrie, Ontario.

853
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,469
Barrie, Ontario?

854
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,096
Oh. Sounds like an infection.

855
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,908
Oh, hey, Daddy.

856
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,505
What's your name?

857
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,561
My name is Anthony.

858
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,146
-Andronen? What?
-Anthony.

859
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,032
Anthony!

860
00:42:05,093 --> 00:42:05,718
Okay.

861
00:42:05,864 --> 00:42:07,777
You did not say that the first time.
Just saying.

862
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,777
Anthony, where are you from?

863
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,696
I'm from Bayonne, New Jersey. 'Bay.'

864
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,036
-Bayonne. I'm the bae.
-Ooh.

865
00:42:14,097 --> 00:42:15,138
I get it.

866
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:16,689
Whatever.

867
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,060
Good talk. Okay.

868
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,873
Oh, hey. You're much
shorter up close.

869
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,415
Um, what's your name?

870
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:25,751
Aldair.

871
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,799
Are you related to Andrew
over there, All-dayer?

872
00:42:32,466 --> 00:42:33,551
Yeah.

873
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,303
'Sure. That works.' Aldair.

874
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,264
I love it. It's
like, 'All-dayer!'

875
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,392
'I could do an all-dayer!'

876
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,980
Good. Okay.

877
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,257
Cool.

878
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,527
Um, where are you from, Aldair?

879
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,070
My mom's belly.

880
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,248
What do you do for a living?

881
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,584
Uh...

882
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,544
watch you on YouTube.

883
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,049
We have a flirt in
the house tonight.

884
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,218
Okay, Aldair.

885
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:18,907
Love that.

886
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,883
Now, I have three
very sexy men...

887
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,827
boys on stage.

888
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,426
All of them...

889
00:43:27,526 --> 00:43:31,835
are ready and excited to be
the father to this child.

890
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:40,159
Um, so you can all handle
this responsibility, you think?

891
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,329
Promising.

892
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,278
Okay. Now, here's the deal.

893
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:48,592
I can't have all three
of them being the daddy,

894
00:43:48,753 --> 00:43:51,172
so I'm gonna pick one,
but how I'm gonna do that

895
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,729
is I'm gonna woo them

896
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:56,467
with my charms and my talents
and my vocal abilities.

897
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,636
And whoever I have the
most chemistry with

898
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,513
will become the
daddy to this child.

899
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:04,600
So all you guys have to do
is stay right where you are.

900
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,935
I will come to you,
so just come...

901
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,729
Oh, yes. You can come to me.

902
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,775
I will be doing all of the work.

903
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,860
If the chemistry is
there, it's there.

904
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,945
-All right? Are you ready for it?
-Absolutely.

905
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,280
Hit it!

906
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,843
# What up, everybody? New year, new me #

907
00:44:20,904 --> 00:44:23,323
# You can smell me coming
Like asparagus pee #

908
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,829
# I'm so sexy, I'm just like a zit #

909
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:28,332
# That's what everybody stares at
And you want to touch it #

910
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,292
# Oh, oh, oh #

911
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,319
# You see me walking by
And you are shook #

912
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:45,224
# Summer loving, had me a blast #

913
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:49,102
# Summer loving, happened so fast #

914
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,815
# Met a boy, crazy for me #

915
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,984
# Met a boy, cute as can be #

916
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,074
# Summer dreams #

917
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:06,537
# Ripped at the seams #

918
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,330
# But #

919
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,041
# Oh #

920
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:17,256
# Those summer #

921
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:25,649
# Nights #

922
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,532
Wow.

923
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,161
There is so much chemistry
on stage right now.

924
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,940
Like I said,

925
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:52,560
I can only pick one bae to
be the daddy to this child,

926
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,669
so I'm gonna get out something
called the bae-ometer.

927
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,922
The bae-ometer also
happens to be my hand.

928
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,326
So I'm just gonna take it,

929
00:46:00,387 --> 00:46:01,592
put it over their head,

930
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:04,303
and the bae you think
I had the most chemistry with,

931
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,554
cheer for, okay?

932
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:06,637
So here we go.

933
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,602
Pretty good. Pretty good.

934
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,693
Oh.

935
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,705
This is so awkward. I won.

936
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,899
But give them a round of applause.
They did such a good job.

937
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,961
Call me when you're
older, Aldair.

938
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,880
Thank you. Go away.

939
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:42,216
You can leave now. Get away.

940
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,762
Well, now I'm single.

941
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,179
So...

942
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,017
Don't worry, guys, okay?
Don't worry.

943
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,534
I can handle the responsibility
of being the mother

944
00:46:55,757 --> 00:46:58,106
and the father to this baby.

945
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,483
Easy-peasy.

946
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,820
I have been preparing for
this moment my entire life.

947
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,863
I was born holy.

948
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,449
Born the holiest of holes.

949
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,492
And I have proof.

950
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,460
I have been acting
like and dressing like

951
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:14,706
biblical characters
my entire life.

952
00:47:14,767 --> 00:47:16,936
I have pictures from when
I was a wee little tot

953
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:20,462
dressing like every famous
biblical character there ever was.

954
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:21,505
Look at this.

955
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,425
Here is me as an angel,

956
00:47:23,486 --> 00:47:25,113
me as Moses,

957
00:47:25,174 --> 00:47:26,759
me as mother Mary,

958
00:47:26,923 --> 00:47:28,508
me, the prostitute.

959
00:47:29,189 --> 00:47:30,042
See?

960
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:33,669
Every single biblical
character I have played.

961
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:35,448
Not only that. Look
at this picture.

962
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,265
That's me with the
circle around her.

963
00:47:37,326 --> 00:47:38,893
I'm putting on a
play in the backyard

964
00:47:38,954 --> 00:47:40,274
with some neighbourhood friends.

965
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,067
'What's the play?'
You might ask.

966
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:45,362
The crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

967
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:47,614
See, there's the
cross, right up there.

968
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,993
We're about to kill that little boy,
and I am really ticked off.

969
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:55,183
Not only did I do plays and
act like a biblical character,

970
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,189
but I also always
was very charitable,

971
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,168
and I was very compassionate.

972
00:48:00,229 --> 00:48:02,123
Here, you'll see me
being compassionate,

973
00:48:02,184 --> 00:48:04,548
not only towards
people, but to animals.

974
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:07,217
Here, I'm playing with my
favourite pet I ever had.

975
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,219
Right there, Charlie the Fly.

976
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,790
Next.

977
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,974
Oh. This is me doing
some charity work.

978
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,935
As you can see, the hardest
charity work there is,

979
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,596
hanging out with a girl
with really ugly bangs.

980
00:48:20,136 --> 00:48:21,064
So...

981
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,984
That was a tough day for me.
Emotional.

982
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:24,902
Next.

983
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,904
Oh, here's me doing
more charity work.

984
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:30,449
I'm singing for complete
strangers for free.

985
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,533
Look, they love it.

986
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,120
This guy on this end,
he's like, 'Yaas!'

987
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:37,748
So... Next.

988
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,598
Oh, this is great
'cause it shows

989
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:41,877
how everyone has
always adored me,

990
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,149
setting me up for a
life of being adored

991
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,453
by everyone as the
Virgin Miranda.

992
00:48:46,514 --> 00:48:47,890
These boys love me.

993
00:48:48,003 --> 00:48:48,960
They adore me.

994
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:50,449
They want to be with me so bad,

995
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,971
they can't even keep
their shirts on.

996
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,140
So these are my cousins.

997
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,645
You know, growing up, for me,
was always really easy

998
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,272
'cause I was always the most
popularest girl in school,

999
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,191
president of the drama club,

1000
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:07,194
homecoming queen, prom
king, everything, so...

1001
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,779
Being home-schooled is great.

1002
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:14,076
And it really helped prepare me
to become the Virgin Miranda.

1003
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:14,897
But you know what?

1004
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:16,277
I don't want to stand up here

1005
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:18,521
and just brag about
how amazing I am.

1006
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,124
I need to show you
how amazing I am.

1007
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,778
So how would you
guys like if I did

1008
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:25,397
some charity work
for you tonight?

1009
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,925
That's what I thought.

1010
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,012
I'm gonna give you the best
gift anyone could ever receive

1011
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,681
in the entire world.

1012
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:39,170
I'm going to make all
of you internet famous!

1013
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,479
That's what I thought.

1014
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,438
Now, listen.

1015
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:45,899
I'm gonna do a
video for you guys,

1016
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,402
so say hello to the internet!

1017
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,954
# Say hello to the internet #

1018
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,084
Hello! We're so famous!

1019
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:09,080
There you go, guys.

1020
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,300
Wow!

1021
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,886
You guys are gonna get
so famous from that.

1022
00:50:14,976 --> 00:50:17,729
Millions of people will see that

1023
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:19,926
if I ever choose to post it.

1024
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:21,852
It's crazy.

1025
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,938
Oh, shoot. I just realized something.
Oh, no!

1026
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,274
I just made you all
internet famous,

1027
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:30,444
and that means you guys are
all gonna start getting haters.

1028
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,403
It's true!

1029
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:34,406
When you get famous on the
internet, you get tons of haters,

1030
00:50:34,475 --> 00:50:36,019
so I need to teach
you guys how to deal

1031
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,266
with these freaking
bullies online, okay?

1032
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,954
Because, listen, you could
be minding your own business

1033
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,789
and post an innocent
little video.

1034
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,833
Something like this.
Where My Baes At?

1035
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,460
A classic music video,

1036
00:50:46,555 --> 00:50:49,641
and you could end up
with hate comments like this...

1037
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:53,925
'If she were any more inbred,
she would be a sandwich.'

1038
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,094
See what I'm saying?

1039
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:57,940
It doesn't end there.
Look at this one.

1040
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,037
'You suck @, go to @.

1041
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:02,642
No one likes you, okay,
so stop singing and @.'

1042
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:05,437
Okay, listen. The worst
part about this hate mail

1043
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,276
is not the fact that
they said a bad word,

1044
00:51:07,337 --> 00:51:09,274
it's not the fact they
told me to go die,

1045
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,568
it's the fact that it
was written by a baby!

1046
00:51:12,324 --> 00:51:13,435
Look at that.

1047
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:17,562
You can't trust
babies these days.

1048
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,785
Look at this one.

1049
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,913
'Ugly piece of @.
I hope you @-ing die.'

1050
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:26,097
Now, Joe Bob responded to
his own comment and he said,

1051
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,251
'Subscribe to me, please.'

1052
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,587
No, thank you.

1053
00:51:30,934 --> 00:51:31,737
See what I'm saying?

1054
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:33,728
You're gonna get hate like
this every single day,

1055
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,116
and it doesn't matter what
kind of videos you post online.

1056
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,177
They hate on all of them.

1057
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,180
Look at this incredible video.
The Slurpee Bath video.

1058
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,766
This is quality content, folks.

1059
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,498
And I got hate on this.

1060
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,687
Look at these comments.

1061
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:52,125
'She looks like the type of girl
who would microwave her hamster.'

1062
00:51:53,642 --> 00:51:55,333
That was one time!

1063
00:51:59,288 --> 00:51:59,974
Next.

1064
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,411
'What the @ you trying to
do to people, dread?'

1065
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,098
You in some kind @-ing
mad people home owa?

1066
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,833
Lord, have mercy.

1067
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,584
Girl, hush your blasty mouth.

1068
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,212
Nah. Set-ups. Only squawk,
squawk, squawk, squawk.

1069
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,297
'You a @ parrot. Hush.'

1070
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,132
Well...

1071
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:18,844
MaddiNawwy is ticked off.

1072
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,803
Next.

1073
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,223
'You remind me of me. LOL.'

1074
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,183
Now, at first, I thought
this was a fan mail

1075
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,936
until I realized
it was from Anus!

1076
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,439
I don't want to
remind you of an anus.

1077
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,568
It's not even the
best part of the butt.

1078
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,572
Now, the worst hate
mail I ever even gotted

1079
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:41,920
was on one of my most incredible
music videos of all time,

1080
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:43,076
Shake It Off.

1081
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:44,579
This is a classic.

1082
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,372
But I did get hate on it,

1083
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,707
and here it is.

1084
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,417
'The entire video,

1085
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,671
I was wondering how she was
covering her monster size p-word.'

1086
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:56,464
Are you kidding me?

1087
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,841
I'm circumcised.

1088
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:01,647
Next.

1089
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,186
'Miranda, I'm little Russian boy
and I say you are slut and ugly.'

1090
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,235
How rude.

1091
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:18,986
Now, listen.

1092
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,240
There is one more hate mail
I have to share with you.

1093
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,694
It's the perfect
example of a hater.

1094
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:25,826
Here it is.

1095
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,408
'My dad came in, and
I switched to porn

1096
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:31,977
because it was
easier to explain.'

1097
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,317
So frigging wrong.

1098
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:41,579
That's the type of hate I
deal with every single day,

1099
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,486
and it's the type of hate all of you
guys are gonna have to deal with,

1100
00:53:44,547 --> 00:53:45,590
now that you're famous.

1101
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,933
But you know what?
I know how to deal with this.

1102
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,769
All you've got to do is say,
'Haters, back off.'

1103
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:51,895
Let me hear you say it.

1104
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,397
Haters, back off!

1105
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:58,902
Exactly! You say, 'Haters, back off,'
to anyone who's bullying you,

1106
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,362
anyone who's hating on you.

1107
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:02,891
Your moms, your pets,
your carpets, your uncles.

1108
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:04,887
I don't care who it is
'cause you know what?

1109
00:54:04,948 --> 00:54:07,832
Nobody bullies my Mirfandas,
except for me.

1110
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:10,914
It's true.

1111
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:13,446
Now, you know what?

1112
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:16,933
I've been doing a lot of incredible
things for you guys tonight,

1113
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:19,905
but now it's time
for me to do you

1114
00:54:19,966 --> 00:54:22,108
the greatest honour
of your lives.

1115
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:26,130
I'm going to baptise you
all in the name of myself.

1116
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,690
Are you ready for it?

1117
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,392
This is gonna be an
incredible moment for you.

1118
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,521
Now, in the church of myself,

1119
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,022
how you baptise someone

1120
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,316
is you show them
all of your talents.

1121
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,027
So I'm gonna show you
that I'm not just a triple threat.

1122
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,529
I am a five threat.

1123
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,781
Acting, singing, dancing,
modelling, magician.

1124
00:54:44,842 --> 00:54:47,231
And I'm about to do
all five of my talents

1125
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:49,180
on this stage to
baptise you all.

1126
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,747
The first of many talents
is my modelling abilities.

1127
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,875
You guys are about to see me
do the most incredible modelling,

1128
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,754
runway walk, fashion show
you've ever seen in your entire life,

1129
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,465
so get ready to have your
minds freaking blown.

1130
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,259
Get ready for this.

1131
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,957
# Your strip is served #

1132
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:46,301
# Model, model, model, model #

1133
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:50,096
# Model, model, model, model #

1134
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:01,602
That was incredible.

1135
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,612
But you guys are not baptised yet.
Oh, no.

1136
00:56:05,673 --> 00:56:08,926
I know you probably are feeling
very baptised and holy,

1137
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:12,285
but you won't be baptised and
holy until I do all my talents.

1138
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:17,082
So the next talent is my dancing ability.
Who wants to see that?

1139
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:22,692
Good, 'cause you're about to.

1140
00:56:22,801 --> 00:56:24,157
I'm about to blow your minds.

1141
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,755
I'm gonna do every trendy,

1142
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:29,677
iconic dance move that
has ever been created.

1143
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,958
Hit it!

1144
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,515
I'm about to prove I'm the
best dancer in the world.

1145
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,716
Get ready!

1146
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,312
# Dab, dab #

1147
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,147
# Dab, dab #

1148
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:45,110
# Running man, running man
Run, run, running man #

1149
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,780
# Whip and the nae nae
Whip and the nae nae #

1150
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,198
# Floss, floss #

1151
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,450
# I don't need a dentist
I floss #

1152
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:56,121
# Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot #

1153
00:56:58,009 --> 00:56:58,798
Stop.

1154
00:56:59,137 --> 00:57:00,727
This isn't good enough.

1155
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,094
I really need to step
it up a notch here

1156
00:57:03,155 --> 00:57:05,187
if I'm gonna baptise
you guys, okay?

1157
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:09,352
I can't keep doing one talent at a time.
We'll be here forever.

1158
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,327
So to finish everything off

1159
00:57:11,527 --> 00:57:14,013
and to make sure you
are fully baptised,

1160
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,100
I'm going to do
all of my talents,

1161
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,436
the remaining
talents I need to do,

1162
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,562
at one time.

1163
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,815
My acting, my singing,
and my magicianry.

1164
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,233
Are you ready for this?

1165
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,741
Once I do this,

1166
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,119
you will all
officially be baptised,

1167
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:39,456
and you will be part of the Holy
Church of the Virgin Miranda.

1168
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,167
So get ready to have
your minds exploded.

1169
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,919
But first, I need the help
of my assistant, Patrick.

1170
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,399
Welcome him to the stage.

1171
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:55,929
It's all right.

1172
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:58,248
As far as I know, I still
don't have the rights to you,

1173
00:57:58,314 --> 00:58:01,406
so just, um, close your eyes
when you're looking at him,

1174
00:58:01,467 --> 00:58:03,414
but keep them open when
you're looking at me so that

1175
00:58:03,617 --> 00:58:04,655
it's like he's not here.

1176
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:05,982
So try that.

1177
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,694
All right. So I'm about to
do an incredible magic trick.

1178
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:12,864
This is going to go around
my neck and lock shut.

1179
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,992
Patrick is going to take
this very sharp sword.

1180
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:19,412
He's gonna stick it
through my neck, like so,

1181
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,134
whilst I am singing,

1182
00:58:21,195 --> 00:58:23,739
and it will not affect
my vocal chords at all.

1183
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:24,834
Not only that,

1184
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,877
I'm gonna be doing the best acting
you've ever seen in your life

1185
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,412
because the best type
of music to act to

1186
00:58:30,537 --> 00:58:32,308
and to sing to at the same time

1187
00:58:32,473 --> 00:58:34,058
is opera music.

1188
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:39,140
So I'm gonna be singing a
famous opera song in Italian.

1189
00:58:39,438 --> 00:58:43,650
So get ready to have your
minds freaking blown.

1190
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:44,896
Hit it!

1191
00:58:45,498 --> 00:58:47,318
Stick it in me whenever
you want, Patrick.

1192
00:58:50,084 --> 00:58:56,174
# O mio babbino caro #

1193
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:05,166
# Mi piace bello #

1194
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:09,123
# Bello #

1195
00:59:09,285 --> 00:59:15,040
# A pizza with meatballs and pepperoni
And a sausage #

1196
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:19,973
# Yo quiero Taco Bell #

1197
00:59:21,497 --> 00:59:23,833
# Mi struggo #

1198
00:59:24,216 --> 00:59:29,847
# E mi tormento #

1199
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,432
# O Dio #

1200
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,660
# Vorrei #

1201
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:46,624
# Morir #

1202
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:51,045
Aah!

1203
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,094
Thank you, guys!
You've been a great audience.

1204
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,721
You're all baptised.

1205
00:59:59,782 --> 01:00:01,119
Have a great night.

1206
01:00:11,554 --> 01:00:14,431
'Why are you a YouTuber?
I'm not a hater. I just hate your vids.

1207
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,569
And your voice.'

1208
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,961
'You look uglier than my ass.

1209
01:00:18,171 --> 01:00:19,258
No ofoinse.'

1210

'Does she have cancer?

1211
01:00:21,694 --> 01:00:23,336
'Cause I don't want to make
fun of her if she does.

1212
01:00:23,397 --> 01:00:25,038
She's so effing annoying.'

1213
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,637
'Your cloths are so ugly.'

1214
01:00:26,698 --> 01:00:28,496
Maybe you need to
go to a model class.

1215
01:00:28,557 --> 01:00:29,315
Your cloths look like pyjamas.

1216
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,396
'You don't know
what you're wearing.

1217
01:00:30,457 --> 01:00:32,974
You look good to you.
You look bad to me.'
