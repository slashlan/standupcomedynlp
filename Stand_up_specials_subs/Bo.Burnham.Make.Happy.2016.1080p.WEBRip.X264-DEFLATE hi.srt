654
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:51,876
I, uh...

655
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,295
I don't love my fans.

656
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,799
I have to be...
I don't. You don't want that...

657
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,219
You don't want that desperate,
sort of cloying thing from an entertainer.

658

they stick with me through everything,

659

Do not stick with me through thick.

660

If I stop entertaining you,
throw me to the curb.

661

You wouldn't stick with your mechanic
if he stopped fixing your car.

662
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:13,523
I'm in a service industry.
I'm just overpaid, okay?

664
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,986

pop artists especially,

665
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,988
sort of infringe upon...

666
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,283
responsibilities that just aren't theirs,
in terms of their audience,

667
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,661
maintaining their audience
at an emotional level.

668
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,621
Some of you might be sad
and going through things.

669
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,498
I feel for that.
Life is tough.

670
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,959
I'm not gonna fix that with a song.

671
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:36,254
Like "Brave" or "Roar."
You know these inspirational...

672
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,672
What I'm trying to say...

673
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,343

844
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,763
performing...

845
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,264
-I try to...
-[person whistling]

846
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:08,766
...make my show about other things,

847
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,102
but it always ends up
becoming about performing.

848
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,855
I started performing very young,
as a teenager, you know, professionally.

849
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:16,857
And as a comedian,
what you're supposed to do...

850
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:18,776
You're supposed to talk
about what you know.

851
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,778
And what I knew always was performing.

852
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:25,157
So to talk about...
[chuckles] traffic or laundry

853
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,742
felt incredibly disingenuous.

854
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:32,039
But I worried that making a show
about performing would be too meta.

855
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,375
It wouldn't be relatable to people
that aren't performers.

856
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,962
But what I found is that
I don't think anyone isn't.

857
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,506
Could we get the house lights up
for a second? And could you...

858
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,967
Let the lights on stage...
Let the artifice fade away.

859
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:46,012
-Now we're all the same.
-[scattered cheers]

860
00:46:46,095 --> 00:46:49,974

-[audience laughs]

861
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:54,353
You know, I look out at...
I look out at you and, um...

862
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,313
It's a very diverse crowd.

863
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:58,566
I mean, more European
than I would've hoped, but...

864
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,401
we'll get there.

865
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,904
If I look at the young people...

866
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,949
You know, and I feel like...
I was born in 1990

867
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:11,203
and I was sort of raised in America
when it was a cult of self-expression.

868
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,789
And I was just taught,
you know, express myself

869
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:17,168
and have things to say
and everyone will care about them.

870
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,502
And I think everyone was taught that

871
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:22,673
and most of us found out
no one gives a shit what we think.

872
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:25,092
So we flock to performers
by the thousands

873
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,303
'cause we're the few
that have found an audience.

874
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:29,680
And then I'm supposed to get up here
and say, "Follow your dreams,"

875
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:32,516
as if this is a meritocracy?
It is not, okay?

876
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,020
I had a privileged life
and I got lucky and I'm unhappy.

877
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,813
[audience laughing]

878
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,233
They say it's... it's like
the me generation. It's not.

879
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:42,318
It's not...

880
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,279
[stammers] The arrogance is taught
or it was cultivated.

881
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,783
It's... it's self-conscious.
That's what it is. It's the...

882
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,702
It's conscious of self...
[stammers] Social media...

883
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:56,040
it's just the market's answer
to a generation that demanded to perform.

884
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,043
So the market said,
"Here, perform everything

885
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,378
to each other all the time
for no reason."

886
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,130
It's prison, it's horrific.

887
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:06,008
It is performer and audience
melded together.

888
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:08,886
What do we want more than to lie
in our bed at the end of the day

889
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,722
and just watch our life
as a satisfied audience member?

890
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:15,559
I know very little about anything,
but what I do know is that

891
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,479
if you can live your life
without an audience...

892
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,984
you should do it.
And now you're thinking...

893
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:28,114
"How the fuck are you gonna dig the show
out of this weird hole?"

894
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,241
Oh, you want me to be funny
and make a point?

895
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,159
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

896
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,373
-Batman. So... how do we do it?

[cheering]

898
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,637
We do it like this.

899
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,349
I went to Kanye West's recent tour,
the Yeezus Tour.

900
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,726
It was a big, dramatic, theatrical show.

901
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,854
He did something very strange
at the end of his show

902
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,940
where he ranted...
for, like, 20 minutes.

903
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,400
It was kind of a rant,
kind of a song.

904
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:05,860
He had auto-tune on his voice

905
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,736
and there was an instrumental
in the background...

906
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,281
-[instrumental music playing]
-...like this instrumental.

907
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,659
He talked about his problems...

908
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,828
race...

909
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,581
power.

910
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,167
His $90 T-shirts
weren't selling very well.

911
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,961
That was most of it.
And I watched this.

912
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,006
I thought maybe I could do this.

913
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,300
I'll be honest, my problems

914
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:32,761
are not as high-stakes as Kanye's,
but I have problems.

915
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,223
And maybe a crowd in New York
would be nice enough to indulge me.

916
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:38,559
So as we get to the end
of a night of theater...

917
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,853
and comedy
and sweaters coming on and off,

918
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,688
I got one question for you...

919
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:48,235
