1
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:11,605
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL COMEDY SPECIAL

2
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:27,645
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

3
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:32,765
Keep on clapping.
It'd be a shame to stop here.

4
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:38,045
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:43,085
I'm very happy to be performing again
here in Milan.

6
00:00:43,165 --> 00:00:47,205
I love this city. I work here
and come here very often.

7
00:00:47,565 --> 00:00:51,325
I almost live here,
and I like it... always.

8
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:53,405
Even on days like this.

9
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:55,205
Milan.

10
00:00:56,445 --> 00:01:00,325
Guys, on days like this,
Milan shows off its best side.

11
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:01,685
Doesn't it?

12
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:04,125
Because the city seems like...

13
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:09,565
a postcard made by the hatred
of a Southern Italian.

14
00:01:11,645 --> 00:01:14,245
"We'll put the gray sky here.

15
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:16,845
Here we'll put that damn CityLife

16
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:19,525
that these bastards like so much.

17
00:01:19,605 --> 00:01:22,525
Mr. Fedez and Miss Ferragni go on top.

18
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:24,565
And here we'll put the cold,

19
00:01:24,645 --> 00:01:28,525
which gives these damn bastards the runs."

20
00:01:30,445 --> 00:01:34,205
When I left Rome this morning,
it was 20 degrees Celsius.

21
00:01:34,285 --> 00:01:37,445
With 20 degrees, you already start seeing

22
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:39,965
summer-like scenes
taking place around Rome.

23
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:43,845
The other day I saw Roman children
shooting parrots in Villa Ada.

24
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:50,365
People grilling nutrias
along the Tiber's riverbanks.

25
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:51,645
Just beautiful.

26
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,725
The news this week reported

27
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:58,685
that Rome has been awarded
a very important title.

28
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:05,365
It won the title of
"Capital of the Third World, 2018".

29
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,325
It makes me happy.

30
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:11,765
It's a great signal for the city.

31
00:02:11,845 --> 00:02:15,485
A good thing at last,
after many negative critiques.

32
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:19,125
If you've been to Rome recently,

33
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,965
you'll know that vegetation
is swallowing the monuments.

34
00:02:23,365 --> 00:02:25,685
It's like Angkor Wat in Cambodia.

35
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,725
Like the temples in Yucatán.

36
00:02:29,085 --> 00:02:31,765
It has that charming, luxurious decadence.

37
00:02:31,845 --> 00:02:35,405
The title is well-deserved,
because outside of Termini station,

38
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:37,725
you won't find any taxis.

39
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:39,805
You'll find auto rickshaws.

40
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,005
I took one the other day to get home.

41
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:46,765
I told the guy, 
"Could you take me to Piazza Sempione?"

42
00:03:09,165 --> 00:03:12,205
So I say, "Okay,
I'll take the underground then."

43
00:03:31,805 --> 00:03:34,605
"Well, then I'll get an Uber."

44
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,765
-"What? I'm gonna kill you!'
-"I'll take the auto rickshaw!"

45
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,925
Thank you. That's how things are in Rome.

46
00:03:46,525 --> 00:03:49,565
To any Romans living in Milan,
don't come back!

47
00:03:49,645 --> 00:03:52,925
No need to.
I'll let you know when the time's right.

48
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:55,285
I hope things in Rome will improve,

49
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:59,165
because I'm at a stage in my life
where I need stability.

50
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,445
Yes, because I am 30 years old,

51
00:04:02,765 --> 00:04:04,725
I'm about to turn 31.

52
00:04:05,765 --> 00:04:09,445
I'd appreciate some enthusiasm
from you at least, because...

53
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:10,405
Thank you.

54
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:15,725
Because I feel none.

55
00:04:15,805 --> 00:04:17,325
Zero enthusiasm.

56
00:04:17,405 --> 00:04:21,325
So far, things have been good,
but I don't know what's next.

57
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:24,405
Because up until last year,
when I was still 29,

58
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:27,405
every time an older person,

59
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:30,765
either my parents' friends
or older friends,

60
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:33,605
would ask my age, I would say 29,

61
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:36,365
and every single person
would reply like this:

62
00:04:36,765 --> 00:04:38,125
"Well, then...

63
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:41,765
you're almost there!"

64
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,165
With a slightly less labored voice

65
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,885
than the one I'd use to ask someone,

66
00:04:47,965 --> 00:04:49,525
"How old are you?"

67
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,045
"I am 94."

68
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:53,605
"Well, then...

69
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:57,845
you're almost there."

70
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,285
But the fact is that,

71
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,685
on the one hand, turning 30 is great,

72
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:05,365
because it's liberating.

73
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:09,165
There are many things now
I'm no longer ashamed to say.

74
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:12,485
I used to be, but now, for example,

75
00:05:12,805 --> 00:05:17,445
I'm no longer ashamed to say
that craft beers are shit.

76
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,925
Craft beers suck balls.

77
00:05:22,685 --> 00:05:27,125
I'm also annoyed by the attitude
of those who like them.

78
00:05:27,205 --> 00:05:28,885
You know, when they say,

79
00:05:28,965 --> 00:05:32,325
"I see that you only have Heineken...

80
00:05:32,605 --> 00:05:35,205
Ceres and Corona,
but I can't drink those,

81
00:05:35,285 --> 00:05:39,245
because if I do,
I become an even bigger dickhead.

82
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:40,925
And I can't..."

83
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:45,685
If there's one thing I've learned,

84
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,445
and it took me 30 years,

85
00:05:47,525 --> 00:05:52,325
is that in my life, I'm not touching
anything made by Trappist monks.

86
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:54,765
Nothing. Ever.

87
00:05:54,845 --> 00:05:56,485
Keep those monks away from me.

88
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,645
By the way, let me dare you.

89
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,485
Is there anyone here
who's seen a Trappist monk

90
00:06:02,565 --> 00:06:04,205
and is willing to swear it?

91
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:07,645
There are a few things
whose existence I refuse to accept.

92
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:09,085
Sirens,

93
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,005
unicorns,

94
00:06:11,685 --> 00:06:13,085
Trappist monks,

95
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:16,365
the online University Niccolò Cusano.

96
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:22,485
What was that?

97
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:23,805
The region Molise.

98
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:28,045
That's way more believable
than UniCusano though.

99
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:32,365
Are you feeling uneasy
because you're enrolled there?

100
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:36,405
There are people here
who dropped out of drama school.

101
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:40,565
I know it, so don't worry.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

102
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:45,165
If in the '80s you were a kid
who didn't know what to do,

103
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:46,525
you'd shoot up.

104
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:49,365
Quietly, without bothering anyone.

105
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:53,885
But today, if you're a kid
unsure about what to do with your life,

106
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:56,165
you open a beer shop.

107
00:06:56,685 --> 00:07:00,605
Not only that, 
you brew your own craft beer.

108
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:03,725
A beer shop just opened near my place.

109
00:07:03,805 --> 00:07:07,365
But I'm worried, because people
who start these businesses

110
00:07:07,445 --> 00:07:10,325
don't understand
that it's a saturated market.

111
00:07:10,405 --> 00:07:14,045
It's a phenomenon
seen in other businesses.

112
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,485
But nobody learns from their mistakes.

113
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:19,165
So I went to this beer shop,

114
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:22,165
I talked to the owner, tasted the beer,

115
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:24,685
and told him, "Your beer's pretty nice,

116
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:28,405
but why does it leave
a slight tobacco aftertaste?"

117
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:31,165
"Well, the tobacco aftertaste you feel

118
00:07:31,245 --> 00:07:33,965
is because this used to be an e-cig store.

119
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:36,965
And...

120
00:07:42,205 --> 00:07:46,365
When my partner and I moved in,
we found the old owner hanging there.

121
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,805
We left him there
because doing this is fun.

122
00:07:50,525 --> 00:07:51,565
Can you see that?

123
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,245
He's sort of become our mascot.

124
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:57,125
We called the place
'The Hanging Man's Brewery'.

125
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:02,725
The cigarettes were still on the shelves,
so we put them into the beer fermenters

126
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:06,485
and made this IPA with tobacco aftertaste

127
00:08:06,565 --> 00:08:08,405
and called it 'Vape-IPA'."

128
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,845
But the real question is,

129
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:17,765
when the market becomes really saturated
with microbreweries, artisan burger bars,

130
00:08:17,845 --> 00:08:19,405
and artisan perfume shops,

131
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,485
what will the next thing be?

132
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:25,445
Is there anyone here
who majored in economics?

133
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,525
Don't feel ashamed.

134
00:08:28,605 --> 00:08:31,725
You two in the front row?
And what's your name?

135
00:08:32,085 --> 00:08:33,725
Michele? Great.

136
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:34,805
Here's my tip.

137
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:40,525
The next frontier for artisan products
after perfume shops and breweries

138
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:43,285
will be artisan gasoline.

139
00:08:44,205 --> 00:08:45,645
Do you believe me, Michele?

140
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,565
You open an artisan gas station

141
00:08:48,645 --> 00:08:51,925
in a neighborhood like... Isola.

142
00:08:52,005 --> 00:08:54,525
I think people there
would fall for it, right?

143
00:08:54,605 --> 00:08:57,925
It's the right neighborhood
for an artisan gas station.

144
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:08,085
This is extremely important, Michele.

145
00:09:08,165 --> 00:09:11,005
Because it's all about the name.

146
00:09:11,085 --> 00:09:13,045
You have to name it "orgasoline."

147
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,525
Which is for real.

148
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:17,525
You name it "orgasoline"

149
00:09:17,925 --> 00:09:21,445
and welcome your customers like this.

150
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:24,565
As the cars drive in, you go like this:
"Ciao!"

151
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,845
Roman-style customer service.

152
00:09:27,285 --> 00:09:29,645
The nuts and bolts are: "Ciao!

153
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,925
What can I get you?"

154
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,485
"Ten euros of unleaded gas, please."

155
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:38,125
"So in terms of unleaded fuel,

156
00:09:38,205 --> 00:09:42,805
this week, at pump number four,
we have this one called 'Desert Dune'.

157
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:46,645
It's a very light unleaded, 16 octanes.

158
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,885
The hydrocarbons are a bit alkaloid.

159
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,645
If you want something else,
here's a super-duper diesel fuel.

160
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:57,245
It will blow up your car,
but I still recommend it.

161
00:09:57,325 --> 00:10:00,645
This is a great diesel,
called 'Sheikh's Delight'.

162
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,085
It's extracted by hand,

163
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,565
produced by Trappist Sheikhs
in the Persian Gulf."

164
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:14,925
Just an idea, Michele.
Feel free to do as you please.

165
00:10:15,805 --> 00:10:21,845
And yet, despite all that,
I do have one regret now that I'm 30.

166
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:25,605
It's that compulsory military service
was abolished.

167
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:28,085
I regret not serving in the military,

168
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:32,005
because I won't be able to tell
those typical stories.

169
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:37,125
I'll never be able to say
that I served in some exotic place like,

170
00:10:37,405 --> 00:10:39,485
I don't know, Ascoli Piceno.

171
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,685
I'll never be able to say,

172
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:46,645
"We drank a strong cordial once
that made our bowels twist."

173
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:48,925
I'll never have those kinds of stories.

174
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:53,965
And I feel sorry, because I often wonder
what I'll tell my grandchild

175
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,125
when I'm old.

176
00:10:55,205 --> 00:11:00,285
I remember how my grandfather
used to tell me these incredible stories.

177
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:02,885
I mean, Rome was being bombed.

178
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:04,325
They had curfews,

179
00:11:04,405 --> 00:11:07,205
hung black cloths over windows,
there were sirens.

180
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:12,325
He once told me that the most incredible
memory from his youth

181
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:16,085
was an American soldier
giving him some chocolate to try.

182
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:20,565
I told him, "Grandpa,
go tell Pupi Avati right away.

183
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,445
He'll make 28 movies about it.

184
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:25,605
Don't waste your time
on this 11-year-old moron.

185
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,885
Go to him now."

186
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:33,205
I think that our generation
is not very heroic.

187
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:36,845
What will I tell my grandson
when I'm a grandfather?

188
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:41,965
If I had to tell him
the most incredible memory of my youth,

189
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,445
it'd be pretty awkward.

190
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:48,565
Because I'd have to tell him
the following true story.

191
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:51,365
"Come here, kid.

192
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,365
Come here to Grandpa.

193
00:11:53,565 --> 00:11:58,365
Grandpa is going to tell you
the most incredible memory

194
00:11:58,445 --> 00:12:00,325
of his youth.

195
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:02,165
Are you ready? Here we go.

196
00:12:03,085 --> 00:12:05,045
The summer after high school graduation,

197
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,485
Grandpa went to Ibiza with four buddies.

198
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:14,765
Well, you need to know
that Ibiza was a Balearic island.

199
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:19,045
We had the European Union then,
not the Chinese Union

200
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,285
which abolished
the free movement of people.

201
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,765
Back then,
you could get on a low-cost flight,

202
00:12:23,845 --> 00:12:27,565
and for only 100 euros,
the equivalent of 3,000 yuan today,

203
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:31,405
you could fly to the Balearic Islands,

204
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:34,245
you could go to Germany,
or to Brexit Island,

205
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,965
which is still being bombed today.

206
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:42,085
And one night,
Grandpa and his buddies went to Amnesia,

207
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:43,885
which is a club in Ibiza.

208
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:47,325
There was a party called "Manumission".
<i>Mamma mia!</i>

209
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:50,845
So many Italians at Manumission!

210
00:12:51,565 --> 00:12:55,085
Grandpa sees this dancer
in the back of the room.

211
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:59,565
This beautiful dancer
who was dancing and dancing,

212
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,685
and then, in her dance, she starts...

213
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,645
fiddling with her pussy.

214
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,725
She fiddles and fiddles,

215
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:12,725
and pull outs a little Brazilian flag.

216
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,645
She keeps on fiddling

217
00:13:15,725 --> 00:13:19,725
and pulls out a French,
a Canadian, and a Mexican flag.

218
00:13:20,725 --> 00:13:22,165
And Grandpa swears

219
00:13:22,245 --> 00:13:26,405
that<i></i>Amnesia was more dumbstruck
than Santeria is right now.

220
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,925
Now they clap, but they were uneasy.

221
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,925
She hands the thread over to a colleague,

222
00:13:40,005 --> 00:13:43,365
then walks to the other side of the room,

223
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:46,045
and from her pussy came out

224
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:51,325
258 flags from all the countries
in the world.

225
00:13:51,965 --> 00:13:55,285
And this one is the most enduring memory

226
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:58,645
of your grandfather's youth.

227
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,045
Do you want to hear something even better?

228
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:05,285
That dancer became your grandmother."

229
00:14:11,325 --> 00:14:14,885
For as long as we live
in the European Union,

230
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:16,565
I love traveling.

231
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:20,445
I really love it
and travel as often as I can.

232
00:14:20,765 --> 00:14:23,805
A few years ago,
I had a great trip with my girlfriend

233
00:14:23,885 --> 00:14:25,805
when we visited Vietnam.

234
00:14:25,885 --> 00:14:28,365
A truly wonderful country.

235
00:14:28,765 --> 00:14:32,805
I really want to point out
that it was a few years prior

236
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:36,205
to the <i>Pechino Express</i> season
filmed in Vietnam.

237
00:14:36,285 --> 00:14:38,005
I really want to say that,

238
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,485
because after that,
the country became mainstream.

239
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:45,125
Some friends of mine
who went there recently

240
00:14:45,205 --> 00:14:48,765
told me that
the best-selling souvenir in Hanoi

241
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:52,205
is a fridge magnet
with Costantino della Gherardesca

242
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:54,125
vomiting noodles.

243
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,605
This is the most typical souvenir
in Hanoi right now.

244
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:02,605
We went before that. I recommend it
because Hanoi is beautiful.

245
00:15:02,685 --> 00:15:04,165
It's a very French city.

246
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:07,725
With palm trees and boulevards,
the Grand Opera House...

247
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:11,205
It's stunning.
They deep-fry everything in Hanoi.

248
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,685
Really. You go to these stalls,

249
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:15,965
and they'll deep-fry your veggies,

250
00:15:16,045 --> 00:15:18,045
they'll deep-fry your meat.

251
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,125
They can deep-fry your keys,

252
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:23,685
your passport, and your Imodium too,

253
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:24,805
so you're ready.

254
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:27,205
It's a wonderful place.

255
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:29,245
Highly recommended.

256
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:32,045
After a few lovely days in Hanoi,

257
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,645
we decide to visit Sapa.

258
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,525
A small town in the Tonkinese Alps,

259
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,925
about 180 kilometers from Hanoi.

260
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:41,845
Why do we go there?

261
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:45,365
Because in the travel guide we have,

262
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,005
it is described
with the exact following words.

263
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,925
"Imagine a mountain lodge

264
00:15:52,405 --> 00:15:55,405
nestled among the rice terraces.

265
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,645
Then imagine the Hmong,

266
00:15:57,725 --> 00:16:02,205
one of the friendliest ethnic groups
in the world, and their delicious cuisine.

267
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:04,605
Add a little Tolkienesque feel...

268
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,125
Welcome to Sapa."

269
00:16:09,285 --> 00:16:11,925
If you read something like this,

270
00:16:12,325 --> 00:16:15,085
you think the Tolkienesque bit
is bullshit.

271
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:18,205
It was written by someone
who's never been to Sapa

272
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:22,005
but who had a Tolkien book on his desk
and wrote down something.

273
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:24,005
But we decide to go there.

274
00:16:24,085 --> 00:16:26,485
When traveling around these countries,

275
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,805
you need to take night trains.

276
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:32,445
A night lasts
for a reasonable number of hours,

277
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,885
eight or nine hours.

278
00:16:34,165 --> 00:16:38,285
But on these fucking night trains
in Third World countries,

279
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,765
one night lasts 57 hours!

280
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,845
It's 57 hours of darkness,

281
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:46,085
sleeping on a hard-berth.

282
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:49,685
Which means you sleep
on an asbestos slab this thick

283
00:16:49,765 --> 00:16:54,165
and with the air conditioning vent
this close to your face.

284
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:58,085
My girlfriend has this gift
of being able to fall asleep anywhere.

285
00:16:58,165 --> 00:16:59,605
While after, I swear,

286
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,845
after 28 minutes
with the air conditioner in my face,

287
00:17:02,925 --> 00:17:06,005
I say, "Why the fuck
aren't I in Santa Marinella,

288
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:07,805
like all normal people?

289
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,445
Why am I doing
this damn 30-year-old guy's trip?

290
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:12,365
Why?"

291
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:22,325
To avoid waking up looking like
Jack Nicholson at the end of <i>The Shining,</i>

292
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:25,445
I decide to take a walk in the train car.

293
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:26,725
So I get off the berth,

294
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:31,445
and I bump into a very typical character
you meet on these trips.

295
00:17:31,525 --> 00:17:33,965
The American who's been everywhere.

296
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:38,605
He's been to every single place on Earth
and makes you feel like shit,

297
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:43,045
because he's been to places
you'll never ever be able to see.

298
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,405
We get to talk and I ask,
"How long have you been traveling?"

299
00:18:14,445 --> 00:18:17,405
Holy fucking shit, Jeff!

300
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:33,845
The next morning,

301
00:19:34,325 --> 00:19:36,205
fifty-seven hours later,

302
00:19:37,165 --> 00:19:38,365
we arrive at Sapa.

303
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:43,605
Or rather at the Vietnamese equivalent
of Orbetello Scalo,

304
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,765
if you know what I mean.

305
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:48,965
We arrive, then get off,

306
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:51,685
and there stands Sapa.

307
00:19:52,365 --> 00:19:54,805
Imagine a mountain lodge

308
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:57,605
nestled among the Tonkinese Alps.

309
00:19:58,085 --> 00:20:02,285
I swear that Sapa
is the closest place to Quarto Oggiaro

310
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:04,245
I've ever been to in my life.

311
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:08,085
It's like Ho Chi Minh,
the evil Vietnamese dictator,

312
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:12,285
had sent one of his city planners
to Quarto Oggiaro in the '60s

313
00:20:12,365 --> 00:20:15,325
and built its replica
in the Tonkinese Alps.

314
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:19,805
And what to say about the Hmong people?

315
00:20:20,005 --> 00:20:24,365
This lovely ethnic minority group
and their delicious cuisine.

316
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,325
The spirit of the ethnic minority
is long gone.

317
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,325
They're greedy sellers.

318
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:33,245
As soon as we get off the bus,
they try to sell us their souvenirs.

319
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:44,805
The only way to get rid of them
is to buy these sharp canes

320
00:20:45,085 --> 00:20:48,085
that they sell themselves
in order to kick them away.

321
00:20:48,165 --> 00:20:49,165
And we leave.

322
00:20:58,085 --> 00:20:59,245
At mid-morning,

323
00:21:00,045 --> 00:21:01,845
something happens.

324
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,285
Something very common
when traveling in Asia.

325
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:08,125
Perhaps one of the best things
you can experience here.

326
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:09,925
A memory shared by so many.

327
00:21:10,445 --> 00:21:13,485
At some point, you totally freeze.

328
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:18,565
Your forehead is beaded with cold sweat.

329
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:24,285
You start feeling a kind of movement.

330
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,725
I call it the "folding-fan diarrhea".

331
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,565
What's "folding-fan diarrhea"?

332
00:21:34,645 --> 00:21:37,325
The Lonely Planet
would describe it like this:

333
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:41,565
"Imagine riding a donkey
in the Tonkinese Alps,

334
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:46,005
when suddenly, your forehead
gets beaded with sweat.

335
00:21:46,445 --> 00:21:48,925
From the pituitary gland,
you start sensing

336
00:21:49,165 --> 00:21:51,925
an evil feeling spreading

337
00:21:52,205 --> 00:21:53,605
to your bowels.

338
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:59,045
The people around you start melting
like in a Francis Bacon painting.

339
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:02,125
Brace yourselves!
It's happening to you too!"

340
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:04,645
But personally,

341
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:08,085
I prefer to describe it with these words.

342
00:22:08,885 --> 00:22:10,885
Basically, what happens is that

343
00:22:11,285 --> 00:22:12,645
you sit on the john,

344
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:14,645
and hear this.

345
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:20,525
You stand up,

346
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,605
and it's as if a great magician

347
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:24,765
had swiftly opened a deck of cards.

348
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:28,725
That's it.

349
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:42,165
Funny that I stay up nights to write jokes

350
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:45,245
and it's the "folding-fan shits"
that gets the most laughs.

351
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:46,725
Milan...

352
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:52,325
The trip ends.

353
00:22:52,845 --> 00:22:53,805
All goes well.

354
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:56,725
Vietnam is beautiful.
You should go check it out.

355
00:22:57,725 --> 00:23:02,365
But the most scared I've been
while traveling

356
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:07,005
has been at the end
of a relaxing weekend in Vienna.

357
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,725
Two days of pure
Austro-Hungarian efficiency

358
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:11,965
ruined by this.

359
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:15,725
I realized the danger
when I was at the gate

360
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:17,285
on the way back to Italy.

361
00:23:17,365 --> 00:23:20,125
That's a very emblematic part of the trip.

362
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:22,365
Because it feels like...

363
00:23:22,445 --> 00:23:25,645
like some pieces of Italy
that you had removed,

364
00:23:25,725 --> 00:23:28,045
no matter how far you've traveled,

365
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:31,285
violently resurface
right there in front of you.

366
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:33,645
Like a landing before landing.

367
00:23:33,725 --> 00:23:35,365
I'm talking about...

368
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:38,805
the couple from Caserta
with fuchsia Hogans.

369
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:39,885
There they are.

370
00:23:39,965 --> 00:23:43,405
The family from North Rome.
Dad, mom, three blonde daughters,

371
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:45,685
all wearing Abercrombie & Fitch.

372
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:46,685
There they are.

373
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:50,325
The entrepreneur from Brianza
with his Cuban wife.

374
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:53,685
He's signing her expulsion order
because she's only 15.

375
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,805
There they are.

376
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:56,565
Right there in front of you.

377
00:23:57,725 --> 00:23:59,845
We arrive at Vienna airport.

378
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:02,765
It was the last flight of the day.
At 9:00 p.m.

379
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:04,645
And two stewardesses,

380
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:07,845
who looked like characters
from a Brothers Grimm's tale,

381
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:09,845
two young Austrian girls,

382
00:24:09,925 --> 00:24:13,205
tell us the following
with enviable candor.

383
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:17,645
"Ladies and gentlemen, we're sorry,
but your flight was canceled."

384
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:21,125
I swear, it only took a second.

385
00:24:21,205 --> 00:24:24,325
"At my signal, unleash hell."

386
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:28,685
I think the Battle of Valle Giulia in 1968

387
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,445
was less violent.

388
00:24:30,525 --> 00:24:31,765
In no time,

389
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:35,045
the Caserta fringe jumps up and says,

390
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,645
"We've got to stick and fight together

391
00:24:37,725 --> 00:24:41,045
to show these fucking Austrians
that we're Italians!"

392
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,285
I heard it with my ears.

393
00:24:49,165 --> 00:24:52,685
You may have seen these tracksuit pants

394
00:24:52,765 --> 00:24:54,205
with a crotch this low.

395
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:56,045
Not everyone can wear them.

396
00:24:56,125 --> 00:24:59,365
There were two Roman guys
both wearing these pants,

397
00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:00,685
and they say this,

398
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:03,365
"Seen these bastards?

399
00:25:04,645 --> 00:25:07,525
They send a girl to tell us,

400
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,005
instead of a dude."

401
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:21,885
What would you have done
had it been a dude?

402
00:25:24,285 --> 00:25:29,005
When I hear someone say
such abominable things,

403
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:31,365
I can't help thinking,

404
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:33,445
"His parents were cousins."

405
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:38,485
Two cousins who fucked
at a Christmas party.

406
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:42,765
I was there.

407
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:44,565
Sitting.

408
00:25:45,165 --> 00:25:46,565
Enjoying this performance.

409
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,285
The Casertans with spears,

410
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:50,245
the others in full armor.

411
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:54,565
And while I enjoy
this compelling performance,

412
00:25:54,965 --> 00:25:55,965
next to me...

413
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:58,765
Pasolini's ghost appears...

414
00:26:00,845 --> 00:26:01,885
and recites,

415
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:04,925
"When today,

416
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:07,445
this morning,

417
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,365
at the airport in Vienna,

418
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:14,325
you brawled with the stewardesses,

419
00:26:15,285 --> 00:26:18,765
I stood with the Austrian stewardesses.

420
00:26:19,325 --> 00:26:23,325
For they are the true daughters
of the working class.

421
00:26:24,565 --> 00:26:28,245
Nevertheless... fuck you, Vueling!"

422
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:44,965
I like to think that artists too
had their problems.

423
00:26:45,045 --> 00:26:48,325
Nowadays, people tend to idealize art.

424
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:49,605
You know?

425
00:26:49,685 --> 00:26:53,325
You hear things like,
"All television sucks."

426
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,045
"Movies are only made for money."

427
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,525
"Only bakers from Brescia sell books."

428
00:27:00,045 --> 00:27:01,565
Stuff like this.

429
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:04,365
The same people who say this,

430
00:27:04,805 --> 00:27:07,845
also say, "Things used to be different.

431
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,885
Art was made for art's sake.

432
00:27:11,245 --> 00:27:13,405
Artists weren't just after money.

433
00:27:13,485 --> 00:27:16,285
Back then, art used to be authentic."

434
00:27:16,725 --> 00:27:17,725
The problem is,

435
00:27:17,965 --> 00:27:19,885
who said that to us?

436
00:27:19,965 --> 00:27:23,125
How do we know
that in any time in history...

437
00:27:23,205 --> 00:27:28,245
Even when people were doing
rather noncommercial things.

438
00:27:28,325 --> 00:27:31,645
For example,
early 20th century Italian poetry.

439
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:35,125
How do we know that back then,
somewhere,

440
00:27:35,205 --> 00:27:38,925
two envious producers
weren't talking like this.

441
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:45,645
"Have you seen what Ungaretti's doing?

442
00:27:45,725 --> 00:27:48,765
Thanks to Hermeticism,
Ungaretti hit the big time.

443
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:52,485
Hermeticism is paying for his properties!

444
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:55,405
I didn't want to say this,
but the war did him good.

445
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:58,245
The bombs did him good.

446
00:27:58,325 --> 00:28:00,845
May I say something?

447
00:28:01,205 --> 00:28:04,245
'M'illumino d'immenso,' and that's it.

448
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,925
The message is clear enough.

449
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:09,285
Let's not waste time talking.

450
00:28:09,365 --> 00:28:12,125
You put that on iPhone covers,

451
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:15,085
on t-shirts for teenage girls.

452
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:16,405
Let me tell you this.

453
00:28:16,485 --> 00:28:21,525
I've been saying this for years
and no one ever gave me credit.

454
00:28:21,605 --> 00:28:25,205
Michele, we're friends now,
so let me tell you this.

455
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:26,525
Do you know Dalí?

456
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:28,645
Salvador. A friend of mine.

457
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,045
A nutcase. Total nutcase.

458
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,605
But the biggest genius
I've ever worked with.

459
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:36,165
In 1934, Salvador Dalí comes to me

460
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:39,125
with this idea for a painting,
<i>The Persistence of Memory.</i>

461
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:40,445
You know it?

462
00:28:40,525 --> 00:28:42,565
He shows it to me and I say,

463
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:45,125
'Can I tell you something? It's beautiful.

464
00:28:45,885 --> 00:28:48,205
Beautiful colors, beautiful landscapes,

465
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:49,805
beautiful frame.

466
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:52,285
Can I pitch you something?

467
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:53,325
Melt the clocks.

468
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,525
I said, melt them.'

469
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:09,805
And he goes, 'I'm not sure.
What does it mean then?'

470
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:14,405
I say, 'What do you mean?
We make surrealism, Salvador.

471
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:18,365
It can mean transience of life,
war coming, passing of time,

472
00:29:18,445 --> 00:29:21,405
but basically,
people shouldn't understand shit!

473
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:22,885
That's surrealism.

474
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:25,485
Look at what others are doing.

475
00:29:25,565 --> 00:29:27,805
Do you know what Magritte
was doing for a job?

476
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:29,365
He used to paint wallpaper,

477
00:29:29,445 --> 00:29:32,165
now he draws apples on faces
and can afford Cayenne tobacco.

478
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:34,325
Let's learn the lesson. Shall we?'

479
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:37,805
Come on.

480
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:42,765
He never gave me credit.

481
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:47,365
Everyone knows the genius,
but I know the Dalí tight-ass...

482
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,365
I was the first, I made them all.

483
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:51,405
Euripides and I wrote together <i>Medea.</i>

484
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,765
About the ending...

485
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,765
Euripides was telling me,

486
00:29:54,845 --> 00:29:56,565
'You know what?

487
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:58,685
I'd like her to eat in the end.

488
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:02,325
What shall we have Medea eat?'

489
00:30:02,405 --> 00:30:04,685
I tell him, 'Listen Euripides.

490
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:07,125
You want her to eat
gyros pita with tzatziki?

491
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:09,765
Have her eat her children!

492
00:30:09,845 --> 00:30:10,765
Trust me!'

493
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,805
He goes, 'I'm not so sure.'

494
00:30:12,885 --> 00:30:16,365
And I say,
'Sorry, Euripides. I don't get it.

495
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:20,205
That's all you Greeks have.
Let's finally legitimize the incest taboo.

496
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:24,325
The Greek tragedy
as catharsis of the subconscious.

497
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,965
There aren't therapists
for another 2,000 years.

498
00:30:27,045 --> 00:30:28,685
Take a seat and wait.'

499
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:32,045
And he says, 'Yeah, but...

500
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:35,405
I don't know if people will accept it.'

501
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:39,085
'Because Socrates buggering kids is fine?
I don't get you!

502
00:30:39,765 --> 00:30:40,765
I really don't!'"

503
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:46,725
Thank you for your response.
Give yourself a round of applause.

504
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:56,405
You're a very educated audience.

505
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,445
I'll tell you more.

506
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:02,285
You're clearly recognizable
as <i>Internazionale </i>readers.

507
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:07,445
Guilty as charged, huh?

508
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:11,765
How many in here read <i>Internazionale?</i>

509
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,765
How many only read it
for Brezsny's horoscope?

510
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:21,205
You do, huh? I know.

511
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:23,125
But you're not alone.

512
00:31:23,205 --> 00:31:26,645
Many people read it like a manga.

513
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:30,125
They start from the last page.

514
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,245
May I ask your name?

515
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:35,445
Silvia. So, Silvia,

516
00:31:35,525 --> 00:31:37,925
why do you read Brezsny's horoscope?

517
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:39,965
What makes it better
than other horoscopes?

518
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,285
It's more creative.

519
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:45,165
Okay.

520
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:48,445
I'll ask you one question, Silvia.

521
00:31:48,525 --> 00:31:50,845
Answer it very frankly.

522
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:53,765
Have you ever seen...

523
00:31:54,285 --> 00:31:55,405
Rob Brezsny...

524
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,645
and Paolo Fox together?

525
00:32:10,325 --> 00:32:12,725
What does it suggest?

526
00:32:13,325 --> 00:32:16,925
That Paolo Fox and Rob Brezsny
are the same person.

527
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:20,165
Every horoscope is the same lie.

528
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:23,005
One is sold to housewives
watching Magalli.

529
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:26,445
The other to girls majoring
in International Relations.

530
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:27,685
Like you, right?

531
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:29,925
No? That's not your field.

532
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:33,125
Basically,  you need to think
of a horoscope

533
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:36,125
as a huge food corporation

534
00:32:36,285 --> 00:32:38,125
with multiple production lines.

535
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:42,925
"The extra dark chocolate cookies,
4K, full HD,

536
00:32:43,005 --> 00:32:45,485
go on the top shelf in Carrefour

537
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:47,725
for 4.99 euro.

538
00:32:47,805 --> 00:32:49,805
While these cookies here,

539
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,165
made of scalp and palm oil,

540
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:56,325
get kicked to the bottom shelf
in the discounter."

541
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,405
"Excuse me, but I saw them
come out of the same oven."

542
00:33:00,485 --> 00:33:06,365
"You're from Altroconsumo?"

543
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:16,845
Silvia, next time you read--

544
00:33:16,925 --> 00:33:18,125
What's your sign?

545
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:19,445
Taurus.

546
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:23,205
Next time you read
your horoscope by Breszny,

547
00:33:23,285 --> 00:33:25,645
read it with Paolo Fox's voice.

548
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:28,205
It'll open up a new world.

549
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:32,965
Taurus.

550
00:33:34,765 --> 00:33:36,845
"In 1969,

551
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:41,325
Bob Dylan writes <i>Blowin' in the Wind.</i>

552
00:33:43,005 --> 00:33:43,925
Perhaps,

553
00:33:44,845 --> 00:33:46,365
for you as well as for Bob Dylan,

554
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:49,085
that dove will spread its wings
in the sky."

555
00:33:52,645 --> 00:33:57,005
He makes long pauses when reading it
so that his lies sound more valuable.

556
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:00,285
I, too, read <i>Internazionale,</i>

557
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:02,445
but not as often as I used to.

558
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:04,685
Because something happened.

559
00:34:04,765 --> 00:34:06,725
One day, while I was reading it,

560
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,605
one article caught my eye.

561
00:34:11,645 --> 00:34:12,725
"Mongolia.

562
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,565
New troubles for Xing Ying Mang,

563
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,965
Deputy Mayor of Ulaanbaatar.

564
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,005
Who allegedly used regional funds

565
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:26,285
to purchase four handfuls of rice.

566
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,245
An investigation is still underway."

567
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,365
That made me...

568
00:34:32,605 --> 00:34:33,925
start wondering

569
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,485
when this kind of news
could ever be useful.

570
00:34:38,885 --> 00:34:39,965
At a dinner party?

571
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,685
I don't know. I'm asking.

572
00:34:42,645 --> 00:34:44,445
"Hear about Xing Yang Ming?"

573
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,845
The shit will hit the fan.

574
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,605
It'll all come tumbling down.

575
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:00,885
The truth is that I read <i>Internazionale</i>

576
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:04,845
because many friends of mine
majored in political science.

577
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:08,165
If one of your friends
majored in political science,

578
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:10,365
it's hard to tell what his job is.

579
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:13,525
Unless you, too,
majored in political science.

580
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:15,565
Sometimes I see them.

581
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:20,725
People who majored in political science
spend a lot of time away.

582
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:22,285
Your friend is back...

583
00:35:22,925 --> 00:35:23,765
And...

584
00:35:24,605 --> 00:35:26,325
"Hi."

585
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,965
For some reason, they are always pensive.

586
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:32,365
You say, "Hey! How are you doing?

587
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:35,045
Where have you been for nine months?"

588
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:38,525
"Yeah, I spent nine months
in Burkina Faso.

589
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:40,245
And..."

590
00:35:40,325 --> 00:35:41,845
I say, "Well...

591
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:43,725
you put on some weight.

592
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:47,285
That doesn't feel right,
while being in Burkina Faso.

593
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:50,125
What were you doing there?"

594
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:53,045
"Well, basically, I was...

595
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:55,685
working with an NGO,

596
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:57,565
which took money from an NPO,

597
00:35:57,645 --> 00:36:01,645
then gave it to a refugee camp,
which gave it to another NPO,

598
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:06,245
financed by an NGO,
financed by another NPO,

599
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:08,365
with unhooding to the right,

600
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,965
like Antani from Tarapia Tapioco."

601
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:17,125
"But can you name one actual thing
you did in Burkina Faso?"

602
00:36:17,845 --> 00:36:20,765
"One night I got laid
by a woman I met on Tinder!"

603
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:25,565
It happens.

604
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,805
We're living in exciting times.

605
00:36:30,885 --> 00:36:33,885
A time which makes it possible

606
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:37,405
to get laid in Burkina Faso
thanks to an app.

607
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:40,925
But what's the cost
of this type of technology?

608
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,405
It's pretty simple.

609
00:36:43,605 --> 00:36:44,925
Our personal data.

610
00:36:45,005 --> 00:36:47,925
Big corporations use our personal data

611
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:51,445
to trade it among themselves
and use us like commodities.

612
00:36:52,005 --> 00:36:54,925
The first time I heard about privacy,

613
00:36:55,005 --> 00:36:56,085
like we do today,

614
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:58,045
I was in high school.

615
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,205
We're talking about 15 years ago.

616
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,005
And I heard it from Stefano Rodotà,

617
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:06,325
who wasn't just a random guy.

618
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:10,085
He was the president
of the Personal Data Protection Authority.

619
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:13,885
Or, as he was referred to
by the kids in my school,

620
00:37:14,325 --> 00:37:16,045
"The Privacy Boss."

621
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:22,165
"The Privacy Boss will give a talk today."

622
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:28,445
I like how at these school events,

623
00:37:28,525 --> 00:37:32,045
regardless of who the speaker was,

624
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:34,445
the response was always the same.

625
00:37:34,525 --> 00:37:36,165
Always this same attitude.

626
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:39,885
"Today, during the last two class periods,

627
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,405
Ronald McDonald is giving a talk."

628
00:37:43,605 --> 00:37:47,565
"Wasn't he a fictional character?"

629
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:49,605
"See? That's what I thought too!"

630
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:52,645
"But they say he's real.

631
00:37:52,845 --> 00:37:55,645
They sent bodyguards to pick him up.

632
00:37:56,045 --> 00:38:00,485
So, basically, physics class
in the last two periods is canceled."

633
00:38:02,605 --> 00:38:03,445
"All right.

634
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:04,645
I'm game.

635
00:38:05,045 --> 00:38:05,925
That's fine.

636
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:09,205
Now let's go smoke a fat bowl."

637
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:14,085
Stefano Rodotà walks
into my school's auditorium,

638
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:16,925
welcomed by an audience
of super stoned students.

639
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,685
They were so stoned. "Give him my soul!"

640
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,925
What epic memories!

641
00:38:22,005 --> 00:38:25,205
Incredible. Give it up for my high school.

642
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:33,245
Stefano Rodotà walks into a room
full of super stoned students.

643
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:38,605
He was invited to my school
by a group of Italian teachers.

644
00:38:38,685 --> 00:38:42,805
My teacher introduces him
with a shine in her eyes

645
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:47,245
only comparable to that
of a Lucca Comics organizer

646
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,925
introducing Zerocalcare.

647
00:38:49,005 --> 00:38:50,805
"Well, Stefano...

648
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:55,565
Stefano, we're super thrilled
to have you here with us.

649
00:38:55,645 --> 00:38:58,965
I'm so excited. I really can't believe it.

650
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,525
I'm just gonna jill-off a sec.
I'll be right back."

651
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:12,965
Stefano Rodotà takes a deep breath

652
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:15,365
and launches into a droning speech!

653
00:39:15,965 --> 00:39:17,925
A droning speech on data protection.

654
00:39:18,005 --> 00:39:20,965
But it is data protection 2002-style!

655
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:23,525
Old-school data protection.

656
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:30,085
"If I decide to purchase an airline ticket

657
00:39:30,165 --> 00:39:33,445
using my credit card,

658
00:39:34,085 --> 00:39:38,365
the moment I purchase the ticket,

659
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:43,565
both the airline and the bank will know--"

660
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:45,445
For fuck's sake, Stefano!

661
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:52,885
It doesn't matter, Stefano.

662
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:54,925
It doesn't matter.

663
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,045
You can drink a beer,

664
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:01,525
or do whatever you want
with the credit card dudes.

665
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:05,925
After this long-winded talk,

666
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:09,045
Stefano Rodotà closed this snoozefest

667
00:40:09,645 --> 00:40:10,645
with these words.

668
00:40:10,965 --> 00:40:15,205
"If we keep going down this road,

669
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:21,445
in ten years' time
we'll have an internet website

670
00:40:22,165 --> 00:40:25,245
where we'll post our photos,

671
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:30,205
we'll name the music bands we like,

672
00:40:31,205 --> 00:40:36,285
and perhaps we'll upload pictures
of our girlfriend on the beach."

673
00:40:40,045 --> 00:40:42,165
In that very moment,

674
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:46,925
Stefano Rodotà had invented Facebook,

675
00:40:48,805 --> 00:40:51,165
while a young Mark Zuckerberg,

676
00:40:51,245 --> 00:40:53,205
in his little Harvard dorm room,

677
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,205
was busy with a two-finger wank,

678
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:58,405
still using a 56k modem.

679
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:10,605
If that speech took place today,

680
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:13,205
its take on Facebook would be different.

681
00:41:13,285 --> 00:41:15,165
Call me a romantic,

682
00:41:15,245 --> 00:41:19,085
but I still think it's a wonderful tool.

683
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:24,085
A tool that allows you
to enter into people's lives

684
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:26,765
in a way that was unthinkable.

685
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:29,645
For example, I'm currently studying

686
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:31,965
old folks on Facebook.

687
00:41:32,565 --> 00:41:36,365
Because it's becoming "a thing".

688
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:37,565
But listen...

689
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,725
I suggest you try this thing.

690
00:41:40,085 --> 00:41:41,085
Go home,

691
00:41:41,645 --> 00:41:44,085
take the oldest friend you have,

692
00:41:44,765 --> 00:41:47,045
and look for his old friends.

693
00:41:47,565 --> 00:41:50,485
I swear, you'll need to buckle up,

694
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:53,565
because the deep web in Italy

695
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:55,565
isn't sites like Silk Road,

696
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:58,005
it's the seniors on Facebook.

697
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:02,365
How do you tell
a senior's profile on Facebook?

698
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:06,205
First, his profile picture
isn't a real profile picture.

699
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:08,565
His profile picture is a picture

700
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:12,125
taken with his phone
of a picture on his bed table.

701
00:42:14,125 --> 00:42:18,245
Often, there's a flash reflection.
It's a bit like this.

702
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:24,845
Second, below the profile picture
there's always a comment,

703
00:42:24,925 --> 00:42:27,205
usually by a Locrisuogolo Salvatore,

704
00:42:29,325 --> 00:42:31,165
who uses these words,

705
00:42:32,005 --> 00:42:34,205
"Heavens to Betsy! You look old."

706
00:42:34,765 --> 00:42:37,205
This comment is always there.

707
00:42:38,805 --> 00:42:41,365
Here's another typical thing seniors post.

708
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:46,365
It's a random Thursday afternoon.

709
00:42:47,165 --> 00:42:49,485
Locafierolo

710
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:51,805
Pasqualina

711
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:53,925
shares this picture.

712
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:57,885
A really badly pixelated flower bouquet,

713
00:42:58,805 --> 00:43:02,005
resolution 3:2,

714
00:43:04,885 --> 00:43:07,045
with this phrase below it,

715
00:43:07,725 --> 00:43:10,925
"Happy Thursday afternoon to you all."

716
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:17,165
Locrisantuogolo

717
00:43:18,325 --> 00:43:19,285
Assuntina

718
00:43:19,925 --> 00:43:21,165
replies as follows,

719
00:43:22,205 --> 00:43:23,965
"Gorgeous flowers!

720
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:28,685
Happy Thursday afternoon to you too."

721
00:43:32,525 --> 00:43:34,765
What exactly happened there?

722
00:43:36,885 --> 00:43:38,005
I mean, this...

723
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,885
this exchange,

724
00:43:42,165 --> 00:43:44,285
what is it hiding?

725
00:43:45,845 --> 00:43:49,245
But the most typical thing
seniors do on Facebook is this.

726
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:50,925
Any picture

727
00:43:51,325 --> 00:43:52,845
of any woman

728
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:55,245
under 65 years old

729
00:43:55,325 --> 00:43:56,765
and 95 kilograms

730
00:43:57,205 --> 00:43:59,725
is commented on as follows
by Giacalone Antonio,

731
00:43:59,805 --> 00:44:02,445
"A wonder of nature."

732
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:13,245
Let's talk about cinema now.

733
00:44:13,845 --> 00:44:19,725
I'll ask you a question. It's a question
I can only ask on good nights,

734
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:21,805
because it's a bit divisive.

735
00:44:22,325 --> 00:44:24,925
How many of you,

736
00:44:26,485 --> 00:44:30,645
when a new series or movie
from another country comes out,

737
00:44:31,165 --> 00:44:32,925
go watch it in theaters

738
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:35,285
in original version with subtitles?

739
00:44:39,285 --> 00:44:42,285
I said series too,
but who goes to the movies

740
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:45,525
to watch a foreign language film
with subtitles?

741
00:44:46,845 --> 00:44:49,605
It's usually only three or four people,

742
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,245
a very small number.

743
00:44:51,845 --> 00:44:55,645
I assume the remaining 97 percent
of the audience

744
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:58,645
is afflicted by the notorious
"subtitles migraines".

745
00:44:58,725 --> 00:45:00,165
Where people say,

746
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:04,765
"If I see two subtitles on screen,
I get such headaches...

747
00:45:04,845 --> 00:45:05,765
No, I can't."

748
00:45:05,845 --> 00:45:09,685
And then they go watch
a <i>Fast & Furious</i> marathon

749
00:45:10,565 --> 00:45:14,085
where it feels like cars
are crashing into your face.

750
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:17,045
I mean...

751
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:23,205
I personally see dubbing
as an absolutely unprofitable practice.

752
00:45:23,685 --> 00:45:26,565
Outdated and unnecessary.

753
00:45:27,325 --> 00:45:29,445
I realize it's a radical opinion,

754
00:45:29,525 --> 00:45:32,765
but those of you who agree
know very well that

755
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:35,085
when you say it in public,

756
00:45:35,405 --> 00:45:37,965
someone always flips out.

757
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:40,605
Someone who's not game

758
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:43,205
and wants to give you a lecture.

759
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:45,885
I call him "the smart guy".

760
00:45:47,725 --> 00:45:48,805
"But...

761
00:45:50,045 --> 00:45:52,085
you're totally ignoring

762
00:45:52,405 --> 00:45:55,845
that Italy has a great dubbing tradition.

763
00:45:57,525 --> 00:46:00,125
Think about Ferruccio Amendola,

764
00:46:00,205 --> 00:46:01,325
Oreste Lionello,

765
00:46:01,765 --> 00:46:03,165
Tonino Accolla."

766
00:46:07,205 --> 00:46:08,085
I mean...

767
00:46:08,925 --> 00:46:12,525
Since you're a smart guy,

768
00:46:12,925 --> 00:46:14,365
answer this question.

769
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:16,125
What associates

770
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:17,805
Ferruccio Amendola,

771
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:19,205
Oreste Lionello,

772
00:46:19,285 --> 00:46:20,725
and Tonino Accolla?

773
00:46:22,765 --> 00:46:24,085
They're dead!

774
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:25,765
They're dead.

775
00:46:25,845 --> 00:46:29,725
And, sadly, no one will ever listen
to their voices again.

776
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:32,045
We can't live on tradition.

777
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,525
We won't hear their voices ever again.

778
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:37,245
The only way
to hear Tonino Accolla's voice

779
00:46:37,325 --> 00:46:39,565
is to hold a séance.

780
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,445
Same with Ferruccio Amendola.

781
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:45,965
Imagine how great
a séance with him would be.

782
00:46:46,245 --> 00:46:48,325
He would dub the medium.

783
00:46:50,405 --> 00:46:51,765
"Are you talking to me?

784
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:54,325
Are you talking to me?

785
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,605
Yeah, I'm well, but leave me alone now.

786
00:46:58,165 --> 00:47:01,165
Ma'am, have you tried
Vernel's incredible softness?"

787
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:14,045
Although there still are some good
dubbing actors in movies,

788
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:18,725
the talented children
of the great actors from the '70s,

789
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:21,325
on TV you only hear
their lousy grandchildren.

790
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:25,405
Not only the lousy grandchildren,
but their wives too.

791
00:47:25,485 --> 00:47:29,165
And for some reason, 
the grandchild's brother-in-law too.

792
00:47:29,845 --> 00:47:32,325
This guy who ran a restaurant in Fregene.

793
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:34,965
Then his partner double-crossed him

794
00:47:35,045 --> 00:47:36,765
and they had to shut it down.

795
00:47:37,045 --> 00:47:39,405
So we gave him some dialogues to write,

796
00:47:39,485 --> 00:47:42,685
because he kind of knew how to do it.

797
00:47:42,765 --> 00:47:44,485
He once had a restaurant in the UK.

798
00:47:44,565 --> 00:47:45,925
And that's the problem.

799
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:50,525
Nobody in real life talks like they do
in dubbed TV series.

800
00:47:50,605 --> 00:47:55,565
The way dialogues are written
makes the series unwatchable.

801
00:47:55,645 --> 00:47:58,325
Let's pretend that in the United States

802
00:47:58,405 --> 00:48:00,485
there's this new super-duper series.

803
00:48:00,565 --> 00:48:03,925
It's so good, it's called,
"A New Series of Mary."

804
00:48:05,525 --> 00:48:07,285
The series is released in the US.

805
00:48:07,365 --> 00:48:11,405
It's an awesome series.
I'm sure it'll become your favorite.

806
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:15,605
It's about bribes and corruption
 in Alabama. Just great.

807
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:20,365
Four years later, it comes to Italy
and the problems begin.

808
00:48:20,445 --> 00:48:24,485
Because in the very best case scenario,

809
00:48:24,565 --> 00:48:27,125
the title will be,
"Wait, Here Comes Mary!"

810
00:48:28,765 --> 00:48:32,485
It makes you wonder
if they believe we're retarded.

811
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,165
How little do they think of us?

812
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:39,325
There's this amazing scene

813
00:48:39,405 --> 00:48:41,565
in "A New Series of Mary"

814
00:48:41,645 --> 00:48:43,245
where the main character,

815
00:48:43,325 --> 00:48:45,245
a 180-kilogram African-American,

816
00:48:45,325 --> 00:48:47,325
is standing on the porch

817
00:48:47,405 --> 00:48:51,005
with his buddy, judging
the asses of ladies walking by.

818
00:48:51,085 --> 00:48:53,725
In the Italian version,
he speaks like this.

819
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:55,645
"Hey, Jeff.

820
00:48:56,205 --> 00:48:59,165
Have you seen that hot chick there?

821
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:02,765
I'd slap her little ass till she cries,

822
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:05,965
'Hey, big daddy! I've had enough now.'"

823
00:49:07,165 --> 00:49:08,045
You know...

824
00:49:15,365 --> 00:49:18,085
All great, except for one problem.

825
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:21,405
An African-American who sounds like that
is a dead man.

826
00:49:22,005 --> 00:49:23,205
He lasts three days.

827
00:49:23,565 --> 00:49:27,845
There's another great scene
when his wife turns up.

828
00:49:27,925 --> 00:49:30,805
And she didn't like his remark.

829
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,405
She's a ghetto diva.

830
00:49:32,485 --> 00:49:34,725
So she talks like American ghetto divas.

831
00:49:43,205 --> 00:49:45,125
Then you hear the Italian version.

832
00:49:45,205 --> 00:49:47,765
"Are you kidding me or what?

833
00:49:47,845 --> 00:49:49,645
Can't you keep it down?

834
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:53,325
You're dead wrong if you think
that harlot is better than me!"

835
00:49:55,805 --> 00:49:56,765
And then...

836
00:49:57,045 --> 00:50:00,685
then you see that great scene
that earns an Emmy

837
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:03,845
for the young actor
playing the couple's son.

838
00:50:04,565 --> 00:50:06,845
A 20-year-old African-American kid,

839
00:50:07,445 --> 00:50:08,565
who's very pissed

840
00:50:08,645 --> 00:50:11,845
because his dealer sold him
less crack than he wanted.

841
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:15,045
The original scene is beautiful,

842
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:18,405
because the actor is really furious.

843
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,365
Then you see the Italian version.

844
00:50:38,885 --> 00:50:40,605
"Are you kidding me?

845
00:50:41,325 --> 00:50:43,965
You smoked too much weed.

846
00:50:44,045 --> 00:50:46,285
You're off your head, man!

847
00:50:46,365 --> 00:50:49,205
You know what you are?

848
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:54,685
You're a mudafaka, man!
That's what you are."

849
00:51:06,685 --> 00:51:09,205
We all need to work.

850
00:51:09,285 --> 00:51:13,125
That's fine. I'm not arguing with that.

851
00:51:13,685 --> 00:51:17,965
But dubbing in Italy is in the hands
of about ten families.

852
00:51:18,045 --> 00:51:22,325
Ten tribal groups that carry on
this great folkloristic tradition.

853
00:51:22,405 --> 00:51:24,685
And I love folklore.

854
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:27,485
But let the government take care of them.

855
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:30,525
We'll pay for their licenses,

856
00:51:30,605 --> 00:51:33,165
and they'll open
ten "Cash4Gold" businesses.

857
00:51:34,285 --> 00:51:36,365
So they're good for life.

858
00:51:36,565 --> 00:51:40,885
And finally, all movies in Italy
will be with original audio and subtitles.

859
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,405
But the best part is how cool it would be

860
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:46,205
to go sell your gold in their shops.

861
00:51:47,445 --> 00:51:52,205
"Listen, I've got this gold chain
from my Holy Communion.

862
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:55,645
I was wondering if you could take a look."

863
00:51:55,725 --> 00:51:58,365
"If we could? Of course we can!

864
00:51:58,445 --> 00:52:01,045
Dad, there's a customer with a chain."

865
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:06,485
"Just wait a second, young man.

866
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:09,165
I'll be damned, young man.

867
00:52:10,245 --> 00:52:13,325
This is a really beautiful gold chain.

868
00:52:14,725 --> 00:52:17,725
You could make loads of money
by selling it.

869
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:21,325
Listen to me, you should really sell it.

870
00:52:22,845 --> 00:52:23,925
Tell me something,

871
00:52:24,525 --> 00:52:27,245
you want cash under the table
or a receipt?"

872
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:31,365
"Have you lost your mind, Dad?

873
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:33,605
You want trouble with the flatfoots?

874
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,365
You want to see the coppers walk in?

875
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:41,805
You want another stupid name
we use for policemen?

876
00:52:42,965 --> 00:52:45,445
You want us to end up
like the beer shop owner?

877
00:52:45,525 --> 00:52:48,565
Look, Dad, he's still hanging here!"

878
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:03,165
Thank you very much.

879
00:53:03,485 --> 00:53:06,805
Before we say goodbye,
I'd like to tell you a story.

880
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:11,045
Some nights are good and fun,
like tonight.

881
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:13,605
Some nights are a bit less good.

882
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:16,125
And there are nights that...

883
00:53:17,045 --> 00:53:19,685
leave you with something inside

884
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:21,565
that throbs.

885
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:24,765
That wakes you up during winter nights,

886
00:53:25,405 --> 00:53:27,765
and makes you realize what you are

887
00:53:27,845 --> 00:53:29,605
and what this job means.

888
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:32,365
The worst comedy night of my life

889
00:53:32,445 --> 00:53:35,285
took place on August 12, 2012,

890
00:53:35,605 --> 00:53:39,125
at the Pontecosi Lake Festival

891
00:53:40,205 --> 00:53:42,605
in Castelnuovo di Garfagnana,

892
00:53:43,205 --> 00:53:44,725
Lucca, Tuscany.

893
00:53:45,885 --> 00:53:48,885
At the time, I was in law school.

894
00:53:48,965 --> 00:53:51,765
In was in the library
studying administrative law,

895
00:53:51,845 --> 00:53:54,605
when I get a phone call
from an unknown person.

896
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:56,765
"Hello, Edoardo.

897
00:53:56,845 --> 00:54:01,205
Hi, my name is Amedeo Ciacci,
from Ciacci Management.

898
00:54:01,605 --> 00:54:05,245
You may be familiar with our work.

899
00:54:06,445 --> 00:54:09,005
I'll name you
some recent successful events.

900
00:54:09,685 --> 00:54:12,045
Miss Grosseto, 2004.

901
00:54:12,285 --> 00:54:13,125
No?

902
00:54:13,205 --> 00:54:15,365
The Bread Fair in Fiesole?

903
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:19,645
No? Doesn't matter.
We're organizing a street festival

904
00:54:19,725 --> 00:54:22,685
to celebrate the lake,
booze, pussy, and rock 'n' roll!

905
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:26,045
The usual stuff you do
at street festivals."

906
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:32,205
I say, "Mr. Ciacci,
I am absolutely thrilled by your proposal,

907
00:54:32,285 --> 00:54:35,965
but may I ask why you chose me
for a street festival?"

908
00:54:37,045 --> 00:54:39,965
"Listen, Edoardo,
I'll be very honest with you.

909
00:54:40,925 --> 00:54:44,365
For many years, we had this magician,

910
00:54:44,845 --> 00:54:46,205
his name was Vladimiro.

911
00:54:47,245 --> 00:54:49,045
But he passed away this year."

912
00:54:49,885 --> 00:54:51,085
And I go, "Mr. Ciacci,

913
00:54:51,165 --> 00:54:54,365
how could I refuse
such a flattering invitation?

914
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:56,605
Send me an e-mail with the details."

915
00:54:56,685 --> 00:54:57,525
I hang up.

916
00:54:57,605 --> 00:55:00,325
I completely forget about Mr. Ciacci.

917
00:55:00,405 --> 00:55:02,645
Months go by. Summer comes.

918
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:04,805
I fail the administrative law test.

919
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,725
Everything goes as expected.

920
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:11,005
And soon after, it's August 12, 2012.

921
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:13,405
I was on holiday at the beach.

922
00:55:13,485 --> 00:55:14,565
I get in the car

923
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,885
and head to Castelnuovo di Garfagnana.

924
00:55:17,405 --> 00:55:19,765
From the highway, I see these clouds

925
00:55:19,845 --> 00:55:21,845
that make up the writing "redrum".

926
00:55:22,805 --> 00:55:26,205
"Redrum,"
spoken by Amedeo Ciacci's voice.

927
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:29,925
I arrive at Castelnuovo.
I knew there was a lake.

928
00:55:30,005 --> 00:55:31,485
It was the Lake Festival.

929
00:55:31,725 --> 00:55:34,205
So I walk up to this man on the road

930
00:55:34,285 --> 00:55:36,765
and ask him for directions to the lake.

931
00:55:36,845 --> 00:55:41,245
"You have to take the path
that goes behind the church,

932
00:55:41,325 --> 00:55:44,085
then turn right and keep going,
but the lake is gone."

933
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:48,325
"What do you mean, 'It's gone'?"

934
00:55:48,405 --> 00:55:51,405
"You could have taken the path
that goes behind the church,

935
00:55:51,485 --> 00:55:54,205
turn left and then right,
but the lake is gone.

936
00:55:59,885 --> 00:56:02,845
I may look like a David Lynch character

937
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:05,685
but I am real."

938
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:09,605
I turn towards the road
indicated by the man,

939
00:56:09,685 --> 00:56:12,005
and when I turn back to him, he's gone.

940
00:56:12,085 --> 00:56:15,085
I drive down to the lake and see

941
00:56:15,165 --> 00:56:16,765
that the old man was right.

942
00:56:16,845 --> 00:56:19,925
Lake Pontecosi is an artificial lake

943
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:21,925
with a dam below it.

944
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:25,245
And one week before the comedian arrives,

945
00:56:25,325 --> 00:56:27,525
the power company drains the lake.

946
00:56:27,605 --> 00:56:31,125
It was the Lake Festival without the lake.

947
00:56:31,525 --> 00:56:33,405
To give you an idea of how...

948
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:38,885
haunting the view of a drained lake is,

949
00:56:38,965 --> 00:56:41,725
think that whatever lies on the lake bed

950
00:56:41,805 --> 00:56:44,205
can be seen when there's no water.

951
00:56:44,605 --> 00:56:46,685
So you'd see dead branches,

952
00:56:47,205 --> 00:56:49,085
mud, snakes,

953
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:51,045
old Fiat Duna carcasses,

954
00:56:52,005 --> 00:56:56,085
bodies of local old guys
killed after a Briscola game gone wrong,

955
00:56:56,525 --> 00:56:57,605
adulterers...

956
00:56:57,685 --> 00:57:00,485
That was the view right before my eyes.

957
00:57:03,245 --> 00:57:06,325
I look at the audience
in Castelnuovo di Garfagnana,

958
00:57:06,405 --> 00:57:08,245
who I was supposed to entertain,

959
00:57:08,325 --> 00:57:11,445
and it's made up
of either children under six

960
00:57:11,525 --> 00:57:13,885
or adults over 96.

961
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:16,685
As if a very selective strain of Ebola

962
00:57:17,085 --> 00:57:19,725
had decimated my audience for the night.

963
00:57:20,405 --> 00:57:23,925
I look at the stage
where I was about to perform.

964
00:57:24,005 --> 00:57:25,885
And I will never forget this.

965
00:57:25,965 --> 00:57:29,405
There was a dance recital
of the Duckling Dance School

966
00:57:29,485 --> 00:57:31,405
from Castelnuovo di Garfagnana.

967
00:57:31,845 --> 00:57:35,045
Children dancing this nice choreography

968
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:39,325
to the beat of<i></i>"I Gotta Feeling
That Tonight's Gonna Be a Good Night"

969
00:57:39,605 --> 00:57:40,965
by The Black Eyed Peas.

970
00:57:41,805 --> 00:57:44,685
I glance at the lake,
which was no longer there,

971
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:47,645
I glance at the audience,
then at the stage,

972
00:57:48,325 --> 00:57:52,165
and unlike will.i.am
from The Black Eyed Peas,

973
00:57:52,525 --> 00:57:54,405
I got a feeling that tonight

974
00:57:55,565 --> 00:57:57,565
is not gonna be a good night.

975
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:01,765
Amedeo Ciacci goes on stage
and introduces me

976
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:04,085
with these words.

977
00:58:04,445 --> 00:58:08,445
"Now give a round of applause
to a great, very great comedian.

978
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:12,285
He's from Rome.
Please welcome Edoardo Ferraris!"

979
00:58:13,885 --> 00:58:16,125
Edoardo Ferraris walks on stage.

980
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:22,685
And I start with this joke
I had prepared to break the ice.

981
00:58:23,645 --> 00:58:26,285
"Good evening, Castelnuovo di Garfagnana.

982
00:58:26,365 --> 00:58:28,605
This is the Lake Festival, but...

983
00:58:28,685 --> 00:58:30,805
it looks like someone drained it!"

984
00:58:39,125 --> 00:58:40,885
The microphone hisses.

985
00:58:42,205 --> 00:58:47,805
Then I say another silly thing
I had written as an ice breaker.

986
00:58:47,885 --> 00:58:50,925
A joke about something
that happened two days earlier.

987
00:58:51,805 --> 00:58:53,245
"Castelnuovo di Garfagnana!

988
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:55,485
Have you heard about the 'suitcase man'?

989
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:59,245
The tourist who fell asleep
on the baggage belt at Berlin airport?

990
00:58:59,325 --> 00:59:01,085
Luckily, it wasn't Rome Fiumicino,

991
00:59:01,165 --> 00:59:03,645
otherwise, they would have lost him!"

992
00:59:12,285 --> 00:59:14,725
Children are staring at me terrified.

993
00:59:16,565 --> 00:59:18,405
And old man hocks a loogie.

994
00:59:19,725 --> 00:59:24,245
And I hear the clear sound
of someone loading a shotgun.

995
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,325
I talk half an hour into the void.

996
00:59:28,405 --> 00:59:31,405
I was alone, as if I was in my bedroom.

997
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:34,085
They looked angry
and I wanted to kill myself.

998
00:59:34,165 --> 00:59:37,325
I wanted to jump into the lake,
but there wasn't one.

999
00:59:38,365 --> 00:59:40,765
Half-way through my show, there's a break.

1000
00:59:40,845 --> 00:59:42,045
I get off the stage,

1001
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:45,405
and backstage
Mr. Ciacci is coming towards me

1002
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:47,685
now looking pretty mad.

1003
00:59:47,765 --> 00:59:48,925
He grabs me and says,

1004
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:51,445
"You haven't got it right!"

1005
00:59:51,525 --> 00:59:54,125
He slams me into the wall
and says the meanest thing

1006
00:59:54,205 --> 00:59:56,445
I've ever heard someone say about someone.

1007
00:59:56,525 --> 00:59:58,925
"Edoardo, no more complicated jokes.

1008
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:00,485
They're shepherds!"

1009
01:00:08,045 --> 01:00:11,925
Spoken by the guy
who had organized the event. So...

1010
01:00:13,165 --> 01:00:15,565
I have an epiphany and think,

1011
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,565
"He's right. Amedeo Ciacci's right.

1012
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:22,445
They're not the problem. I am.

1013
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:26,125
They're shepherds,
no more complicated jokes.

1014
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,485
Talk about something
they're interested in.

1015
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:32,485
And show the same confidence

1016
01:00:32,805 --> 01:00:34,365
Enrico Brignano has."

1017
01:00:36,885 --> 01:00:38,365
I go back on stage.

1018
01:00:38,645 --> 01:00:40,605
I look at my audience and think,

1019
01:00:40,685 --> 01:00:42,245
"From now on,

1020
01:00:42,685 --> 01:00:45,885
you are the Enrico Brignano
of shepherding."

1021
01:00:50,045 --> 01:00:54,205
When I was a kid,
my grandpa had this huge book,

1022
01:00:54,285 --> 01:00:57,085
so huge that you couldn't use it
as a door holder,

1023
01:00:57,165 --> 01:00:59,485
you had to use it as a gate holder.

1024
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:02,845
One day I went to him and asked,

1025
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,525
"Why do they call sheep 'ovine'?"

1026
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:07,205
He goes, "Because they make wine."

1027
01:01:07,285 --> 01:01:11,045
So I say, "Grandpa, tell me,
do they make milk too?"

1028
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,245
He says, "Yeah.

1029
01:01:12,325 --> 01:01:15,365
Sicilian sheep make almond milk.
African sheep make coconut milk.

1030
01:01:15,445 --> 01:01:17,445
Chinese sheep make soy milk."

1031
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:20,925
I ask, "What do we call young sheep?"

1032
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:22,605
He says, "Lambs."

1033
01:01:22,685 --> 01:01:24,205
I say, "And when they're old?"

1034
01:01:24,285 --> 01:01:26,445
"They're called <i>arrosticini."</i>

1035
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:29,285
I had them in the palm of my hand!

1036
01:01:29,885 --> 01:01:33,245
A star was shining in the Garfagnana sky,

1037
01:01:33,325 --> 01:01:34,805
and that star was me.

1038
01:01:34,885 --> 01:01:38,365
And just when I thought
I had won over the audience,

1039
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:40,165
they screwed me.

1040
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:44,685
"Now cut this shit out.
We've had enough of this shit.

1041
01:01:44,765 --> 01:01:46,525
Play Dario Fo in <i>Mistero buffo."</i>

1042
01:01:46,605 --> 01:01:47,685
"Hang on!

1043
01:01:48,925 --> 01:01:49,765
Dario Fo?"

1044
01:01:49,845 --> 01:01:51,845
"Yes, Dario Fo. Play <i>Mistero buffo."</i>

1045
01:01:51,925 --> 01:01:53,285
"Okay."

1046
01:01:53,365 --> 01:01:56,045
Enrico Brignano of shepherding is out,

1047
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:58,205
I'm Dario Fo of shepherding now.

1048
01:01:58,285 --> 01:02:02,405
"The shepherd of Garfagnana 
travels back to Garfagnana.

1049
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:04,965
He milks the Garfagnana's sheep.

1050
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:07,325
Milk from Garfagnana's good."

1051
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:12,285
Ladies and gentlemen, I was once again
surfing the wave of success in Garfagnana

1052
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:14,925
when the audience screws me over
one more time.

1053
01:02:15,005 --> 01:02:18,245
"Cut that shit out. Enough with Dario Fo.

1054
01:02:18,325 --> 01:02:20,525
Do Matthew McConaughey
in <i>True Detective."</i>

1055
01:02:20,605 --> 01:02:21,525
"Hang on!

1056
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:26,085
How come you've already seen
<i>True Detective?</i>

1057
01:02:26,725 --> 01:02:29,485
It won't be out here
for another three years."

1058
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:32,805
"We already have Netflix here, asshole.

1059
01:02:34,565 --> 01:02:37,085
Don't you read...

1060
01:02:37,165 --> 01:02:39,605
You don't know how to do it, huh?

1061
01:02:39,685 --> 01:02:42,405
You download a Torrent,
change your IP address,

1062
01:02:42,565 --> 01:02:44,405
then you can watch it.

1063
01:02:44,685 --> 01:02:47,165
Don't you read Salvatore Aranzulla's blog?

1064
01:02:48,925 --> 01:02:51,765
You people in Rome
only read repubblica.it?"

1065
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:54,525
Fine! I'm no longer Dario Fo
of shepherding,

1066
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:57,045
now I'm Matthew McConaughey
in <i>True Detective.</i>

1067
01:02:57,125 --> 01:03:00,205
I'm the Rust Cohle of shepherding.

1068
01:04:01,365 --> 01:04:03,325
Thank you all. Good night.
