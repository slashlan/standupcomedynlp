00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,560
-[Kevin] Yo.
-What's up?

3
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,603
I was looking
all over the house for y'all.

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:21,730
[Eniko] We're just chilling.

5
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,149
About to go downstairs,
get some work done. What up, champ?

6
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:26,067
-[imperceptible]
-Finish your homework?

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,944
-[Eniko] No.
-Look in my eyes.

8
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,654
-[Kenzo babbling]
-You're lying.

9
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,282
Finish your homework.
Stop playing with me. [chuckles]

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,491
Zo, give Daddy two.

11
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,618
Ah, ah. Give me a boom.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,995
Boom! Give me a headbutt.

13
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,039
[grunts] Give me a kiss.

14
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,999
-Why're you looking at me?
-Love you.

15
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,208
-Give me a kiss.
-Okay.

16
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:43,793
-Love you.
-Heaven, finish your work?

17
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,045
Oh, yes, for the most part.

18
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,088
-See you all when I come back up.
-[Kenzo babbles]

19
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,089
-[Eniko] Bye!
-[Heaven] Bye.

20
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,132

Ooh.

23
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,682
Daddy about to have a good time.

24
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,978
Big cube, coming in. Taste it.

25
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,021
[slurps] Mmm.

26
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,940
Ha-ya!

27
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,442
Yeah.

28
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:08,777
Hey.

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,154
Wow!

30
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,406
The GOAT. Legend.

31
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,283
Inspiration.

32
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,367
My man.

[cheering and applauding]

34
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,086
Aww. So nice.

35
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,504
Oh, man!

36
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,716
Well, thank you. Thank you.

37
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:37,096
Well, thank you. Thank you!

38
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,600
Much appreciated. Stop it.

39
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,437
Sit down.

40
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,357
I appreciate it. Thank you.

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,609
-Hello. Hi.
-[crowd whoops]

42
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,114
I can say hello. First time
I've been this intimate with a crowd.

43
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,158
So, I can say hello
and I can actually get a hello back.

44
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,536
So, I'mma say it again.
Hello. How y'all doing? Good?

45
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,037
-[crowd cheering]
-That's good. I like it.

46
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,539
This feels right to me.

47
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,542
-This feels right.
-[woman] Yeah!

48
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,670
I've been in a lot of
different spaces to tell some jokes.

49
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:11,297
Been in fucking stadiums,
arenas, theaters.

50
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,552
This right now feels right, in the comfort
of my own fucking home. Thank you.

51
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,595
-[crowd applauding]
-Thank you.

52
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,140
Getting back to the basics.

53
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,310
I wanna explain to you guys
why I'm actually in my house.

54
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,728
We're here for a reason.

55
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:29,941
I'm no longer comfortable
anywhere else but my house.

56
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,278
I'm being very fucking honest
with you guys. I am not comfortable

57
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,530
anywhere except my house.

58
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,115
And it's for a lot of reasons.

59
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,076
I feel like we should get into those.
Let's address the elephant in the room.

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,412
-Reason number one, COVID.
-[crowd exclaims]

61
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,080
COVID.

62
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,916
Where you at right now?
Where's your panic level?

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,461
High? In the middle? Low?
Where you at? Be honest, let me know.

64
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,506
Middle? High? Low?
Kind of high? A little bit?

65
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,718
-[crowd mumbling]
-News flash. I had it!

66
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,469
That's right, I had the 'VID.

67
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,806
The 'VID-19 was in my system.

68
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,603
I had it in the beginning when it
wasn't cool, when it wasn't a trend.

69
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,814
It was me and Tom Hanks.
We was the only two.

70
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,775
[chuckles] I had to keep it a secret

71
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,529
because Tom Hanks
is a much bigger star than I am.

72
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,656
He will swallow my fucking announcement.

73
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,661
He's Forrest Gump. You're not
gonna beat Forrest Gump. No shot.

74
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,914
No fucking shot I'mma beat Forrest Gump.

75
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,168
If it was somebody lesser than, I would've
dropped that bitch in a heartbeat.

76
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,588
David Hasselhoff. Fuck David Hasselhoff.

77
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,798
Ain't nobody give a shit
about David Hasselhoff.

78
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,258
Boom! Dropped it.

79
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,678
"Kevin Hart's got it, too.
Save Kevin Hart. #TheVID."

80
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,306
You know why I call it the 'VID?

81
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,018
It's the closest thing to AIDS.
It just sounds as dangerous as AIDS.

82
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,063
The 'VID. "You got the 'VID? Fuck, man!"

83
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,941
"I got the 'VID."
"You got the 'VID? Shit!"

84
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,152
"Praying for you.
You got the fucking 'VID."

85
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,529
I didn't know I had it.

86
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,282
I didn't know I had it, man.
I had no symptoms at all.

87
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,618
No fever, no headache,
no body aches, nothing.

88
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,996
Now, my wife lost
her sense of taste and her sense of smell.

89
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,250
She told me, "Babe, I think I got it.
We should get tested."

90
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,752
I said, "Well, we don't have a problem."

91
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,422
"You got the fucking problem.
Why do I have to get tested?"

92
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,634
"I can taste and smell fine.
Why the fuck do I gotta get tested?"

93
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,846
Doctor came over to the house.
Doctor came over, tested both of us.

94
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,642
Said, "You guys are both positive."
I said, "Bullshit."

95
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,354
"Bullshit! No way I'm fucking positive."

96
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,108
I immediately touched my nose twice.
Ah, ah. "Could I do that?"

97
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,569
"If I had the 'VID, could I fucking
do this two times in a row?"

98
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,906
Can't touch your nose
with the 'VID. Everybody knows that.

99
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,868
Said, "Mr. Hart, I'm very serious.
You're positive."

100
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,454
This caused an uproar
in my household, immediately.

101
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,957
Me and my wife go at each other's throats,

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,710
"Who the fuck
brought the 'VID up in this house?"

103
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,545
"Who was it?"

104
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,381
Got to see how we felt
about each other's friends.

105
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,427
"It was that nasty bitch Pam you
always hanging with. That's who did it."

106
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,053
"Dirty-foot bitch."

107
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:07,765
"Her feet dirty. She tracked the 'VID
all through the goddamn house."

108
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,143
"Dirty-foot Pam did it." [chuckles]

109
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,354
"Got the fucking 'VID
all in this goddamn house."

110
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,648
"Wash the carpets immediately."

111
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:19,569
Doctor calmed me down, "Calm down, Kevin."

112
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,031
"It'll pass.
Take ten to fourteen days. Relax."

113
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,283
"Chill out. Drink some tea."

114
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,119
That's what the doctor
told me to my fucking face.

115
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,329
"Drink some tea."

116
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,872
Are you kidding me?

117
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,041
"I got the fucking 'VID, Doc!"

118
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,835
"The hell is tea gonna do for me?"

119
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,380
"Where's my ventilator?"
That's what I said. "Where is it?"

120
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,841
"I'm supposed to get a ventilator.
Everybody knows that."

121
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,261
"You get a ventilator with the 'VID.
That's what they say in the blogs."

122
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,015
"You'll be fine, Mr. Hart,
you'll be fine."

123
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,101
When the doctor told me that,
my level of panic lowered.

124
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,479
Keep in mind, I was at
the highest level in the beginning.

125
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,314
Oh, my God.

126
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:57,607
When it first hit,

127
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,443
oh, my fucking God,
I didn't know what to do.

128
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,945
I went and put gas
in all the fucking cars.

129
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,614
-[crowd laughs]
-[chuckles]

130
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,324
You gotta be able to escape.

131
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,284
These motherfuckers
turning into zombies here.

132
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,202
I was scared.

133
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,039
Went and bought all the water
and toilet paper I could find.

134
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,333
Still don't know why
we went on this toilet paper kick.

135
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,376
What was so special about toilet paper?

136
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,753
Nobody told me.

137
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,798
Did the 'VID make you shit?
What was it? What… [chuckles]

138
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,217
We bought all the fucking toilet paper.

139
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,052
Dry noodles, I got it all!

140
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,931
The mask, I went crazy with the mask.

141
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,517
In the beginning,
I didn't know what mask to buy.

142
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,977
Had a regular mask.
My friend told me, "Hey, man,

143
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,981
that ain't the right mask,
the 'VID gonna get through that mask."

144
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,692
"That mask ain't gonna
protect you against the 'VID."

145
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:46,322
"Fuck! Are you serious?"
"I'm serious. You gotta get the N95s."

146
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,740
"Oh, shit."

147
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,577
Went on a website,
I bought every N95 I saw.

148
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,622
I spent 20 grand on N95s.

149
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,290
[crowd laughing]

150
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,544
Went outside the day after, I saw
a nigga with a titty cup on his face.

151
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,503
Wasn't even a…

152
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,590
With a bra strap.
What the fuck? That's not a N95.

153
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,635
That's a A-cup bra.
What the hell just happened?

154
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,264
He didn't spend 20 grand on that. No way.

155
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,349
Somebody duped me, man.

156
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,727
My wife told me flat-out,
"Babe, you know what?"

157
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,605
"This thing is messing with your head.
You gotta get out this house."

158
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,940
"You gotta get out the house."

159
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,152
I said, "There is nothing
outside this house for me."

160
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,322
"Nothing. There's no reason
for me to go outside this house."

161
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,365
"No shot."

162
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,493
"The things that are outside
this house, I have no interest in."

163
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,205
"There's people out there.
I don't like people." I said it.

164
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,751
Cat's out the bag.
I don't fucking like people anymore.

165
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,378
You won. You beat me up.

166
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,714
You fucking won, man.

167
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:45,631
You know how?

168
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,677
Because you guys have managed to
fuck up the best job in the world, man.

169
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,346
At one point in time,
fame was the most sought-after

170
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,599
and best job on the fucking planet.

171
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,018
If you didn't have it,
you wanted a piece of it.

172
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,395
You wanted to taste a little bit of it.

173
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,606
I got it.
I got to the highest level of it,

174
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,025
and then you fucked me,
oh, you fucked me good.

175
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,862
Oh, this generation fucked me good.

176
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,656
Everything's gotta be compromised.

177
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,742
Everything's gotta be
videoed in this generation.

178
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,077
If it's not on video, it never happened.

179
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,246
That's how this generation lives.

180
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,125
Let me tell you guys the scariest thing
that you could do to a Black man in 1986

181
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,252
if you were the cops or the feds.

182
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,715
Scariest thing that you could do is tell
a Black man that you had him on tape.

183
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,261
If the feds came up to you, "We got
your ass on tape. You going to jail."

184
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,138
He'll shit himself, "What? Who? Me?"

185
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,516
"On tape?"

186
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,976
Oh! He'd start crying.

187
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,353
[mimics crying]

188
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,812
[crowd laughs]

189
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,064
"I'm on fucking tape."

190
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,233
[mimics crying]

191
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,611
"All y'all going to fucking jail.
We got all y'all on tape."

192
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,490
He'll tell all his friends,
"Come out, Calvin, Marcus, Terrence."

193
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,325
"They got us. Anthony, you, too."

194
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,787
"Said they got us all on tape.
We're going to jail, apparently."

195
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,122
"We're going to fucking jail."

196
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,541
[mimics crying]

197
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,292
"We on tape."

198
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,337
That's all the feds had to say,
"Got your ass on tape."

199
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,383
Scariest thing you could do.

200
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:14,178
You guys don't even realize
that you're the feds… for free.

201
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,431
You're not even getting paid.
For fucking free.

202
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,059
You're just
telling on people all goddamn day.

203
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,771
Just a bunch of walking fucking snitches.
It's disgusting.

204
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,440
It's disgusting.

205
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,777
I went to McDonald's…
This is a true story.

206
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:33,155
I go to McDonald's.
I'm at the drive-through, right?

207
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,825
I want a Big Mac Meal.
I haven't had one in so long.

208
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,703
I'm so excited for this fucking Big Mac.

209
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,122
Oh, my God,
I can't wait to get this Big Mac.

210
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,292
I get the Big Mac. I'm so excited.
I pull over in the parking lot.

211
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,085
I start fucking the Big Mac up.

212
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,797
Smashing it.
It's all over my face, everything.

213
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,215
I'm happy as hell.

214
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,468
I turn to my left, it's a woman
outside the window taping me.

215
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,178
She said, "Got your ass."

216
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,308
I got nervous.
"What the fuck is you doing, lady?"

217
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,518
She said, "Mmm-mmm. But I got your ass."

218
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,644
[scoffs]

219
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,231
"What the fuck you mean,
got my ass? What am I doing?"

220
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:11,027
I'm so nervous, I dropped the burger.
I just dropped the fucking burger.

221
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,781
I grabbed my phone, I went to Twitter,
I issued an apology via social media.

222
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,535
I said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."

223
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,624
The reason why I apologized is
because two days earlier, I announced

224
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,585
that I was going
plant-based full-time. I'd just said it.

225
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:32,340
This video was detrimental to
everything that I stood for at the moment.

226
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:33,507
[chuckles]

227
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,385
Had to issue an apology
to the plant-based community.

228
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,679
Became an ally.

229
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,184
Made a donation, was a part
of protest. I had to do what I could.

230
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,937
Stood by the side of cows,
took pictures. It was a lot.

231
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:51,108
I don't like what you guys
have made me become.

232
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,320
I don't like it.
I'm no longer comfortable.

233
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,946
You switched it on me.

234
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,864
Fuck!

235
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,283
You switched it on me, man.

236
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:03,037
For the longest time, celebrities
looked at people as the weird people.

237
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,956
"Them motherfuckers
get weird sometimes, man."

238
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,209
"People get weird."
That's how we looked at people.

239
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,670
You switched it.
We're the weird people now.

240
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,340
You look at us like, "What the fuck is
wrong with him?" We're the weird people.

241
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,468
I don't know how to act in public.
"Hey, why are you staring?"

242
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,886
"What's going on, man?"

243
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:21,347
I think everybody knows.
"Get your hands out your pocket."

244
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,807
"What's happening, man? Come on."

245
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,519
"Fuck you about to do to me?
You about to eat me? Come on, man."

246
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,021
"The fuck you talking about?
Nobody worried about your ass."

247
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,816
"Bullshit. Look at that guy
looking at me in his glasses."

248
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,320
"I know somebody thinks I'm dinner when
I see it. They trying to eat me here."

249
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,532
Making crazy accusations
all over the fucking place.

250
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,660
Losing my mind. Going crazy.

251
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:46,330
You guys got me living my life
like a successful drug dealer.

252
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,708
It's a true story. True story.
There was a time,

253
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,628
if you wanted to come to my house
to talk to me, you had to get naked.

254
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,921
Get in the fucking pool.

255
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,341
How else would I know that you're
not wearing a wire? "Who you with?"

256
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,718
"E!? People? Who the fuck is you with?"

257
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,680
"Came here for a story
for the tabloids. I don't trust you, Dad."

258
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,722
[chuckles]

259
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,642
"I'm your father." "Shut up, bitch!"

260
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,104
"Who you been talking to, Dad?"
"Get in the pool."

261
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,773
"Finish this conversation in six feet."

262
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,694
"Switch that. Four.
Go to four feet. I can't see. Go to four."

263
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,197
This is where I am.

264
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,284
This is where I am.

265
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,912
My wife says the same things,
"Honey, you're getting old."

266
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,416
"Getting angry, irritable.
Need to get out and get back to yourself."

267
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,794
"Get back to your ways of old.
You can't live like this."

268
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:38,382
I decided to start doing stand-up again.
I said, "Baby, you're right. I need to go

269
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,136
and start doing stand-up comedy
again." That's how I get back to myself.

270
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,637
That's how I get back to me.

271
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:44,763
[crowd applauding]

272
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,726
I told my friends I was
gonna start doing comedy again.

273
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,437
They said, "Gonna talk
about your wife and kids again?"

274
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,898
I said, "What else do I have?"

275
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,567
I don't have nothing else.

276
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,652
All my bitches left after the sex tape.

277
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,988
Every bitch I had, left.

278
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:05,659
Every one of them. "Where you going,
Lorraine? Gladys? Pearl?" [chuckles]

279
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,620
"Where you going?"

280
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,415
These are older names
'cause I had older bitches at the time.

281
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,461
"Get back here, Ethel. Come on, man."

282
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,588
"Don't do this to me."

283
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,798
"Magnus, come on, please." [chuckles]

284
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:21,884
"Please don't do this."

285
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,179
"Loretta, you can't leave. Come on."

286
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,808
What else do I have?

287
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,143
I have to.

288
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,146
Talking about my kids is a must, man.

289
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,190
It's a must.
They're part of my everyday life.

290
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,901
I don't know what else to talk about,

291
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,487
outside of the things
that I go through on the daily.

292
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,489
My kids are with me on a daily.

293
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,868
Two teenagers, one three-year-old,
a baby that could be here any day now.

294
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,828
-Any day, any fucking day now.
-[crowd applauding]

295
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,168
About to throw these balls in the trash.
I ain't having no more fucking babies.

296
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,796
I'mma roof these balls
after this fucking baby come.

297
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,215
I'mma take both balls,
throw them on the fucking roof.

298
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,633
You can kiss my ass

299
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,511
thinking another child is coming
out of these balls, I promise.

300
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:08,055
You're a fucking liar
if you say it's my baby.

301
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,558
Balls in the trash after this baby.

302
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:14,770
My daughter and I are
closer than we've ever been.

303
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,522
My daughter's boy crazy.

304
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,523
Boy crazy.

305
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,858
Once again, I gotta act like I like it.

306
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,695
I don't. You gotta act like you do.

307
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,530
I love this. I love that, in my specials,

308
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,742
you get to see
the growth of my fucking kids.

309
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,452
You see their development.

310
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,912
They're getting older, man.

311
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:34,915
Daughter told me she likes
this boy named Matt at her school.

312
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,168
"Dad, I like this boy named Matt.
Oh, my God. He's so cute."

313
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,337
"He makes me laugh. I want him."

314
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,423
"What the fuck does that mean?"

315
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,632
"What does that mean?"

316
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:47,553
"I want him." "What the fuck
are you saying, little girl?"

317
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,181
"Should I tell him?"
"If that's how you feel, tell him."

318
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,684
She goes to school,
tells him how she feels, comes home,

319
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,771
"Dad, oh, my God. Guess what?
Matt likes me back. We're a thing."

320
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,773
"Good for you, honey.
That makes me happy."

321
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,859
"Do me a favor, keep it
in the kid space, though."

322
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,068
"Okay, Dad."

323
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,279
She comes back home two days later.

324
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,782
"Dad, I don't like Matt no more.
I like this boy named Rob now."

325
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,911
"He look better, he make me laugh more.
That's who I really want."

326
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,747
"It happens.
Sometimes you think you like somebody,

327
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,459
you meet somebody else, you realize
that's the person you liked all along."

328
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,501
"It's called life."

329
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,963
"Make it happen. Move on.
Be honest with the other person."

330
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,298
"All right, Dad, I love you."

331
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,841
"Keep it in the kid space."

332
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,595
A week goes by.
"Dad, I don't like Rob no more."

333
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,013
"I like this boy named Tim."

334
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,765
Instantly, in my mind,

335
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,267
I said, "My daughter a ho.
This is ho shit."

336
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,978
"This is ho shit."

337
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,482
-Ho activity right in front of my face.
-[crowd laughs]

338
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,152
I immediately called a ho
that I knew from the past.

339
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,030
Asked her if this is how
it went down for her.

340
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,325
Three boys back-to-back.
She said, "Yup, the same way."

341
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,996
"Next thing I knew, I was plucking balls
in the bathroom." What is happening?

342
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,958
Don't want my baby plucking balls.
I gotta save her.

343
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:01,710
What I gotta do is see these boys.

344
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,338
Went to the school. I wanted to
see 'em, what they look like.

345
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,006
I saw 'em.

346
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,841
Saw Matt first. Gotta be honest.

347
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,220
Charming little kid,
personality was out of this world.

348
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,848
I see why she likes Matt.
I see it. I get it.

349
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:16,934
Charming little boy. I get it.

350
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:21,855
Personality, funny guy.
I see why you like Matt. I get it.

351
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,109
Then Rob walked in. Rob walked in.

352
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:28,362
I didn't look at Matt again.
I forgot all about Matt.

353
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,699
Who the fuck is Matt?
Rob had a different thing.

354
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,242
Personality popped.

355
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,285
Had a bunch of pizzazz, flair.

356
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,246
Used his hands a lot when he talked.

357
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,000
This kid's got something.

358
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,002
I see why she don't like fucking Matt.

359
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,422
Then Tim walked in.
Tim had on leather pants…

360
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,424
with some Heelys.

361
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,593
You know how confident you gotta be
to wear leather pants in high school?

362
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,721
A Black kid with leather pants.

363
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,681
There's no Black kid
that I've ever heard about

364
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,766
that wore leather pants
outside of Lenny Kravitz.

365
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,184
That's the only Black man.

366
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,646
And it's a rumor that
Lenny did it at a young age.

367
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:05,858
Tim had Heelys on,
just slid through the fucking room.

368
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,901
Jesus Christ, man.

369
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,821
Cigarettes under his arms.
I said, "Do you smoke?"

370
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,449
He said, "It's just a look,"
as he was gliding by me. [chuckles]

371
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,408
-Fuck.
-[crowd laughing]

372
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,493
Kids today are different.

373
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,580
My son and my daughter
are on two different pages.

374
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,582
Shit makes me laugh. Always have been.

375
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,126
Always have been
two completely different pages.

376
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,588
My son is… He's what you call…
What do they call it today?

377
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,923
What are the kids
called today, when the kids are…

378
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,134
Dumb. There it is. I got it. Dumb.

379
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,054
Struggling academically.

380
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,557
I know you guys are like, "Don't call
your kid dumb." Why not? He's mine.

381
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,101
Chip off the old fucking block.

382
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:44,521
Not like I'm standing up here as
a smart-ass man. I was dumb as shit, too.

383
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,648
Worked out for me so far.

384
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,859
Dumb is the right way
to go in my household.

385
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,027
[crowd applauding]

386
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,445
It's the right way to go.

387
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,741
Then it pisses me off
as the school constantly calls me

388
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,953
to remind me
of my son's educational problems.

389
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,955
"Mr. Hart, he failed another test."

390
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,124
"Mr. Hart, his grades are dropping."

391
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,294
"Want to discuss your son's grades?"
"They continue to drop."

392
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,546
I snapped on 'em, "Don't call me no more."

393
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,257
"Don't call me about
his grades no more. Call him."

394
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,802
"Call him. That's his problem.
It's not my problem."

395
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:18,263
"Last I checked, I went to school.
I passed. I'm successful."

396
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:22,226
"I'm not going to school again. He needs
to fucking pass that class, not me."

397
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,352
"Call him."

398
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:27,231
Private schools, man,
they got this weird thing.

399
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,234
I'm not that much of a fan
of private schools, I'll be honest.

400
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,736
I am not a fan of private schools at all.

401
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,115
Yes, my kids attend private schools.
Doesn't mean I'm a fan of it.

402
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,618
I feel like private schools
protect kids from reality.

403
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,789
They protect you.
They protect you from fucking reality.

404
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,958
Private school…

405
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,253
Private schools breed bitches.
That's how I feel. I said it.

406
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,755
I said it. I'm not taking it back.
That's how I feel.

407
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,466
Private schools breed bitches.

408
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:58,011
I'm in my comfort zone,
I'mma let it fly today.

409
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,597
Everything that I fucking feel, I'mma say.

410
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,893
You ever see a grown man get punched
in the face that went to private school?

411
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,436
He immediately looks for a teacher.

412
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,980
[mimics exclaiming]

413
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,363
He just… He gives you five of these…
"Huh."

414
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,823
"I don't know. Why?"

415
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:21,952
Looking for somebody to
tell him why. "I don't know. Why? What?"

416
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,246
"We gotta have an arbitration.
When's the meeting?"

417
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,373
Public schools, now that's different.

418
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,334
Public schools, you got no choice
but to grow the fuck up.

419
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,004
You got no choice
but to grow up in public schools.

420
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,631
It's a pot of fuckshit.
They just throw you in it.

421
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,011
They just throw you in it. Nobody
prepares you for the shit you gonna see.

422
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:42,306
I saw my first
white person in public school.

423
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,766
I didn't know what the fuck it was.

424
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,478
It was the only one there.
"What the fuck is that? Jesus Christ!"

425
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,232
I thought it was somebody
from Star Wars, "That's a stormtrooper."

426
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,068
"It's a fucking stormtrooper right there."

427
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,946
Just a white person walking down the hall.

428
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,364
I was making the noises…

429
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,033
[mimics blaster]

430
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,870
"It's a fucking stormtrooper. No?"

431
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,872
"No, that's a white person."

432
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,416
"I never knew.
Nobody told me what it was."

433
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,794
Public school throws you
into a pot of fuckshit.

434
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,379
Everything is there.

435
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,966
White people, Black people,
Mexican, Chinese, Puerto Rican.

436
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,344
Fat, skinny, gay, straight.

437
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,222
Dirty, clean. It's all there.

438
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,016
They just push you in.
You gotta figure it out.

439
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,309
Kids are scared.

440
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,019
[mimics exclaiming]

441
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,441
They run straight to the teacher,
"I'm scared. Help."

442
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,401
The teacher answer, "Me, too, bitch.

443
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,365
"Walked through the same metal detectors.
Don't think I'm scared?"

444
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,785
"Keep your back against the locker,
head on a swivel."

445
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:45,827
"What?"

446
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,622
"Get you some Mace,
put it in a plastic bottle like this."

447
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,166
"Gush it at him. That's what I'd do."
"Gush it?"

448
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,922
I don't feel like my kids' private school
respects my level of celebrity.

449
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,717
I don't. I really don't.

450
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,762
I mean this. I swear to God, my plan…
I'm gonna be very honest.

451
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,682
It's my fucking household.
I'm not holding back.

452
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,269
They don't respect my level of celebrity.

453
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,689
I'm a very humble guy. [chuckles]

454
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,485
May not seem like it after that sentence,
but I am. I'm a very humble guy.

455
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,615
What's understood doesn't need to be said.
You know who I am. I know you know it.

456
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,867
Don't make me say who I am.

457
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,579
They put me in the position
to have to say who I am.

458
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:32,874
I go drop my kids off at school,
teachers come out, surround my car.

459
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,794
"Mr. Hart, we'd love
to talk to you for a second."

460
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,297
"The big fair is coming up."

461
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,841
"We do this fair
once a year at the school."

462
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,426
"We would love it

463
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,512
if you would be the greeter
at this year's fair."

464
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,893
[crowd laughs]

465
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,317
I gave her a lot of time
for her to say, "I'm bullshitting."

466
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,693
She never said it.

467
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,779
I said, "Are you fucking kidding me?"

468
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,281
"No, it's our biggest fair."

469
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,283
"We would love it
if you would be the greeter."

470
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:09,911
"We think you would make
an amazing greeter at this year's fair."

471
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,332
Before I go on with this joke,
I wanna make something clear.

472
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:16,376
First things first,
I have nothing against greeters.

473
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,172
Okay? I don't wanna tell this joke
and walk outside my house

474
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:23,091
and you're all there with signs
talking about "Cancel Kevin Hart

475
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,052
'cause he don't respect greeters."

476
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,888
"Cancel Kevin Hart
'cause he don't respect the greeters."

477
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,681
Greeters are amazing people.

478
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,310
The job is actually required. I get it.

479
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,646
I've actually been hit
with some amazing greetings in my time.

480
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,068
I went to Walmart, I got hit with
a greeting so fantastic one time…

481
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:45,030
I don't even know where he came from.
He just slid in my POV. [chuckles]

482
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,074
I walked in. He was like,
"Welcome to Walmart."

483
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,285
"You here to get you some stuff?"
I said, "What the fuck?"

484
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,662
"Where did you come from, man?" [chuckles]

485
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:56,208
"You better get some stuff.
We rolling back prices."

486
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,877
Then he moonwalked.
He just moonwalked out the way.

487
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,923
I said, "What the fuck just happened?"
"What just happened here?"

488
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:07,177
I was so blown away by the greeting,
not only did I go get me some stuff,

489
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,764
I broke my neck
looking for this guy on the way out.

490
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:15,143
I wanted him to see my stuff.
"Hey, come here, man!"

491
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:18,230
"Hey, come here.
I wanna show you my stuff."

492
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:23,485
He came over, I opened my bag.
He was like… "Ooh!"

493
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:31,743
He said, "Ooh!
You got you some good stuff."

494
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,832
Took out his highlighter, swiped
my receipt so people knew I didn't steal.

495
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,626
He said, "Make sure
you come back and see me again."

496
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,877
I said, "You gonna be here?"

497
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:43,380
He said, "If I'm not, who will?"
Moonwalks out the way again.

498
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,757
-I said, "What the fuck?"
-[crowd laughs and applauds]

499
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,593
"It's one of the best greetings
I've ever seen, man."

500
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,096
"Of course I'mma come back
and see you again."

501
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm not shitting on greeters. I'm just
saying I didn't have to go that route.

502
00:23:57,227 --> 00:24:00,105
I went around that to get to my success.

503
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,526
You don't come to me
and ask me to be the fucking greeter.

504
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,320
I had a number-one movie
in the box office at the time.

505
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,240
-I was on the side of fucking buses.
-[crowd applauding]

506
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,201
You don't ask me to be the greeter.

507
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,911
[crowd laughing]

508
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,997
There are parents
that got kids that go there

509
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,584
that are former actors and actresses
that you could have asked.

510
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,586
Carlton from the Fresh Prince, Alfonso?

511
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,255
That's your greeter. This right here.

512
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,258
That's what you want in front.
That's your greeter.

513
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,386
Terry Crews. He got kids that go there.

514
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,805
That's your greeter.
Pec-popping at the front.

515
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,225
[mimicking Terry Crews] "Hey…"

516
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,021
"Hey… Welcome to the fair.
Who want a ticket?"

517
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,816
What a combination.
Parents would've went crazy. "Whoa!

518
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,943
"What a school."

519
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,655
"I want tickets.
I'm gonna buy every ticket I can."

520
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,199
[mimics Crews] Hey…

521
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:55,911
Parents would be blown away.
These greeters are amazing.

522
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,789
My wife said what she normally says.

523
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,499
"Kevin, calm down."

524
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,337
"Get yourself together.
You getting older, more irritable,

525
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,673
and you don't want
that energy to rub off on your kids."

526
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:13,094
It's not gonna rub off on my goddamn kids.
I know it's not gonna rub off on my kids.

527
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,640
This pandemic gave me a chance
to spend a lot of time with my kids.

528
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,601
A lot of time with my kids.
For the first time, I realized

529
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,561
my kids are a little spoiled.

530
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,523
They're a little spoiled. But it's not
by choice, it's by circumstances.

531
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,610
I have good kids.
My kids are great kids. I gotta be honest.

532
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,488
I got very lucky. I got great kids.

533
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,616
But because of their circumstances,
they're a little spoiled.

534
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,703
For example, they've been flying private
since birth, they didn't ask for that.

535
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,247
They were born into that.

536
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,040
They only travel with me.

537
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,835
First time they traveled without me
was during this pandemic with my ex-wife.

538
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,214
Went back to Philadelphia
with their mom to go see their grandma.

539
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,840
My kids called me from the airport.

540
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:54,177
You would have thought
my kids were in Baghdad.

541
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,595
I've never seen…

542
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,015
a higher level of panic
in my fucking life.

543
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,393
Called me from the airport, "Dad!"

544
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,770
[whimpering] "What's happening?"

545
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:07,274
My daughter was like, "They're
taking my lotions and toothpaste."

546
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,692
"What am I supposed to do?"

547
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,238
"They're making me walk through metal…"

548
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,824
My son snatched the phone,
"What the fuck is going on, Dad?"

549
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,785
"They won't let me take my bags."

550
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,496
"They said I can't take
my backpacks, my pulleys, my duffys."

551
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,583
"I gotta put my games underneath.
How am I gonna play 'em, Dad?"

552
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,214
I told them both, "Relax. Stop it. Stop!"

553
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,300
"Both of you."

554
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,760
"It's called security."

555
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,805
"It's called TSA, okay?"

556
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,392
"This is called life with your mother."

557
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,185
"All right? There's a difference."

558
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,105
"There's a drop-off. It's all right."

559
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,149
"Things change."

560
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,443
"It's okay."

561
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,820
"You'll both be fine."

562
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,241
I overlooked some of the things I do
because I never thought twice about 'em.

563
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,119
Me and my kids go to
the amusement park, we do the whole park.

564
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,747
The whole fucking park,
man, in 30, 40 minutes.

565
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:08,376
How? Well, I call ahead.
There's a concierge they assign to me.

566
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,670
I get to the park,
concierge walks me and my family

567
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,965
up to the front of every single ride.
Done it for years.

568
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,386
Keep in mind, I explain to my kids,
"Listen, this is earned. It's not given."

569
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,430
"This doesn't just happen."

570
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:24,559
"Your father worked hard to be able to
walk to the front of these fucking lines."

571
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,937
"There's rules. You don't just
walk to the front of the line."

572
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,732
"Rule number one, as we are
walking to the front of the line,

573
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,778
you do not make eye contact with none
of these fucking people in this line."

574
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:35,904
"You hear me?"

575
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,865
"You keep your eyes straight ahead

576
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:43,536
and you don't fucking look left or right
until we get to the front of the line."

577
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,874
"These people are gonna say things.
They're gonna say a lot of mean things

578
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,209
about me, you."

579
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:50,919
"You just ignore 'em."

580
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,214
"Ignore 'em, because guess what?
We're in our car, headed home."

581
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,091
"We're never
gonna see these people again."

582
00:27:56,674 --> 00:28:00,261
"You know where these people
gonna be? Still in that fucking line."

583
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,263
"They're still gonna be in the line."

584
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,974
"And that's reality."

585
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,521
My kids processed that,
they understood it.

586
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,815
For years, this is how we operated.

587
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,068
They called me from the amusement park.

588
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,487
They were with their cousins,
they FaceTimed me.

589
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:21,449
I answer their FaceTime.
I could tell that they were weak.

590
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,327
Malnourished, they hadn't eaten
in hours, I could tell.

591
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,871
They had the white shit
in the corner of their mouths.

592
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,956
[chuckles]

593
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,541
They could barely stand.

594
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:32,001
[mimics yelling]

595
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,422
"Dad!"

596
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,760
"We've been in line for hours,
we haven't rode anything."

597
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,889
"We got the fast pass,
but it's not fast at all."

598
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:51,104
"Can you call somebody?
Can you do something?"

599
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,605
I said, "Who are you with?"

600
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,399
"Our cousins."

601
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,151
"Is your mother there?" "Yes."

602
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,069
"Put your mom on the phone,
let me talk to your mom."

603
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,239
Got their mom on the phone.
She said, "Hey, what's up?" "Hey."

604
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,949
"Checkmate, bitch." I hung up the phone.

605
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,993
[crowd laughing]

606
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:05,994
I was quick.

607
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,498
I haven't went over
these jokes with my ex-wife yet,

608
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,958
I wanna let you guys know.

609
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:16,004
These jokes are gonna come with
a price tag attached to 'em.

610
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,048
Probably have to buy her
a Tesla truck or something.

611
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:22,093
Something's gotta happen.
It's just a good fucking joke.

612
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,596
Those are two good jokes,
I can't get rid of 'em.

613
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:25,513
[all applauding]

614
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,849
I thought about
those jokes for a long time.

615
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:31,811
I gotta let 'em fly.
It's worth the consequence.

616
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,399
I'll send her a couple of text messages
after this tape and see how she feels.

617
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,026
[Kevin chuckling]

618
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,031
My wife says the same thing
all the time, "Kevin, you getting older."

619
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,283
"Getting angry, irritable."

620
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:48,953
I'm here to tell you I am getting older.
Forty-one now, guys.

621
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,332
-[crowd cheering and applauding]
-I know, right?

622
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,584
Where does time go?

623
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,377
I was just 22 years old, man.

624
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,380
You do not realize how fast time flies.

625
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,424
Look back, all those
comedy specials on the wall,

626
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,259
that's a timeline of my fucking life.

627
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,887
That's damn near 16 years of comedy, man.

628
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,307
Sixteen fucking years
of comedy, like, it's insane.

629
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,308
[crowd applauding]

630
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,143
Forty-one.

631
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:13,853
What happened?

632
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,189
Shit changes at the age of 40.

633
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,858
You hear about it,
but you don't believe it, things change.

634
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:22,070
I'm here to tell you, shit does change.

635
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,280
Biggest change for me,
after the age of 40,

636
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,074
the balls dropped. I got some length.

637
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:29,702
Got some fucking length
on my balls. I didn't ask for it.

638
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,789
Just happened.
I didn't even know. I was in the kitchen.

639
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,542
Bent over, wife said, "Why you
got dice in your back pocket?"

640
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,169
"I ain't got no fucking dice
in my back pocket."

641
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:42,173
Touched my back pocket,
"Goddamn, those are my fucking balls."

642
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:46,386
"How did my balls get in my back pocket?
What just happened to me?"

643
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,887
"How long was I asleep?"

644
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,933
"Who stretched me out while I was asleep?"

645
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,314
The biggest thing for me
is how content I am at this age, man.

646
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,691
I am okay.

647
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,653
I'm very serious, man.
I am okay. I don't need to do much.

648
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,530
I love being in the fucking house.

649
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,157
I actually built the house.

650
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,743
Me and my wife built the house,
that's where we wanted to stay.

651
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,329
We wanted to stay in this fucking house.

652
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,125
Let's build our dream house
to stay in it, not to leave it.

653
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,503
Women got a problem with doing this thing
called sitting the fuck down.

654
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:25,967
It's very difficult
for women to sit the fuck down.

655
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,596
Sit the fuck down.

656
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,806
That's a task for women.

657
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:35,184
A woman's favorite line,
"Let's go do some stuff."

658
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,854
"What stuff?" "Mmm-mmm. Something."

659
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,566
"The fuck are you saying?" "Something."

660
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,192
[Kevin chuckles]

661
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,572
A bunch of men…
There's a bunch of men rejoicing. "Yeah!"

662
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,075
"Something, I don't know. Something."

663
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,164
You know what my wife's
biggest problem is? Chasing her past.

664
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,207
Trying to redo
what she did when she was younger.

665
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,669
Ladies, I'm here to give you
a personal message. It's okay to get old.

666
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,339
There's nothing wrong with getting old.

667
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,506
[crowd applauding]

668
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,175
There's nothing wrong with it.

669
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,928
Stop fighting old age.

670
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,806
The beauty of getting older
is that you get to look back and realize

671
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:17,352
all the dope shit that you overcame
and that you did when you were younger.

672
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,645
That's dope.

673
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,481
Stop trying to run from that.

674
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,692
Stop trying to redo that. It's over.

675
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,611
It's fucking over.

676
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,906
She told me the other day,
"We should go out tonight."

677
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,407
"We should get fucked up."

678
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,408
[chuckles]

679
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,119
I said, "Absolutely not. No."

680
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,497
"Why would I do that? No."

681
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,707
"It hurts. It fucking hurts now."

682
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,628
Take a shot, it gets stuck in my chest
for three to five fucking minutes.

683
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,715
My left side shut down,
I get the shaking and shit.

684
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,177
I gotta fart or shit. I don't know,
it's one of 'em, something's happening.

685
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,137
Making dumbass faces.

686
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,099
I describe this to my wife
in great detail.

687
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,434
You know what her answer was?

688
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,603
"You don't never wanna have fun with me."

689
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,232
I said, "Bitch,
I just described a stroke to you."

690
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,525
"That's a stroke."

691
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,028
"That's a legal stroke.
I'm shutting down."

692
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:13,866
"You don't wanna have fun with me.
You don't ever want to do stuff."

693
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,663
After the age 40, you know what,
you lose a high level of care.

694
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,623
I don't really give a fuck.

695
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,252
My wife wanna go out, I don't.
"You go. I don't give a fuck."

696
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,505
"I'm serious.
I don't give a fuck what you do."

697
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,134
That's not in a malicious or angry way.
I'm serious. I don't give a fuck. Go!

698
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,011
Have a good time. Go!"

699
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,306
Ladies, you don't know how
to not give a fuck, that's your problem.

700
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:41,436
If you guys could match
a man's not-give-a-fuck energy,

701
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,563
oh, my God, the world
would be a better place.

702
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,400
It'd be a better place.
But you don't know how to not give a fuck.

703
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,902
You're always
searching for a fuck 'cause you just…

704
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:53,656
You can't. You don't process it.
You can't figure it out.

705
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,869
I'mma tell you your problem,
ladies, and I want you to listen closely.

706
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,705
Here's what makes a woman really mad.

707
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:05,334
You guys get upset if a man
does not give you the reaction

708
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:08,296
that you feel that you would give him.

709
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,173
I'mma say it again.

710
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:17,013
Ladies, you get upset
if a man does not give you the reaction

711
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,683
that you feel that you would give him.

712
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:25,271
Hence why you're always
searching for a give-a-fuck.

713
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,483
'Cause on the other side,
you're like, "I would give a fuck."

714
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,400
[woman] Yeah.

715
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,652
-"So you should give a fuck."
-[woman] Yeah.

716
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,696
That's why you search for give-a-fucks.

717
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,532
My wife constantly search for 'em.

718
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,451
She wants to go out. "Go out."

719
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,829
She can't just leave.
"All right, babe, I'm going out."

720
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,789
"Cool."

721
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:45,917
"Me and the girls."

722
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,834
"Got it."

723
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,088
"We probably getting fucked up tonight."

724
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,130
"Do you."

725
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,051
"I don't know what time we coming back."

726
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,428
"I'll be asleep either way, it's fine."

727
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:01,641
She's searching for give-a-fucks.
There are no give-a-fucks!

728
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:06,145
"Go!" I'm excited for you to leave
so I can eat chips off my belly button.

729
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,271
I don't give a fuck.

730
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:08,648
"Go!"

731
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,276
They can't do it.

732
00:35:13,402 --> 00:35:14,987
Hence you want the same from men.

733
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,739
You don't understand, first and foremost,

734
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,617
stop expecting us to be
as bright and brilliant as you.

735
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,204
If a man goes out and he's over
40 years old, I'm here to tell you,

736
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,997
there is no plan attached to that.

737
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,251
There is no fucking agenda.
There's no schedule.

738
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:31,379
Stop asking questions
because we don't have the answers.

739
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,549
Granted, I know some insecurities
are brought on because of men

740
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,260
and the things that they did
in the past… I'm guilty of it…

741
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,345
but after the age of 40, it goes away.

742
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,849
It goes away. We don't give a fuck
about shit. We don't care.

743
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,059
Stop looking for shit.

744
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,271
I told her… The one time
I said I was going out.

745
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,565
"Babe, I'm going out." "Where you going?"

746
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:51,858
"I don't even know yet."

747
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:53,818
"Who going with you?"

748
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:55,444
"Whoever come I guess, I don't know."

749
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,281
"What y'all gonna do?"

750
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,367
"I'm trying to figure it out now.
I don't know what we're doing."

751
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:02,368
"Y'all gonna eat?"

752
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,537
"I hope so, I'm hungry. I haven't eaten."

753
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,123
"What time you back?"
"Whatever time we done."

754
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,833
"What the fuck is going on here?"

755
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,253
"Am I getting graded? What is this?
I don't have the answers!"

756
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:15,381
"I'm failing miserably.
Stop asking me questions."

757
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,675
I can't fuckin' deal with it.

758
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,887
There's a high level
of insecurity sometimes

759
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,306
that's not worth you having, ladies.

760
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,600
We got into an argument one time.

761
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,185
Got into a fucking argument.

762
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,146
Two reasons.
First, she asked me this big question.

763
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,772
I had to explain that I didn't know.

764
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:34,192
Another secret, ladies.
After men say, "We going out,"

765
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,821
we actually meet in the parking lot and
try to figure out what the fuck we doing.

766
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,199
We actually have
another meeting ourselves.

767
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:44,619
"What's the plan?" "I thought you had it."
"I don't, I thought you did."

768
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,955
"Nobody got a fuckin' plan? I'm out.
I'm not staying here doing this shit."

769
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,499
I go home, go to sleep.
I got back home early.

770
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,543
"You back early
'cause you was with a bitch."

771
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,586
"No, I wasn't!"

772
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,256
"I was in a parking lot at Home Depot
for 45 minutes…

773
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,593
talking about absolutely nothing,
which is why I came home."

774
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,888
I don't like fuckin' arguing.

775
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,350
I'm at an age where I don't argue,
I just leave.

776
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,559
That's my new move.

777
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,519
"You argue with yourself. I'll be back."

778
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,563
[chuckles] "I'll be back."

779
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,982
"Hopefully when I come back,
you ain't got no energy."

780
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,692
That's my fuckin' move.

781
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,237
We argued in the morning and I left.
It was 7:00 a.m.

782
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,529
She called me, I'm in the car.

783
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:23,407
She was like, "You probably
getting your dick sucked."

784
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,867
At 7:00 a.m.?

785
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:29,622
What bitch is that ambitious
that's out here at 7:00 a.m…

786
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,082
sucking dick?

787
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,502
What type of daywalker do you think
I'm dealing with? Jesus Christ!

788
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,965
A 7:00 a.m. dicksucker on the loose,
that's got you worried?

789
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,092
What are you readin'?

790
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:45,513
What's the blog that told y'all to worry
about the dicksucker at 7:00 a.m.?

791
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,723
"Watch your man, ladies!"

792
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,310
"Since 7:00 a.m.,
dicksucker on the prowl!"

793
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:52,853
"Thanks, girl."

794
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:55,773
"I saw it on my…" [chuckling]

795
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,317
"I saw it on my security camera."

796
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,528
"Outside looking for dicks."

797
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,738
Came down… [laughing]

798
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:07,660
"I saw her looking for dicks
on my security camera."

799
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,663
"Somewhere out there looking for dicks."

800
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,749
Shit that I deal with is unreal.

801
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,130
All my wife's insecurities dropped down
after she read my group chat.

802
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,967
Ladies, if you got a man
over 40 years old in this room,

803
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,511
I challenge you to check his phone
and read his group chat.

804
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:26,929
Do it!

805
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,348
Over 40? You should do it.

806
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:30,933
Under 40?

807
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,852
I don't recommend it, you gambling.

808
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,812
You fuckin' gambling.

809
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,982
Forty and above? Go, read it!

810
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:43,321
You will never read a more inconsistent
and unfocused conversation in your life.

811
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,741
All my group chat conversations
start off the same.

812
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,659
They all start off great.

813
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,619
"Yo!"

814
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,789
"You see that picture of Rihanna's ass?"

815
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:54,957
"Goddamn."

816
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,083
"Shit!"

817
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,209
"Fuck!"

818
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,294
"I saw it."

819
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,713
Random question flies in the chat.

820
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,799
"If you run out of butter,
what else can I put in the pan?"

821
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,717
"What?"

822
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:07,970
"I ain't got no butter, man."

823
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,472
"What else can I use?"

824
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:10,765
"How'd you run out of butter?"

825
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,350
"I don't know, but it's gone."

826
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,352
Another statement flies in.

827
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,937
"I can't even eat butter.
It makes my gout act up."

828
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,855
"Gout?"

829
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,025
"When you get gout?" "I been had gout."

830
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,485
"I didn't know you had gout."

831
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,403
"I told y'all I had gout."

832
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,322
Another statement flies in the chat.

833
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,823
"What the fuck is gout?"

834
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,828
A picture from WebMD hit the chat. Pow!

835
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,664
Description of gout
and what the fuck it can do.

836
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,458
"Goddamn, you got that?"

837
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,711
Then the chat goes silent for five days.

838
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,380
Don't nobody saying shit.

839
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,758
Forty and up, the chat just die.

840
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,093
Nobody ends it.

841
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,054
Day six, they pick up
right where they left off.

842
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,931
"What else make your gout act up?"

843
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,353
My friend Joey don't know
how to use emojis.

844
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,773
That's how she thought
she had somethin' one time.

845
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:03,692
You know, Joey's the older one,
Joey's the one with gout.

846
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,903
We tease him all the time.

847
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:06,987
"You gout-having bitch."

848
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:07,947
We just tease him.

849
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,532
He was getting mad in the chat.

850
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,450
"I'm tired of y'all
teasin' me all the time."

851
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,869
"Y'all just mad I'm doing
the right thing with my life."

852
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:14,995
"I'm getting healthy."

853
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,832
"In fact, I'm 'bout to go get me
a bunch of these right now."

854
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,709
He put five eggplants back-to-back.

855
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,420
Then he put… [chuckles]

856
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,297
Then he put the tongue emoji
with the splash.

857
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,634
I said, "What the fuck…
are you talking about, Joey?"

858
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,803
"What are you talking about right now?"

859
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,848
"You just said you're about to go
take five dicks to the face…

860
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:34,890
[chuckles]

861
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,184
and get them off.
That's what you just said."

862
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,644
"No, I didn't say that!"

863
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,770
"Yes, you did."

864
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,481
"Five eggplants, tongue, splash."

865
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,150
"You said you're taking it to the face,

866
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,652
finishing 'em off,
that's what you just said."

867
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,242
Fuckin' Joey.

868
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,620
Older you get, the more
direct and honest you get.

869
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:01,834
Me and my wife are at a very direct
and honest space in our relationship.

870
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,294
Very honest.

871
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,879
Very honest, man.

872
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,630
My wife told me the other day,

873
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,216
"Honey, your sex is no longer
what it used to be."

874
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,051
To my fuckin' face!

875
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,637
Ain't this a bitch?

876
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,141
We're in my home, I got no problem
being honest with y'all.

877
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,559
To my fuckin' face.

878
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,687
Told me my sex is falling off.

879
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,106
Know what my response was?

880
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,734
"Happens." That's what I said.

881
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,569
"Happens."

882
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,321
I don't give a shit.

883
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,908
Fucking 41, I don't got time
to be fuckin' all day.

884
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,659
I'm tired. I'm tired.

885
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,038
I don't believe that you can be successful
and have good dick.

886
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,623
I said it. That's how I feel.

887
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:45,002
That's how I fuckin' feel.
I'm not taking it back. I said it.

888
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,423
I don't believe that you can be successful
and have good dick.

889
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,093
I told her, "Gotta pick one.
You want this life or good dick?"

890
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,221
"I'm not gonna do both. Not doing both."

891
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,057
"I'm not giving you both. Pick one."

892
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,685
When I had good dick,
I was broke, I had nothing.

893
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,565
I was out here fucking for transportation
when I had good dick.

894
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,400
Fuckin' for tokens.

895
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,446
Sick of walking. I need
to put down some good dick,

896
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,657
get in somebody's car around here.

897
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,744
It was cold in Philadelphia.
You don't know my life. Stop judging me.

898
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,708
But because you're married,
you gotta fuckin' compromise.

899
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,502
Gotta meet you halfway.

900
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,214
I told her, "You feel like
I need to do better sexually?"

901
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,298
"Pick a date."

902
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,342
"Pick a date."

903
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,845
On that date, I'm required
to give out some good dick.

904
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:43,852
You pick a date, on that date,
I'm required to give out some good dick.

905
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,647
She picked the eighth of every month.

906
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,357
"All right.

907
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,485
"You better buckle the fuck up."

908
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:57,491
"I'm 'bout to drop some dick
on your ass like you never had."

909
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:01,954
"To thump your ass right now.
That's exactly what I'mma do."

910
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,374
It's all fun and games until the week of.

911
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,835
You get nervous as shit, man. [chuckles]

912
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,297
My friends saw it on my face, "You good?"

913
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,841
"No, I ain't good.
I gotta fuck in five days, man."

914
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,093
Gotta fuck her on the eighth.

915
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,346
I was out here drinking pineapple juice,
eating celery. I don't…

916
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,849
I don't know what the fuck
is happening to me.

917
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,810
Sweatin'. "Damn, man,
I gotta fuck in three days!"

918
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:25,894
Countdown.

919
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:28,647
Felt like I had the NBA Finals
coming up or some shit, huh?

920
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,775
Icing my legs,
I didn't know what was happening.

921
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,612
The eighth came up, I did a good job.

922
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,114
-Gave out a batch of some good dick.
-[scattered applause]

923
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,158
Thank you for the applause,
I appreciate it.

924
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,828
Very sad that you felt like
you had to clap there, but I'll take it.

925
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,539
"Thank God, Kevin. Jesus!"

926
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,876
My honesty backfired over there.

927
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,711
Ooh! Oh.

928
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,756
Gave out some good dick on the eighth.

929
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:59,511
In true woman fashion, on the ninth,
she tried to get some more.

930
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,015
It's not our agreement.
That's not the deal we made.

931
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,975
I said one date.

932
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,686
Every other day
could be trashy dick or not.

933
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,439
You don't fuckin' expect
the same thing again.

934
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,152
After my fuckin' bedtime,
she come in 8:30 p.m., drunk as shit.

935
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,820
It's late.

936
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,238
[all laugh]

937
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,324
Trying to wake me up, "Get up."

938
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,326
"Trying to get some dick."

939
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,371
"Trying to get more of that eighth dick."

940
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,580
That's what she said.

941
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,083
[all laugh]

942
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:33,587
"I want some more of that eighth dick.
Let me get some of that eighth dick."

943
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,674
I snap, "Get the fuck off me,
get your hands off of me."

944
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:39,843
"Coming here this late at night
waking me up."

945
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,136
"Waking the dog up."

946
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,057
Older you get, you care more
about the animals than anything else.

947
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,018
"The dog ain't had a good night's sleep
in the last two weeks,

948
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,728
you come in here all loud?"

949
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,564
"Pissed off,
I'm very pissed off right now."

950
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,400
Me and the dog went downstairs, slept.

951
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,819
Slept in the guest fucking room.
"I'm not gonna stay with you

952
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,945
and your selfishness

953
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:01,031
'cause you want some more
of that eighth dick."

954
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,409
"You just lost a month
is what you just did."

955
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:07,454
Took the next eighth off the contract
is what I did.

956
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,794
You know, honestly, what makes me laugh?
Hearing other people talk about sex.

957
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,962
That's enough for me.

958
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,549
Hearing other people talk about sex
is the funniest shit in the world.

959
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,302
Funniest people to listen to
talk about sex is my nephews.

960
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:24,304
My nephews are 21, 22 years old.

961
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,558
It's the funniest shit
that you'll ever hear, man.

962
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,562
Funniest shit you'll ever hear,
but they don't offer the information,

963
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,063
you gotta bait it out of them.

964
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,358
You gotta set a trap,
see if they fall for it.

965
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,152
I set the trap, they fall in every time.

966
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,445
I just come in the room, hot.

967
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,363
"Y'all ain't fuckin' yet."

968
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,615
They take the bait every time.

969
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,825
"Who ain't fuckin'?"

970
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,996
Every time. "Who ain't fuckin'?"

971
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,875
"I know you ain't sayin' me.
I know you ain't sayin' I ain't fuckin'."

972
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,418
"I'm fuckin'!"

973
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,837
"I know you ain't sayin' me."

974
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,714
"Go ahead, Unc."

975
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,174
"You ain't fuckin', bitch."

976
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,759
"I know your young ass ain't fuckin'."

977
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,219
"I'm fuckin', Unc."

978
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,972
"Tell me what you doing."
"No, I ain't telling you."

979
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,933
"'Cause if I tell you,
you'll put it in your comedy show."

980
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,560
"I ain't talking about you, shut up."

981
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,271
"What would I put you
in my comedy show for?"

982
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,856
"I got jokes, I don't need you."

983
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,318
"What you doing? Give me
the nastiest thing that you've done."

984
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,361
"No judging?" "No judging."

985
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,197
"Fuck I'mma judge you for?"

986
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:24,907
"All right."

987
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,451
"Nastiest thing I've done…"

988
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,579
"Went to the movies with this girl."

989
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:35,167
"We go to the movies, she tell me
to get a large bucket of popcorn."

990
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:38,879
"I get the bucket of popcorn, I sit down,
she cut a hole in the bottom,

991
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,049
told me put my dick through the hole,
gave me a butter beat-off."

992
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,885
I said, "What the fuck?"

993
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,180
Listen, I caught myself,
I had to act like I knew what it was.

994
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:51,767
Ha-ha! Ah.

995
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,686
"A butter beat-off."

996
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,523
"I know that's right."

997
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,192
"A butter beat-off."

998
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,447
You know you older
'cause you ask the wrong questions.

999
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:08,367
"Fuck y'all get a large for?
Why you waste all that popcorn?"

1000
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,035
"You should've just got the small."

1001
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,913
"It's a $12, $14 difference, ain't it?
Why you get that?"

1002
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,791
"The butter don't get in your hole?"

1003
00:47:15,874 --> 00:47:17,876
"That sound like an infection
waiting to happen."

1004
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,879
"It's how you catch the VID.
You gonna get the VID."

1005
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:25,592
"Get the 'VID-19 doing that shit,
putting the butter in your hole."

1006
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,678
"You don't want the butter in your hole."

1007
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,306
I ran home and told my wife.

1008
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,808
"Ain't gonna believe this shit."

1009
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:37,729
"Terrence told me these kids out here
giving each other butter beat-offs."

1010
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,023
She said, "They still doing that?"

1011
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,193
I said, "What the fuck is happening here?"

1012
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:44,778
"Who are you?"

1013
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,032
I don't even wanna know no more.
You just stop right there.

1014
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:52,286
My kids better not be doing it,
I know that much.

1015
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,289
If I find out my kids are doing it,
I'll have a goddamn fit.

1016
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:58,709
You can't just ask your kids, though.
You gotta, once again…

1017
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,836
You gotta set the trap,
see if they step in it.

1018
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,548
We at dinner, eating a good dinner
at the house, nice dinner.

1019
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,427
I throw the question out to my wife,
"We should go to the movies."

1020
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,178
"Maybe you can give a butter beat-off."

1021
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:13,223
I look right at my fuckin' daughter.
Right at my daughter.

1022
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,601
Staring at her ass.

1023
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:19,730
She didn't budge. She was cool as a fan,
eating her food and shit.

1024
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:22,232
I've never been more proud as a father.
Thank you, God.

1025
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,027
Thank you, God,
she don't even know what it is.

1026
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,194
Thank you, God.

1027
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,489
Turn this way,
my son was like, "Oh, yeah."

1028
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:30,907
[crowd laughing]

1029
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,744
He said, "Yeah!" [chuckles]

1030
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,204
"You better get the large, Dad."

1031
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:40,042
"You don't want that butter in the hole,
you'll catch the 'VID!"

1032
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,669
"Again. You don't want it twice."

1033
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,088
[chuckles]

1034
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:48,842
"You don't want back-to-back
cases of the 'VID, Dad."

1035
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:54,222
My wife actually beat me up,
made me take her on a date.

1036
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:55,932
Took her to a dinner party.

1037
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,895
I'm not name-dropping, but this joke
doesn't make sense unless I…

1038
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:00,854
drop the name.

1039
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,774
I went to Seinfeld's house
for a dinner party.

1040
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,984
Some of the best food I've ever had.

1041
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,778
Food was fuckin' amazing, man.

1042
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,405
At the end of the dinner party,
Seinfeld came walking out.

1043
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,574
He was like, [imitates Seinfeld]
"Nobody go anywhere."

1044
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:16,203
"You guys are in for a treat. Tonight…

1045
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,665
we're gonna have some brick-oven pizza."

1046
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,416
[in normal voice] Everybody went crazy.

1047
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,169
"What? Oh, my God! Brick-oven pizza?"

1048
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,630
"What?"

1049
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,760
One lady was like,
"How many cheeses, Jerry?"

1050
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,974
Jerry's like, "Seven different cheeses."
"Seven different cheeses."

1051
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,519
People went crazy.

1052
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:44,481
By the way, all these people were white.
These are all fuckin' white people.

1053
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,734
They start chanting, "BOP!"

1054
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,736
The fuck is "BOP," man?

1055
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,905
[chanting] "BOP!"

1056
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,699
What the fuck is "BOP"?

1057
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,617
White woman leans over the table,

1058
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:57,953
she was like,
"It's short for brick-oven pizza."

1059
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,621
I was like, "Oh, shit."

1060
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,581
"Oh, shit."

1061
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,292
"Oh, okay, I get it."

1062
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:09,715
Seinfeld has some Italian men walk out.
They had pizza-like garb on.

1063
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,426
They start passing out the pizza
saying Italian shit…

1064
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,302
[imitating Italian accent]

1065
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,138
I don't know Italian.

1066
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,514
[imitating Italian accent]

1067
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,767
It just dawned on me, as I told that joke,

1068
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,145
what I'm doing is racist right now.
I apologize.

1069
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:25,772
[imitating Italian accent]

1070
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,026
People were eating the pizza, going crazy.

1071
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,612
"Oh, my God. I taste the cheeses, Jerry."

1072
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,532
"I taste the cheeses."

1073
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,326
They brought me my pizza. I took a bite.

1074
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,745
I couldn't fucking believe it.

1075
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,789
Best pizza I've ever had in my life.

1076
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,541
Best fucking pizza I've ever had.

1077
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,461
It had some type of lettuce on it.
I've never tasted this shit.

1078
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:49,880
Told my wife,
"It's got some type of lettuce on it."

1079
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,006
"Wait till you taste it."

1080
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:54,634
This white woman leaned over again,
she was like, "It's arugula."

1081
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,136
"What?"

1082
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,512
"It's arugula."

1083
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:58,764
"Oh, shit."

1084
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:02,434
I took another bite. I got caught up.
"BOP, BOP, BOP."

1085
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,270
"BOP, BOP…" [chuckles]

1086
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:08,190
What an amazing night.

1087
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,359
Fucking amazing night,
from start to finish, man.

1088
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:13,695
In the car, I was pissed.

1089
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,198
I was pissed, you know why?

1090
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:18,200
Because I wanted what Seinfeld had.

1091
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,077
I wanted that fucking moment, man.

1092
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,331
Seinfeld was known as
the brick-oven-pizza guy.

1093
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:27,459
He was known for something else
outside of his fame.

1094
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,794
I wanted that.

1095
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,004
What really pissed me off

1096
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:33,965
was that the same people who
built Seinfeld's house built my house.

1097
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,010
Not once was I offered the option
of getting a brick pizza oven

1098
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,762
at my goddamn house.

1099
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,806
This was racism at the highest level.

1100
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,767
It's fucking racist.

1101
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,353
The next morning comes,
I call the contractors.

1102
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:49,231
I come in hot, "You racist fucks!"

1103
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:54,361
"For you guys to offer Seinfeld
the option of getting a brick pizza oven

1104
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,823
and not even bringing it up to me
shows just how racist you are."

1105
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,700
"You better make it right
or it's gonna get worse for you."

1106
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,035
I hang up the phone. Pow!

1107
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,788
They call back,
"What are you talking about?"

1108
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,123
"You know what I'm talking about.
Black lives matter."

1109
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:08,625
Hung up again. Pow.

1110
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,338
Within a day, they're at my house.

1111
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,841
Had a blueprint
of what my pizza oven can look like.

1112
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,384
Within a week,

1113
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,886
I had a brick pizza oven
in the back of my house.

1114
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,055
Once again, I wanted what Seinfeld had.

1115
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,182
I invited all my friends over.

1116
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,143
I'm gonna have a dinner party,
just like Seinfeld did.

1117
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,603
All my friends finish eating.

1118
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:32,232
I come out at the end of dinner
the same way Seinfeld did.

1119
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,485
"All right."

1120
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,535
"Nobody go anywhere

1121
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:47,956
because you guys
are in for a treat tonight."

1122
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,792
"We're gonna have
some brick-oven pizza tonight."

1123
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,461
You hear murmurs around the room.

1124
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:56,798
"Fuck is he talking about?
I ain't eating no pizza off no brick."

1125
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,926
Everybody at my party is Black.
These are all Black people.

1126
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,470
"You better order Domino's.
I'm not eating that shit."

1127
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,848
[Kevin chuckles]

1128
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:07,142
I said,
"Now, I know what you're thinking."

1129
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,520
"How many cheeses?"

1130
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,858
"Seven different cheeses."

1131
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:20,155
More murmurs. "I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm not eating all that fucking cheese."

1132
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:23,241
"Everyone knows you only put
that much cheese on macaroni."

1133
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,493
"I'm not gonna eat that.
What's his problem?"

1134
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,954
I said, "Everybody get up.
Let's go outside

1135
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,915
'cause that's where
the brick-oven pizza is."

1136
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,501
More murmurs. "It's cold as shit outside.
I'm not going outside."

1137
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:35,629
Black people got a response
for every fucking thing.

1138
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,006
"I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not going outside."

1139
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,884
I said, "Come on, everybody,
say it with me,

1140
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,887
[chanting] 'BOP, BOP, BOP.'"

1141
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,848
My friend Jamal stood up in the back,

1142
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,644
"Oh, if you got some BOP outside,
I'm going."

1143
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,188
Na'im said, "What the fuck is BOP?"

1144
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,441
He said, "Man, he got some
big old pussy out there. I'm goin'."

1145
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,402
I said, "No, Jamal,
ain't no big old pussy out there."

1146
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,404
"Yes, it is. That's what BOP is."

1147
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,281
"No, it's not."
"Yes, it is. I was with you."

1148
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,241
"We was in Atlanta, that big bitch said,

1149
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,910
'Wanna see my BOP?'"
"What's that?"

1150
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,162
"And she was like, 'Big old pussy.'"

1151
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:10,956
"And me and you start tipping her."

1152
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,542
"I ain't got no ones
but I want to see it again."

1153
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,253
Everybody left.

1154
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,673
I never got my moment.

1155
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,425
I did not get my moment.

1156
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,761
Keep in mind, I wanted that.

1157
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:28,098
I wanna be known for something
outside my fucking fame, man.

1158
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,683
I wanted be known as Kevin Hart,

1159
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:32,102
the brick-oven-pizza guy,
and the moment was gone.

1160
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,354
I had to find a new hobby.

1161
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,399
Searched hard for a new hobby, too.

1162
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,275
I was road biking for a minute.

1163
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,403
Getting miles in on the bike.

1164
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,823
I stopped, though.
The reason why I stopped,

1165
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,659
I didn't like the way my dick looked
in the outfit. True story.

1166
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,828
Looked like I had a clit,
I didn't like it.

1167
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,206
'Tween that and the long balls,
it was a bad combination.

1168
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,708
Shit just didn't look right.

1169
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,544
When you stop at a light,
you gotta click out.

1170
00:54:58,294 --> 00:54:59,504
[chuckles]

1171
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,257
You gotta snap out, like,
"Hey, what's up?"

1172
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,259
Cars were slowing down.

1173
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:07,345
"Fuck you slowing down for, man?
Get out here! Stop looking."

1174
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,055
This lady slowed down. It was 7 a.m.

1175
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,391
I said, "You get outta here.
I know what you want."

1176
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,893
"Daywalker. Get your ass out of here."

1177
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:17,897
"Ain't no dicks out here for you, lady.
Get out of here, daywalker."

1178
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,066
"Get out of here."

1179
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,318
I started boxing.

1180
00:55:22,402 --> 00:55:24,279
Boxing became a hobby.

1181
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,864
I started boxing because I felt like

1182
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,867
it was something
I could get better at every day.

1183
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,618
Every day, I can get good.

1184
00:55:30,702 --> 00:55:32,203
It's me against me.

1185
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,538
Went and found a trainer.

1186
00:55:33,621 --> 00:55:36,916
The guy had amazing talent
underneath his belt.

1187
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,626
Golden Glove fighters,

1188
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:42,047
Junior Olympics… I mean,
there's so much, lightweight champions.

1189
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,967
I said, "I know you're not working now,
but I'll pay you good money to train me."

1190
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,928
He said, "If you take me on,
I'll make you the best fighter ever."

1191
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,430
I said, "That's too much."

1192
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:53,683
"I don't want that.
I just want to get good."

1193
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,061
He said, "Done." He became my trainer.

1194
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,605
Gotta be honest with you.
He was fucking good.

1195
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,856
Made me good.

1196
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:02,650
Told me shit I thought I would never hear.

1197
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,862
Compared me to boxers I've never heard of,
but it still was a compliment.

1198
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:10,533
Told me I reminded him
of a fighter named Lefty Lou Earl.

1199
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,953
He's like, "Kevin, do you know
who that is?" I said, "No, I do not."

1200
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,872
He said, "I'mma bring you a tape."

1201
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,207
"You got a VCR?"

1202
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,917
"No, I do not."

1203
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,003
Then he made me laugh
when I told him I didn't have one.

1204
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,129
He was like… [grunts]

1205
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,050
Like I was in the wrong year.

1206
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:29,177
"Can't believe
you don't have a VCR. Goddamn."

1207
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:31,846
"Why do you still have a VCR, sir?"

1208
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,557
Told me I have
one of the best jabs he's ever seen.

1209
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,977
He said, "Your jab reminds me
of lightning coming from your shoulders."

1210
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:41,356
"Lightning coming from
your fucking shoulders."

1211
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,192
He said, "You thought about fighting?"
I said, "No."

1212
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:47,028
"What about sparring?"
I said, "No, but I would."

1213
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:49,989
"That's all I need to hear.
Tomorrow. 6 a.m. I'll set you up."

1214
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,867
"You need to see how good you are."

1215
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,537
6 a.m., I come to the gym.

1216
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,413
He got a guy there, my height, my build.

1217
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:01,376
Got my head gear,
my codpiece, my mouthpiece.

1218
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:05,380
Puts it all on me. Starts putting Vaseline
all on my face and my headgear.

1219
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,633
I said, "What's this for?"
He said, "So the punches slide off."

1220
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,970
[crowd laughs]

1221
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,347
"Well, we never talked… Okay."

1222
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,766
"We didn't discuss that, but all right."

1223
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:19,978
"Okay. If that's what it's gonna do,
then that's what it's gonna do."

1224
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,063
He's done putting Vaseline on.
Walks out the ring.

1225
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,857
I said, "Wait, you didn't do him yet."

1226
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,775
He said, "He's okay. He don't need it."

1227
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:29,070
"Huh. All right."

1228
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:32,532
That's weird. Okay, whatever.

1229
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,242
I'm gonna go with the flow.

1230
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,786
He said, "We're gonna do three
three-minute rounds."

1231
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,413
"Nobody's here to hurt anybody."

1232
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:40,415
"Have a good time. Keep it loose."

1233
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,542
He yells out, "Take it easy on him."

1234
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:45,962
I assume he's talking to me.
Gotta be talking to me.

1235
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,214
I yelled back, "Gotcha, coach."

1236
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,009
Put a confident laugh behind it. "Ha, ha!"

1237
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:55,054
We get to our corners. The bell rings.
Ding.

1238
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,348
I come out.
I want him to see that I could fight.

1239
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,809
You could tell I can fight
by the way I hold my shoulders.

1240
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,227
Look how I'm moving. Hmm?

1241
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,770
My feet are spaced apart.

1242
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:05,356
Look at my foot move.
Look how I'm moving, bitch.

1243
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,192
This ain't gonna be no cakewalk. Mmm-hmm.

1244
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:10,737
Yeah, you see it. He flatfooted.

1245
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:11,863
Oh!

1246
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:15,450
He's not even on the balls of his foot.
I'm gonna whoop his ass.

1247
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:18,870
I'm getting more confidence
as I move around.

1248
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:22,415
My coach says, "Kevin, stop playing.
Let your hands go."

1249
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,626
All right.

1250
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,337
"Ask and you shall receive."

1251
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,590
I hope he got the Weather Channel,

1252
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,800
'cause this is about to be some lightning.

1253
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:35,470
When you throw a jab, you take a step.

1254
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:37,514
Take a step,
let the jab go at the same time.

1255
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,558
Turn it over. Every time. [mimics punch]

1256
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:41,726
That's how you throw it.

1257
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,187
I take my step.
I'm about to turn it over. I'm right here.

1258
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,481
Here it is. About to turn that bitch over.

1259
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:48,399
You better brace yourself. Here it come.

1260
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,945
Ooh. It's coming. Right here.
I'm right here,

1261
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,239
but I'm about to get here. Here I am,

1262
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,950
but I'm about to get right there.
You better brace yourself.

1263
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,452
I'm right here. Before I did that…

1264
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,828
[knocking]

1265
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,206
he hit me.

1266
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,875
I immediately lost my vision.

1267
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:09,295
Immediately. I went blind immediately.

1268
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,464
Couldn't see shit. Everything was black.

1269
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,425
Aah…

1270
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,262
I read that you could get brain damage
or die from a punch.

1271
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,389
I just lost my fucking vision.

1272
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,558
I don't have eyesight no more.

1273
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,851
I can't see. I panicked. I turned around.

1274
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:26,104
I've been known
to do this move several times.

1275
00:59:26,187 --> 00:59:29,566
I start punching backwards.
I've talked about it in my past specials.

1276
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,152
I'm a backwards puncher.
When I panic, I fucking start punching.

1277
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,114
My trainer said, "Kevin, throw the jab,
throw the jab!"

1278
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:38,866
I said, "For what, liar?"

1279
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:42,328
It ain't lightning
unless he's a storm tracker, okay?

1280
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,330
Because this is fucking ridiculous.

1281
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,332
I'm blind. I can't see shit.

1282
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:47,792
Aah!

1283
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,794
I'm blind.

1284
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,006
"Ring the bell. Ring the fucking bell."

1285
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,924
The bell rings.

1286
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,177
I can't get to the corner.
I gotta follow his voice to the corner.

1287
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,095
Aah!

1288
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,640
As I get to the corner, my trainer,

1289
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,935
he's like, "What's wrong?"
I said, "I'm blind. I can't fucking see."

1290
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,064
He just lift my head gear up…

1291
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,193
Apparently, when he hit me,
he knocked my head gear over my eyes.

1292
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:18,156
It was black, so I was just looking
at the back of it the whole time.

1293
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,908
He's like, "Why didn't you lift it up?"

1294
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,745
I said, "Because we never
went over that in practice."

1295
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,873
"I think you put too much Vaseline on me."

1296
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,083
"That's why
I was sliding all over the place."

1297
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,253
"Sliding all over the fucking place.
I don't wanna do this no more."

1298
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:34,505
"You're just gonna quit?"
"I don't call it that,

1299
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:36,257
"I just wanna do something else."

1300
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,217
"What you gonna tell him?"

1301
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,387
I said, "I'm never talking to him again
in my fucking life."

1302
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:43,473
"My lawyer will talk to him.
He's going to jail."

1303
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:47,143
"I bet you that.
He's going to fucking jail after this."

1304
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,480
"What he did to me tonight was assault.
That's what the fuck this was."

1305
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,024
"Assault at the highest level."

1306
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:56,027
I quit. Walked away from boxing that day.

1307
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:58,613
Walked away. Never went back.

1308
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,867
Later on, I decided
to look up some tape on Lefty Lou Earl.

1309
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:04,661
I went and found this guy.

1310
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,621
I wanted to know who he was.

1311
01:01:06,704 --> 01:01:08,665
Who are you comparing me to?

1312
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,000
After that display of boxing that I gave,

1313
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,504
I wanted to see who the fuck
was like me or who was I like?

1314
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:18,216
Turns out Lefty Lou Earl had one arm.

1315
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,177
He was a handicapped fighter.

1316
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,263
He was one in thirty-eight.

1317
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:26,182
His one win came from disqualification.

1318
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,893
He got knocked out,
they kicked him in the face.

1319
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,520
That's why they gave him the "W."

1320
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,689
He had a squeaky voice.

1321
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:35,817
So my trainer was talking
about my voice all this time.

1322
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,985
It had nothing to do with
my fighting style.

1323
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:40,822
Just so happened to compare me
to a handicapped fighter.

1324
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:45,410
I know, I'm gonna get a lot of shit after
this joke from fucking one-armed people.

1325
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:48,579
I guess, they'll cancel me next,
I don't know.

1326
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,332
Good news is their rally won't last long

1327
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,043
'cause they can't hold them signs
for too long. [chuckles]

1328
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,421
'Cause they only got one… [chuckles]

1329
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:00,174
They're gonna get tired.
They gotta put them arms down.

1330
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:02,009
Unless they coordinate it right

1331
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:04,595
with the equal amount
of right hands and left hands,

1332
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:07,306
they're not gonna get
their message across to cancel me.

1333
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,726
So… that's some good news.

1334
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,770
Maybe I should take that one out.

1335
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:15,898
Let's take that one out.
I'm gonna get canceled for that one.

1336
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:19,777
Fuck it. I'm in my house.
I'm gonna say what the fuck I want.

1337
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:21,195
-It's a joke.
-[crowd applauding]

1338
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:22,697
It's a joke.

1339
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:28,745
I was so happy, man, after that spar,
because that was the first sign

1340
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:30,830
that I was back to myself of old.

1341
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:33,249
I started sparring after my accident.

1342
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,002
You guys don't know, a year ago,
I got into a really bad car accident.

1343
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,087
Almost fucking died, man.

1344
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,214
Damn near paralyzed.
A lot of bad shit happened.

1345
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,468
I was in a hospital for a minute.
Thought about a lot.

1346
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,970
'Cause I thought about a lot,
I can now ask you things

1347
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,222
that I know you haven't thought about.

1348
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:52,393
Question number one is,
do you have an ass wiper in your life?

1349
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,311
Think about it.

1350
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:55,313
An ass wiper.

1351
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,940
Somebody that will wipe your ass

1352
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,943
if shit hit the fan
for the rest of your life, if need be.

1353
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,822
You don't think you need it
until you fucking need it.

1354
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,159
After surgery, I didn't go
to the bathroom for eight days.

1355
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,577
I was constipated.

1356
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,038
They wouldn't let me leave
until I went to the bathroom.

1357
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,790
Had to make sure my organs were working.

1358
01:03:13,873 --> 01:03:17,084
I had somebody by my side
every single day.

1359
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:21,422
On day nine, there was a 20-minute gap
when I was by myself.

1360
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:23,382
During this gap,
it felt like somebody threw

1361
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:26,636
a stick of dynamite in my fucking stomach
and that bitch exploded.

1362
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,179
Boo! Uh-oh.

1363
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:30,681
Uh-oh. I gotta go.

1364
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,308
I gotta go to the fucking bathroom.

1365
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,477
Can't move my legs. I can't move my arms.

1366
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,145
There's nobody there.

1367
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:38,314
I start pressing the help button. "Help!"

1368
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,609
"Help! Help!"

1369
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:45,196
"Help! Somebody gotta help!"

1370
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:46,823
José came running in the room.

1371
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,700
José was a 60-year-old Mexican nurse.

1372
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:51,244
"What's up, my friend?"

1373
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,663
[crowd laughing]

1374
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:56,749
"José."

1375
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,543
"I gotta go to the bathroom, man, now."

1376
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,336
"I gotta go right now."

1377
01:04:00,419 --> 01:04:03,589
"Okay. I got you, man.
I'll take care of you. I'll get you good."

1378
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,800
José grabbed my legs, grabs my upper body,

1379
01:04:05,883 --> 01:04:08,928
picks me up, sits me on the toilet
that was right next to the bed.

1380
01:04:09,011 --> 01:04:12,723
After he sits me on the toilet,
José took two giant steps backwards,

1381
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,560
[grunts] folded his arms,
was looking me in the eye,

1382
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,520
rocking back and forth like this.

1383
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,438
"Oh, no."

1384
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:21,607
"The fuck is happening, José?"

1385
01:04:22,316 --> 01:04:24,902
"I gotta go, man. Why you still here?"

1386
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:29,740
Then it dawned on me,
"Oh, my God, José's gotta wipe my ass."

1387
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:33,202
"Oh, this is rock bottom. This is it."

1388
01:04:33,995 --> 01:04:38,624
"This is rock fucking bottom. I'm here.
It can't get worse than this."

1389
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:42,503
When I say that, José decides
to say things that make me feel better.

1390
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:45,131
"Don't worry, man.
I'm gonna wipe you good, okay?"

1391
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,467
"I'm gonna wipe you good, okay, man?"

1392
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:52,430
"I got you. You're in good hands with me.
I'mma wipe you good, okay, man?"

1393
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,601
At this point, I'm fucking in disbelief.

1394
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,728
I just can't believe what's happening.

1395
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:00,938
I can't hold it. I just go. I start going.

1396
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:04,859
José decides to cheer me on.
"Good, good, good."

1397
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:09,655
"You gotta get it out, man."

1398
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,658
"Eight days' a long time
for anybody, man."

1399
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:17,038
I get done going,
José grabs my right arm, rolls me over.

1400
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:19,540
José starts wiping my ass.

1401
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,877
At this point,
a single tear rolls down my fucking cheek.

1402
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:25,254
I'm crying.

1403
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,967
The reason I'm crying is because
my arms are numb, my legs are numb.

1404
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,260
But I couldn't figure out

1405
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,430
why God would leave feeling
in the space of my ass.

1406
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,725
Why not numb that up, too?

1407
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,936
Why let me feel
what the fuck is happening?

1408
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:44,398
At the lowest point of my life,
why feel José wiping my ass?

1409
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,902
Crying uncontrollably at this point.

1410
01:05:49,654 --> 01:05:51,697
José decides to say something else.

1411
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,951
"It's okay, man.
This is crazy, man. I know."

1412
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,828
"Imagine how I feel, man."

1413
01:05:59,413 --> 01:06:01,832
"I can't believe
I'm wiping Kevin Hart's ass, man."

1414
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:02,875
[crowd laughs and applauds]

1415
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,044
"This is crazy."

1416
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,798
-"It's my first famous ass, man."
-[crowd cheering]

1417
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:13,678
Guys, this has been
such an amazing night of fucking comedy.

1418
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,721
Dude, it's been such a great night.

1419
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,722
[all cheering]

1420
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:22,103
Such a great, intimate night.
We shared so much.

1421
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:26,774
I love it. It's such a different vibe.
It's a comfortable vibe. It's a sexy vibe.

1422
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:30,486
More importantly,
it was a vibe that I got to be myself in,

1423
01:06:30,569 --> 01:06:33,948
but I don't want you guys to leave with
just some laughter from jokes.

1424
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,533
I feel like I can give you more.

1425
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:38,327
I want you to know me for more, okay?

1426
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,079
-'Cause I got more. I got more.
-[crowd applauding]

1427
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,542
With that being said,

1428
01:06:44,625 --> 01:06:46,585
I hope you guys are ready for some BOP.

1429
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:50,089
Bring out the BOP. That's right.
Brick-oven pizza for everybody.

1430
01:06:50,172 --> 01:06:54,135
BOP! Yes, that's right.
I got some BOP for you.

1431
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:55,970
-I see you.
-[all applauding]

1432
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:59,056
[all chanting] BOP!

1433
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:03,394
Yes! Thank you guys so much.
What an amazing night.

1434
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:06,731
[chanting] BOP! BOP!

1435
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,315
[gasps]

1436
01:07:09,525 --> 01:07:10,943
What's wrong with you, boy?

1437
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,030
-I just had the the craziest dream.
-Oh, my gosh.

1438
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:15,865
-No, it was crazy.
-It's okay.

1439
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,576
No, it's not.
I dreamt that I was on stage,

1440
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,662
and I was doing stand up
about stuff that I would never say.

1441
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:24,707
I called my daughter a ho.
I called my son dumb.

1442
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:29,837
I said I don't like private school
and the plant-based community was wilin'.

1443
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:30,755
-[sputters]
-All right.

1444
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,300
I went through this whole phase
where I said I was at Seinfeld's house.

1445
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:37,219
I ain't never been to Seinfeld's house.
I said, I said--

1446
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:38,804
Go back to sleep.

1447
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:40,848
-You were just having a bad nightmare.
-[groans]

1448
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:45,186
-Just a nightmare, right?
-Yeah.

1449
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,230
It was just… It was just a nightmare.

1450
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,566
Yes, go back to sleep, please.

1451
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:53,861
You ever had BOP?

1452
01:07:55,237 --> 01:07:56,113
No?

1453
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,324
