00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,441
<i>Introducing... Daniel Sosa!</i>

5
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,631
How's everyone doing?

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,762
Louder! How are you?

7
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,268
-I love you, handsome!
-I love you, too.

8
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,147
It's a shit ton of people, bro.

9
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,150
Thank you all for being here.

10
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,861
I'm very happy because I'm filming
my second comedy special,

11
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,823
and I decided to do it in Mexico
because I love everybody here.

12
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,576
A round of applause for all of you here.

13
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:28,171
I decided to do it here because people
don't know me in other countries.

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,176
It's not like I can go to Amsterdam
and say, "Yeah, here I am!" I can't.

15
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,221
They don't even know me in the US.

16
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,265
I was just in Los Angeles,
one of my favorite cities,

17
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,393
to learn more about their culture,
their history--

18
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,604
I went to Disney. I went to Disneyland.

19
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,983
If anyone watches this over there,

20
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,444
they'll be like, "Son of a bitch,
put up the wall now.."

21
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,949
I went to Disney to see the differences
in our cultures, and there are a ton.

22
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:58,284
I got to go to <i>The Walking Dead</i> and--

23
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,580
Ma'am, so you know, <i>The Walking Dead</i>
is like a Mexican haunted house<i>...</i>

24
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,377
but without the Weeping Lady,
the Boogeyman.

25
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,920
They're all zombies.

26
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,548
So, I got there and I was like,
"Let's check it out."

27
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,301
And I noticed we're not afraid of zombies,
because we know they don't exist.

28
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,805
What we're afraid of is walking
into a dark place where you can't see shit

29
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,890
and out of the blue someone goes...

30
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,268
That's pretty much it.

31
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,311
And you're crouching
in your safe position like,

32
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,064
"As long as I stay like this, I'm safe.

33
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,359
But if I stand up, I'm exposed.
So I'll just stay down here."

34
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,529
Being there,
I realized that Latin Americans,

35
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,989
especially Mexicans,

36
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,409
are the ones who curse the most
when they're scared!

37
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,996
I mean, there are kids
making memories in there, dumbass!

38
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,417
And you're like,
"Cocksucker motherfucking--

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,752
Did you see that? It looks so real!"

40
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:53,173
How can it look real? It's a zombie.
They don't exist, you idiot!

41
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,509
Outside these rides,
there's always a kid crying

42
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,304
because he doesn't want to go in,

43
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,015
and the father is saying, "Don't cry!

44
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,476
They're normal people wearing makeup.

45
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,730
I'll bring one out and show you."
And I'm like, "No, you asshole!"

46
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:11,608
The kid has been eating sugar
all fucking day.

47
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,946
A zombie is going to go... And the kid...
"Where can you get a <i>bolillo</i> at Disney?"

48
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,116
That's what we're exposing our kids to.

49
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,369
And in analyzing all the Disney crap,
I realized

50
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,663
that Disney and Universal Studios

51
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,166
are the only places
that should be allowed to be theme parks,

52
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,961
because in Mexico we have
the most ridiculous theme parks.

53
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,215
The Saint Judas Thaddeus
motherfucking Fair.

54
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,760
The Saint Marcos Fair.

55
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,013
"That's not a saint, it's a place."
I know, but it's still a saint.

56
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,849
When these saints died,
the Bible didn't say,

57
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:48,645
"To remember them,
you've got to trash the streets,

58
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,774
get wasted, have fireworks...
They love fireworks, a shit ton of them."

59
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,525
No, man.

60
00:03:55,068 --> 00:04:00,281
Then I thought,
"At Disney, you see Mickey Mouse,

61
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,408
and you take a picture. That's cool."

62
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,577
But at the Saint Judas Fair,
what the fuck?

63
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,539
"Holy shit, it's Saint Charbel!
I want a picture with Saint Charbel!"

64
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,000
No.

65
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,462
"There's Saint Antonio! But on our heads!
Everybody, on your head!"

66
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,132
See how we look like fucking idiots?

67
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,134
Thank you.

68
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,642
They're going to hate me.

69
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,895
All the old ladies are saying,
"What a rude boy."

70
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,234
At the--

71
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:40,321
At the Saint Judas Thaddeus Fair,
we have souvenirs that aren't worth shit.

72
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,283
At Disney, they've got
Mickey Mouse ears.

73
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,326
They light up.
It makes sense. It's Mickey.

74
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,538
What are they going to sell at this fair?
Crowns of thorns that light up?

75
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,540
No.

76
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,293
I don't know
what a caterpillar with a hooker face

77
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,963
has to do with a religious celebration.

78
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,090
You know
the ride I'm talking about, right?

79
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,092
This caterpillar ride in small town fairs

80
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,761
with a face that looks like
it just took ecstasy.

81
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,930
It's like...

82
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,934
With makeup like a cheap hooker.

83
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,438
You see it and think,
"This thing must go fucking fast!"

84
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,689
Then you ride it and...

85
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,612
And your dad's yells from the side,
"Put your hands up!"

86
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,952
You get off, he asks, "Did you like it?"
"Don't talk to me, Dad."

87
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,914
We have the stupidest things
at the Saint Judas Fair,

88
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,584
like the Krakatoa Canoe ride.
You've seen it.

89
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:39,797
For those of you who don't know,
the Krakatoa Canoe is a metal boat,

90
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,967
and after you ride it,
you reek of metal all fucking day.

91
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:48,181
With a dragon's head on each side
and a bus tire underneath.

92
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,434
And to make matters worse,
you can't even fit inside.

93
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,479
You get on and you're all like...

94
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,652
Yeah, give me a sec. Let me just...

95
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,786
And then they tie you in with a rope.
"Tighter, bro!"

96
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:15,083
And the operator is a kid
who just flicks a switch and leaves!

97
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:16,876
It's like...

98
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:24,926
And you're there, endangering your life,
adrenaline pumping 'cause you might die.

99
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,013
Why do I do this? Really, why bother?

100
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:33,601
I could've been playing marbles.

101
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,355
And suddenly something breaks.
"Hey, kid! Kid!

102
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:41,567
Kid! Hey, kid! Somebody call the kid!

103
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,320
There's a weird noise, kid!"

104
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,075
And then....

105
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:59,961
You get off, and you're like,
"Don't anybody fucking talk to me."

106
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,005
We love to celebrate Saint Judas Thaddeus.

107
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,509
I have to make a side note here.

108
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,928
Did you all see what happened
to Saint Judas not long ago?

109
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,226
Did you see how he got all fucked up
on that bicycle?

110
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,693
Time out, guys. Come on. He's a saint.

111
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,949
As Mexicans, our superpower
is the ability to make religion tacky.

112
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:33,119
Saint Judas
became the drug dealer's saint.

113
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,373
When they go to Heaven, they're all like,
"What's up, Saint Judas? Pass the joint!"

114
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,628
We fucked Saint Judas up!

115
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,922
For those who haven't seen it,
look it up on YouTube,

116
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,508
Saint Judas on a bicycle
and see how he gets all fucked up.

117
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:52,346
Now imagine
you're a devout Catholic, right?

118
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,015
You're waiting in your car.

119
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,020
You obviously have your rosary
hanging from the rear view mirror.

120
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,356
And you're there...

121
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,318
and suddenly...

122
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,241
You turn around
and see a spinning bicycle wheel.

123
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,038
You think to help, open the door,

124
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,873
and see Saint Judas' head
on the ground and scream,

125
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,751
"How have I failed you, Lord?
What have I done?"

126
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:26,422
On top of that, the dude on the bike
crashed because he was being nosy.

127
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,175
He was riding, looking to the side...

128
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,384
And he's fucked.

129
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:35,181
That guy was going somewhere, right?
He got up early.

130
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,059
He cleaned his bike.

131
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,230
Tied Saint Judas,
so he wouldn't fall off.

132
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,900
Imagine if they went
over a pothole and he fell off.

133
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,113
Imagine when the poor bastard
got to his destination...

134
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,076
with his bicycle all fucked up...

135
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,495
and his sunglasses all crooked.

136
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:01,290
And everyone's like...

137
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,214
"Where's Saint Judas?"

138
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,840
And the dude goes...

139
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,304
"You won't believe what just happened."

140
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,944
Everybody's like,
"Holy shit, let's get another one!"

141
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,862
And they get a tiny little one.

142
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,368
I'll never get that tradition
of having a fair for Saint Judas,

143
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,453
but in Mexico
we have other beautiful traditions,

144
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,871
like the Day of the Dead.

145
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:44,166
The Day of the Dead
is a tradition full of culture and magic.

146
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,130
But when you strip out
the magical and cultural elements,

147
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:52,008
it's basically just watching food rot.

148
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,136
Your grandma always makes
a shit ton of food.

149
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,263
"What are you making, Grandma?"
"Mole."

150
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,933
"A whole pot?"
"Yes."

151
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,978
"Who for?"
"For your grandpa."

152
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,532
And is he coming?
Because that's a lot of food.

153
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,076
At least give him a piece of toast
or a taco or something.

154
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,540
And they just leave
the mole there, rotting.

155
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,792
You pass by
and want to stick your finger in.

156
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,378
In the pot, not in your grandmother.

157
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:32,298
It's not like, "Hey, what's up, Grandma!"

158
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,216
So, in the pot.

159
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:38,054
Keep laughing at your grandmas. Real nice.

160
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,266
When you're watching this at home,
"Let's skip this part, Grandma."

161
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,189
They leave the whole pot to rot,
and it's okay

162
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,940
because it's for your grandpa
who is with God now.

163
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,234
But don't you dare
not finish your chicken soup.

164
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,029
"There are people starving in Africa."

165
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,158
"But you made a whole pot--"
"It's not the same!"

166
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:06,457
I'm really moved by the Day of the Dead.
It really is very cool.

167
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,501
It's so cool
that the US made a film about it.

168
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,002
Did you all watch <i>Coco?</i>

169
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,172
Great film.

170
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,509
Don't make the same mistake I did
and watch it with the girl you like,

171
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,346
because it was like,
if she cries, I'll hug her.

172
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,891
If she doesn't understand,
I'll explain it.

173
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,020
If she wants something,
I'll pay for it. "Here's your idiot."

174
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,900
Everything was going fine
until the scene with the flower bridge.

175
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,611
And I go...

176
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,456
And she has the nerve to ask,
"Everything all right?"

177
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,717
"It's amazing how Disney captures
the magic of our traditions."

178
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,804
Then they turned on the theater lights
and I was like...

179
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,435
"We can wait
for everyone to leave if you want...

180
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,938
to see if there's gonna be a sequel,
<i>Coco Two.</i>

181
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,609
I actually read in <i>Cineminuto</i> that--
Wait, don't get up.

182
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,904
I read in <i>Cineminuto</i>
that there's gonna be a <i>Coco Two.</i>

183
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,451
Grandma Coco becomes evil
and turns into the Boogeyman.

184
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,705
You know, like in the lullaby in Spanish,
in which the Boogeyman is called Coco."

185
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,085
You finally leave the theater...

186
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,588
and she asks,
"Remember when the grandmother..."

187
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,886
But if you pay close attention,
the movie isn't that cool.

188
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:46,557
Look at how the US
is telling the rest of the world

189
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,519
that Mexicans are assholes to their kids
in regards chasing our dreams.

190
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,857
Miguel had to go
to another fucking world...

191
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,320
to ask for permission to play the guitar.

192
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,404
He wasn't trying to do anything wrong.

193
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,449
It's not like he wanted
to stick his finger in everybody's ass.

194
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,076
He just wanted to play the guitar
and had to go to another world

195
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,829
to ask his grandfather, and when he
gets there, his grandpa says,

196
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,999
"I'm not your grandfather."
"Don't fuck with me and say you're not!

197
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,543
They just made you a whole pot of mole!"

198
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,421
That's <i>Coco.</i>

199
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,979
It's really funny
because you can't see what I see.

200
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,690
And suddenly people go,
"Oh, yeah. He's right!

201
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,611
And I just bought it."

202
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,156
But I think Mexicans are much more

203
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,116
than families denying
their childrens' dreams.

204
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,578
We're people with a lot of love
and a lot of drive to succeed.

205
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:55,668
The real problem is
that we haven't been raised properly.

206
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,795
And I'm not just talking
about academic education.

207
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,673
I mean, music, telenovelas<i>,</i> social issues.

208
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,551
We've been raised like shit.
I'm exhibit A.

209
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,264
As kids, we were taught
the most idiotic songs.

210
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,598
Tatiana had a song that went...

211
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,685
<i>My house's backyard is very particular</i>

212
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,894
Why?

213
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,440
<i>It gets wet and dries</i>

214
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,025
That's not special, Tatiana.

215
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,571
Those kinds of songs
always play at family reunions,

216
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:27,408
and it's horrible because the kids
have to suffer through the whole thing.

217
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,077
Because let's be honest,
as kids, we hated those parties.

218
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,497
They make you wear shoes that don't fit
and fucking corduroy pants.

219
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,626
You get to the party and ask your mom,
"What time are we leaving?"

220
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,337
"At 4 p.m.," she'd say, but you'd always
leave at one in the fucking morning.

221
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,965
So you're like, "Okay, bitch. Okay.

222
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,967
You think I don't have shit to do?

223
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,221
My <i>Hielocos </i>are not going
to step into the fridge on their own!"

224
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,727
So, you would develop tricks
to leave the party on time.

225
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,105
And I don't care if there are doctors,
lawyers, or priests in the room.

226
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,857
You are all a bunch of hypocrites,

227
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,527
because you all faked being asleep
to leave a party as a kid.

228
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:08,908
We all have that memory of being "asleep"
on your mom's lap.

229
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,284
You're hearing everything like...

230
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,120
"Yeah, he already fell asleep.

231
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,832
He was jumping around all day long."

232
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,169
Nosy.

233
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,845
And you'd still cuddle like...

234
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,060
So, if you already know this,
next time your kids fall "asleep,"

235
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,895
say things to wake them up.

236
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,522
-"I'm going to fuck you in the--"
-"I'm up!

237
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,983
You have no idea
how much energy I have, Mom!

238
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,777
Let's play soccer!"

239
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,532
I've always had a problem
with Christmas time.

240
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,701
I've got to be really honest with you.

241
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,537
I come from a very tacky family.

242
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,292
Not everyone, but let's say nine
out of ten people in my family are tacky.

243
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:06,298
We really do some very, very tacky stuff.

244
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,633
I have an uncle, who I love to death,

245
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,261
but he's always showing off that nothing
is ever too spicy for him.

246
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,056
That's his achievement in life.
"No, that's not hot."

247
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,852
So? "No, habanero sucks balls."

248
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,649
We were eating the other day,
and as soon as I reached for the salsa,

249
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:28,112
my uncle goes, "Put some more, you pussy!"

250
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,532
I could very well ignore him
or say, "No thanks, uncle. I'm good.

251
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,368
I don't want to make myself cry.
I just want to eat a taquito."

252
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,453
But I'm a fucking idiot.

253
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,834
"Give me some more."

254
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,588
You take a bite of that shit
and your ears clog up.

255
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,882
Your mouth starts vibrating.

256
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,220
You start getting dizzy and think,
"Why? What's the use?"

257
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,390
And that's when you realize...

258
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,019
"If that's how much it hurts coming in...

259
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,273
when I take a shit...

260
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,110
my ass is going to be on fire".

261
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,863
It's something that happens to everyone,
but nobody talks about it.

262
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,490
My grandma has a lot of anal remedies.

263
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,076
Really! I'm being honest here.

264
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,162
She has a lot of remedies
for constipation.

265
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,790
When you can't take a dump,
my grandma knows exactly what to do.

266
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,460
A prune smoothie,
a mango smoothie, pineapple...

267
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,837
You'll shit water for weeks,
but it does help.

268
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,426
When you're constipated,
you don't know until you're on the toilet.

269
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,679
You get there
thinking you're going to take a shit.

270
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,610
"Yeah, I'll send it later.

271
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,280
I'm in a meeting right now.
I'll call you."

272
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,040
And you don't realize
how long you've been there

273
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,001
until you move your elbows
and notice two red marks here.

274
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,089
Everybody has been late
because of a dump. Be honest.

275
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,549
But you blame the fucking traffic.

276
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,345
That's when you think, "Damn,
it's getting late. I gotta hurry this up."

277
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,021
That's the normal sound.

278
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,234
Then comes a louder one.

279
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,446
You even get dizzy.

280
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,075
I'm glad I'm sitting down.

281
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,285
Then one where you go...

282
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,371
Oh, shit.

283
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,667
I'll turn into a Super Saiyan
before I'm able to take a shit.

284
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,419
And you give up and leave.

285
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:57,386
I know this is scatological,
but I told you I was tacky, so it's okay.

286
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,181
It's not like you thought
I was gonna be all sophisticated.

287
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,058
No, you knew what you came for.

288
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,688
I've got more stories
about my tacky family.

289
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,357
We're all tacky.
We're tacky through our ancestry.

290
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,570
We're put-baby-Jesus-to-sleep-on-Christmas
tacky.

291
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,199
But we tuck him in with such faith.

292
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,413
My grandma cuddles him and truly believes
she'll put him to sleep.

293
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,207
I really want baby Jesus
to close his eyes one day.

294
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,626
"Holy shit! He closed his eyes!
What do we do?"

295
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,548
And baby Jesus is hearing everything like,
"He closed his eyes! What do we do?"

296
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:51,273
Last year, I had the fortune to go buy
a baby Jesus at the baby Jesus store.

297
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,318
A little Jesus store, no?

298
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,948
Remember when Buzz Lightyear enters
the toy store and sees a bunch of himself?

299
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,076
Just like that, but with baby Jesus.
There was even one like Messi like this.

300
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,082
I'm like, "I'll take one."
And the clerk says, "Which one?"

301
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,794
And I say, "What do you mean?
They're not Barbies. The normal one.

302
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,297
If you have one that's asleep,
I'll take that one."

303
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:21,136
Why is it that even though everyone
knows the story of God and Jesus Christ,

304
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,264
it's only Mexicans who dress them up
and do all this crazy shit?

305
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,602
Has anyone been to Paris
and there's the Eiffel Tower

306
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,438
and right beside it there's
a baby Jesus retail and repair shop?

307
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,607
No! Only here!

308
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:37,027
And we dress them up in things
that are straight up wrong.

309
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:42,449
You can see my grandma saying,
"And here is your little crown."

310
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,743
Maybe it's in the same Bible that says

311
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,663
we gotta do all the crazy shit
for Saint Judas, too.

312
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,335
Who are these people
that keep believing in this crap?

313
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,546
Who is encouraging this
in this day and age?

314
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,425
It's even in soap operas.

315
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,970
Do you really believe

316
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,430
that if you experience a miracle,
a white rose will appear?

317
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,433
No, man. It's not going to happen.

318
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,020
But that's what soaps teach us,
a bunch of crap.

319
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,398
Catalina Creel had an eye patch
and was the villain.

320
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,443
She was the Jack Sparrow of soap operas.

321
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:23,490
Then we had another soap on earlier
when kids were still watching

322
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,701
in which a woman screams
at a girl in a wheel chair,

323
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,662
"What are you doing kissing
my man, you damn cripple!"

324
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,082
Bro, she was a child.

325
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,502
And it was daytime television,
and that was fine.

326
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,462
If you don't think that's fucked up,
I dare you to tell

327
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,341
the next person you see in a wheel chair,
"Excuse me, you damn cripple."

328
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,094
No, that's fucking offensive!

329
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,182
We've always been told
that if it's on television, it's okay.

330
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,643
I grew up with that, and it's fucked up!

331
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,772
They recently made
a soap opera with Maite Perroni

332
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,733
in which she bangs her head...

333
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,485
on the side mirror of a mini van.

334
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,281
And she's in a coma just for that shit.

335
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,576
She was arguing with a dude,
and what do we do when we argue?

336
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,995
She sprinted out into the street.

337
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:14,499
We see the mini van and think,
"Fuck, it's going to run her over.

338
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,002
She'll end up like Saint Judas."

339
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,714
But no, she just... It's like...

340
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,425
The side mirror was in the scene,
and it was like, "Action!"

341
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,598
And that was it.
She's in a coma for that shit.

342
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,434
She's rushed to a government hospital
where she's quickly treated.

343
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,688
The nurses are hot.
That doesn't happen in real life!

344
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,357
Have you ever been
to one of these hospitals?

345
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,194
Nurses are like healthcare Oompa Loompas.

346
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,490
They all look alike.
"Was it you or your cousin? Tell me!"

347
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,201
They mess with our heads.

348
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,706
Nowadays, we have so many media outlets
and distribution channels

349
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,376
that I wonder
who is watching this content.

350
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,545
And I kid you not, it's the people
from the lower classes.

351
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,880
For example, the cleaning ladies.

352
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,634
I want to stop now and note that cleaning
ladies don't just give us a clean home.

353
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,303
They give us part of their lives
and years of youth.

354
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,223
Let's give a round of applause
to all the cleaning ladies, please.

355
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,273
They are all very nice.

356
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,402
But...

357
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,490
sometimes they're dumb as shit.
Let's accept that.

358
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:31,451
They don't put your stuff away.
They hide it.

359
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:35,455
You're looking for your shit like an idiot
thinking, "She must have stolen it.

360
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,917
I hope she gets mugged on the subway.
I really do."

361
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,003
It brings out your shittiest side.

362
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,756
And that's not even now.
That's when you were a kid.

363
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,218
Remember how, as a kid, you had
that one toy, your toy, your pogs.

364
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,347
You held your pogs and your self esteem
in the same plastic tube.

365
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,978
You wouldn't take them to P.E. class,
because you might lose them.

366
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:02,524
So, you'd leave them in a safe place.
And what's safer than your own home?

367
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:07,904
So, you'd leave them on your nightstand,
right by your hopes and dreams.

368
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:11,533
What could happen to them?
And you're off to school.

369
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,872
When you come back, you see
your bedroom door open and you're like...

370
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,960
"No, say it ain't so.

371
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:26,339
How can this be possible, dear Jesus?"

372
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,426
You start going up the stairs
and it smells like Mr. Clean.

373
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,678
"Don't mess with me. It can't be true.

374
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,223
It is Mr. Clean, God damn it.

375
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,436
You even grab your baby Jesus
to accompany you on this quest.

376
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,771
So there goes baby Jesus like...

377
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:47,194
You get to your room,
the cleaning lady is grabbing your stuff.

378
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,695
And you're afraid
to look over at the nightstand

379
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,322
because you know your pogs won't be there.

380
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,992
And you're like,
"Our Father, who art in Heaven..."

381
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,328
with a rosary in your hand,
"...hallowed be thy name."

382
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:59,998
And as soon as you can't find them,
you get the Devil up your ass.

383
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:05,962
And you go up to the cleaning lady
and ask, "Have you seen my pogs?"

384
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,840
"Your what?"
"My pogs, you idiot!"

385
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,094
"The plastic tube?"
"Yes!"

386
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,681
"I threw it away."
"I hope they mug you on the subway."

387
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,225
And you'd leave...

388
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,895
full of anger and hate, not knowing
what was happening in your life.

389
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,858
You'd wonder who could help you
through these dark times.

390
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,568
And who better than your mom
to cuddle you with her motherly love

391
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:30,904
and guide you back to happiness.

392
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,573
So you go up to her,
looking like shit and say,

393
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,491
"Mom..."

394
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,332
"Did you look for it?"
"Yes, everywhere. She stole it!"

395
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,712
Your mom would listen to all that,
take a good look at you...

396
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,757
and go like this...

397
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,446
And that was the fuck she gave.

398
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,992
She didn't care one bit
about what you just said.

399
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,753
She'd always say,
"I'll get you another one."

400
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,549
And you'd be like,
"It's not about buying, you damn cripple."

401
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:38,054
I really didn't have
a good time at school.

402
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,765
I didn't have a cool experience.

403
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,685
There were games I didn't understand.
Stupid games like

404
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,981
taking the glue stick, taking the cap off,
and then doing this...

405
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,069
Turn it over
and start making spider webs.

406
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:55,947
If you were the class idiot,

407
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,116
they'd take it away
and stick it on the ceiling.

408
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,995
"Come on, man! We've got class."

409
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,835
"Yeah, miss, I'm coming.
My glue stick is up there."

410
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:15,008
Other shitty games,
like hiding your fucking backpack.

411
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,969
Remember that fucking "game"?

412
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,097
There was always the first hiding
of a backpack, and you'd be like,

413
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,975
"Crap, they're gonna start
with their shit."

414
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,896
And you were petrified
to be the next idiot.

415
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,108
So, you'd take your backpack
and put it between your legs like this.

416
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,113
And you would still make fun of the guy
whose backpack was hidden,

417
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,533
but you'd always slip and get fucked up.

418
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,078
Suddenly, you'd look down and...

419
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,877
"Our Father, who art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name..."

420
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,215
You look around
and all your friends are giggling.

421
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,679
Meanwhile, you're having cold sweats.

422
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,099
"My mom's gonna fucking kill me.

423
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,769
Please don't let them
throw my stuff in the trash."

424
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,564
All of this
with an I-don't-give-a-fuck face.

425
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,154
"I know where it is."

426
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:35,422
You even had to take your backpack out
to recess or they'd hide it.

427
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,174
You thought it couldn't get worse.

428
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,928
And then the teacher says,
"I'm coming to collect your homework.

429
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,684
You see her walking around
and you're like...

430
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,731
You don't even have
your backpack to look in.

431
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,778
She'd walk up to you and ask,
"Homework?"

432
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,577
And that's the moment
you're most humiliated.

433
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,666
"They hid my backpack."

434
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,504
"Nobody leaves until..."
And there you are...

435
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,048
walking through the rows like an idiot.

436
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,428
"Give it back, Antonio."

437
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:30,059
And it's very far away. You have to walk
with all your dignity to get it.

438
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,736
"They took out all my stuff."

439
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,116
I was that idiot
who always got his stuff hidden.

440
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,285
School was always a problem for me.

441
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,788
We had classes that I didn't understand.

442
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:53,708
Stupid bullshit classes like music.

443
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,212
Classes in which we'd learn
about Beethoven, Mozart, Manzanero.

444
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,005
Old guys who've done something.

445
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:05,512
With an instrument very fitting for
this type of music education: the flute.

446
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,516
There was always the asshole that went...
And you'd be like, "Shut up, dude!"

447
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:14,187
And the teacher's pissed. "Don't do that,
or the flute will get out of tune."

448
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,565
How will it get out of tune
if it's a fucking tube?

449
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,902
On Facebook, they do it with a carrot.

450
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,531
Then you realize there's spit in it.

451
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,158
And you're like...

452
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,914
If it were a Catholic school,
you'd be like, "God bless you."

453
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,469
If you were poor,
you had the translucent flute.

454
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,099
If you were poor and tacky,
it was translucent and colorful.

455
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,893
Remember?

456
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,522
They taught you the most idiotic songs.

457
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,817
It made me mad because
we supposedly also had a sports class,

458
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,153
which by the way,
I don't know who the fuck said

459
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,823
Duck Duck Goose was a fucking sport.

460
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,828
Is there a Duck Duck Goose event
at the Olympics with a national team?

461
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:16,416
No! You remember the game?
With all the kids sitting in a circle

462
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:20,128
with one kid going,
"Duck... duck... duck..."

463
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,880
and to the fat girl, "Goose."

464
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,384
You could see the fat girl
sweat just from getting up.

465
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,182
Her tits would clap as she ran.
Tits at nine years old!

466
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,353
She'd get to the classroom
and drink her guayaba juice.

467
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,772
"It was really hot today, wasn't it?"

468
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,860
That girl that always smelled
like hot sauce. Always.

469
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:50,241
It makes me mad because
those were the classes that formed us.

470
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:57,332
We had history classes
in which we had a ton of books,

471
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,459
like the Mexican history book

472
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,211
with Miguel Hidalgo holding
a banner with the Virgin Mary.

473
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,047
And he's really buff. Really buff.

474
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:09,302
As if he did Crossfit.
With a lot of wind blowing. A ton of wind.

475
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,555
Morelos at his side, emotional, like,
"Here are the feelings of our nation."

476
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,976
On the back cover there's Pipila like,
"This stone ain't heavy!"

477
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,730
Turn the page and he's like,
"It's not heavy here either!"

478
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,360
It looked more like a cover
for the Avengers than a history book.

479
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,404
There were books that were so stupid,
like the atlas.

480
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:31,908
A book that, just like the soccer team,
isn't good for shit.

481
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,079
It didn't even fit in your backpack!
You're like...

482
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,381
Grab it there. Yeah, there.

483
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:52,512
You'd leave it half sticking out,
brushing against the back of your head.

484
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:58,059
Our Spanish book would tell us stories,
like the one about Paco el Chato.

485
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,355
What the fuck do I care
about Paco el Chato?

486
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,984
Except that his name
sounds like a grocery store.

487
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:12,073
In history class, we were taught a lot
of bullshit about our national identity

488
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,034
that I don't understand or care about,
like the story of the <i>Niños Héroes.</i>

489
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,788
It couldn't have been real.
Do you think it was real?

490
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,916
Of course not!
Say it out loud. Don't be pussies.

491
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:26,254
Do you really think
that after the battle with the Americans

492
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,424
they had forensic detectives
look at Juan Escutia?

493
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,843
And the first thing they thought was...

494
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,636
"This...

495
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,097
This was for our nation."

496
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,852
He was a kid. There was gunfire!\
"But this is Mexico. This is our nation.

497
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,021
He's so Mexican
that if you get close, you hear...

498
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:47,650
'Damn cripple.' See? It's Mexico!"

499
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,611
And they make us believe this crap.

500
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,577
History has taught us a lot.
It taught us to learn from our mistakes.

501
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,746
Or so we say
that's what history taught us.

502
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:03,166
And we realized we are a stupid race.
Really.

503
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,710
We're the race that
when the Spaniards came...

504
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,922
to sell us mirrors, we bought them.

505
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,136
They said, "Here are the mirrors.
And they're expensive."

506
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,557
And the Aztecs were like,
"I don't give a fuck about the price.

507
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,852
Just because I'm brown
doesn't mean I don't have any money.

508
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,230
Give it to me
no matter how expensive it is."

509
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:30,276
Imagine the first Aztec who bought
a mirror and got home to his wife.

510
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,362
"Look what I got.

511
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,157
A mirror.

512
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,708
If I put my foot there,
you can see it.

513
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:48,836
And there you can't."

514
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,464
And the wife goes...

515
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,096
"How much did you pay for that, Arturotl?"

516
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,434
"You're going to get mad..."

517
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,901
Even though I can speak coherently now,

518
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,820
I was a fucking dumbass in school.

519
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:17,698
If I'd heard
what I'm saying back then, I'd be like,

520
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,784
"What the fuck are you talking about?"

521
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,746
Let's help
so there are fewer morons like me.

522
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,501
I was so stupid that when I got a test,
it was like, "Name: Daniel Sosa."

523
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:29,836
"Last name:"

524
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,758
I fucked up on the one I knew.

525
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,052
So you go and ask for help.

526
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,139
"Miss?

527
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,475
Excuse me!

528
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,603
I have a question."

529
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,689
She's like, "Yes?"

530
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,316
"Could you come here?

531
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,028
I could cheat on the way,
so you better come here."

532
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,116
She gets to your desk and you're like,
"Well, there's something here that...

533
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:04,579
Two things.
First, how do you spell infrastructure?

534
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:05,663
And second...

535
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,958
My name-- Please don't flunk me."

536
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,712
That was me in school.
I really had a rough time.

537
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:17,508
Every time there was a group project
and the teacher said groups of three...

538
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,093
"Can it be four?"

539
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,805
"No... Three."

540
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,765
"Come on. One group of four!"

541
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:29,520
"So we can be together
and we don't have to move our chairs."

542
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,275
"It's not because of the chairs.
There aren't enough of you."

543
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,402
"Exactly, one group of--

544
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,487
Oh, yes, you're right."

545
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,451
"But really,
can't there be a group of four?"

546
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,870
The problem with group projects

547
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:48,122
was that you had to go
to a friend's house to do it.

548
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:53,127
And whoever's house it was,
they thought that was all they had to do.

549
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,839
"What? I'm offering
my house for the project.

550
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:01,385
I live here.
I've got my pogs, my baby Jesus.

551
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,848
In that hole over there,
we had a Saint Judas, but we lost him."

552
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,520
And then,
when you had to present the project,

553
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,649
We didn't have
SMART boards or iPads back then.

554
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,319
We didn't any of that crap.
We had a chalk board.

555
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:23,366
And you had to put your hand-written
cardboard poster up there.

556
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,121
"Did you bring tape?"
"No."

557
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,582
"You?"
"No."

558
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,209
"You?"
"I offered the house."

559
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,627
"Fuck you, man. Really."

560
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:39,173
So you're there and go, "You start."

561
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,133
"You."

562
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,265
"So... Oh, do you start or do I?"

563
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,436
"Hi, we're group One B."

564
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,274
The <i>Niños Héroes...</i>

565
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:01,654
Like the name implies, they were kids
who were also heroes."

566
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:06,993
You started your presentation,
and as soon as you looked at cardboard,

567
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:09,078
the teacher would go, "Don't read."

568
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,249
"Fuck off."

569
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,251
"What?"

570
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,753
"I can't read the handwriting anyway."

571
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,633
So you've been presenting
to the class for a while now,

572
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:27,847
and you think it's time to also direct
your attention to the teacher.

573
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,933
So, you turn your head
ever so slightly towards her.

574
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,351
"That's why the <i>Niños Héroes..."</i>

575
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:36,147
And the teacher goes, "Don't tell me.
Tell the rest of the class."

576
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,692
It made you want
to punch her in the face, right?

577
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,528
But it was illegal,
so you had to be like...

578
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:49,493
You'd finish your presentation,
and in the back, you'd hear,

579
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,953
"I have a question."

580
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,542
You look over and it's the fat girl
from Duck Duck Goose.

581
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,218
"How to stop eating? Shut your mouth.
I think that would do it!"

582
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,055
And from that moment on,
she'd make your life a living hell.

583
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,933
And by the way, during my tour, I've been
trying to locate my teacher, Miss Magda.

584
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:17,063
Miss Magda from the Youth Institute.
If you see her, tell her to fuck off.

585
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,484
What a bitch. She'd come
into the classroom and wouldn't say hi.

586
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,569
She'd come into the fucking room and...

587
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:35,289
"Write this down: The <i>Niños Héroes.</i>
<i>Niños Héroes</i> were..."

588
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,085
Say hi! You'd get all nervous.
"Write this down. Write this down."

589
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,631
You start writing and she says,
"Hurry up because I'll erase it soon."

590
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,841
And you're like, "Oh, no! More pressure!"

591
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,346
And you're really trying hard
with all your might.

592
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:55,059
You're thinking, "Today will be the day
I'll do my work. My mom will be proud...

593
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,811
She erased it! Shit!

594
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,189
Warn us, Goddamn it!

595
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,942
My hand hurts."

596
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:07,613
And that was your first encounter
with failure and disappointment.

597
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,950
"I'll copy it from someone later."
And you never did.

598
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:17,873
Then you'd see girls in your class
who were able to write

599
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,876
with two different colored pens
in the same hand.

600
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,048
"Red... black... red...
I underline in red... black..."

601
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,052
And you're all stupid like...

602
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,014
I hated that.

603
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,812
I had to buy that pen
with the four different colors.

604
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,607
But since we didn't have a lot of money,
I got a knockoff.

605
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,026
So, when I pressed the black ink...

606
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,322
I'd try to write and it would pop back in.

607
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,451
So I'd have to push, hold...

608
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,412
You know? Like, "Why? What's the use?"

609
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:59,874
That's what I had to go through.

610
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,470
One time, I had school supplies
that denoted extreme poverty.

611
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,932
By "one time," I mean all through school.

612
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,729
I had the pencil
with the broken lead inside.

613
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,316
And when you sharpened it...

614
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,568
the tip would go...

615
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,827
A friend would say, "Don't be stupid.
Use your drafting compass."

616
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,330
So there you are with the open compass,

617
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:42,082
hurting your finger saying,
"Shit, it hurts."

618
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,045
I had a gum eraser. Remember those?

619
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,379
They were amazing.

620
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,008
I had one of those,
but it was dried out, so it was cheaper.

621
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:54,386
So when I erased, it was like,
"Oh, shit. I ripped the paper."

622
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,307
And the same friend would say, "Don't be
an idiot. You know your finger erases?

623
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,809
So there I go like an idiot,
smudging the page.

624
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,313
As if it were Ash Wednesday
in your notebook.

625
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:09,235
You don't know how humiliating it was
to ask for supplies from other students.

626
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,862
They'd be in another class
talking about Aristotle, when suddenly...

627
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,864
"Come in."

628
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,286
"Anyone got a pencil I could borrow?"

629
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,458
Really, school
was really complicated for me.

630
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,753
I had these shitty colored pencils
called Little Map...

631
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:33,092
that fit in your pants pockets.
All of your colored pencils here.

632
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,639
I had 20-some pencils,
and if my math is right...

633
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,350
there are more states than colors.

634
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,436
So you can't color a map
with your Little Map pencils.

635
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,109
If anybody here had
Faber-Castell colored pencils,

636
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,696
those boxes
with colors like for an architect...

637
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,781
Fuck you very much, really.

638
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:01,120
They made my life miserable.
The box of colored pencils would go...

639
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,875
"Which color do you want, boy?"

640
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,629
You asked if there's red and it answered,

641
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:13,966
"Fire red, lava red,
passion red, love red, crimson red..."

642
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,511
If someone asked me if I had red...

643
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,899
"It's orange, but if you press hard,
it looks like red."

644
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,082
Very funny, right?

645
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,671
In school,
they don't teach you stuff for real life.

646
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,633
In sex ed class they say, "Use a condom."

647
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,344
And that's it.
That's all you need to know.

648
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,138
But they don't tell you
that when you're going to use it,

649
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,973
you're with your girl, your lady.

650
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,976
You're on the couch. It always starts
on the couch. And you're like...

651
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:15,277
There's always a misty kiss,
you know what I'm talking about?

652
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:24,495
A kiss that makes you say,
"Wait, wait. The canoe just splashed.

653
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,705
The marzipan is crumbling."

654
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:31,251
From there, you move to the bed
with your girlfriend or wife...

655
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,383
And you say, "Take your top off."

656
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,761
And what does she say?
"You take it off."

657
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,597
"I'm asking one favor. One!

658
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,766
I've got other stuff to do!

659
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:49,269
My <i>Hielocos </i>are not going
to step into the fridge on their own!"

660
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:54,149
The problem with women's tops
is they're not like these.

661
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,277
They have buttons, ties, zippers...

662
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,489
Gentlemen, how many of you haven't been
in this scenario for at least 30 minutes?

663
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,158
Your girl, your lady, your princess

664
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:06,203
with her tits hanging out like,
"No, pull the zipper down!

665
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,040
Pull it down! No!
You're going to break it! Not like that!

666
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,792
Okay, I'll take it off!"

667
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,795
They make you feel like a moron.

668
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,259
"There! Easy! See?"

669
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,554
"Without looking." And you're like...

670
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,061
"Yeah, it does look easy."

671
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,064
That's what they
should teach us in school.

672
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,150
Any kids here,
ask your teacher how to undo...

673
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,943
And you'll learn more.

674
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:42,823
With the education I got,
with the education I grew up with,

675
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,869
my friends were pretty much like me,
kind of like...

676
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:48,996
tacky.

677
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,915
We'd relate to each other.

678
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,168
"Hey, motherfucker."
That's how we'd greet each other.

679
00:45:55,878 --> 00:46:01,508
And I had the amazing experience
of going to tacky kids' parties.

680
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,927
Don't laugh. I'm serious.

681
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,640
For her, it's like a fantasy.
"Come on, it'll be fun."

682
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,726
That was my day to day.

683
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,230
Parties where they had
triangular sandwiches, you know?

684
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,524
Wrapped in napkins.

685
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,611
And you didn't know why
they were always moist.

686
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,489
You would take one and be like...

687
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,831
"I'm coming!"

688
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,127
"Oh, fuck it." And you'd eat it like that.

689
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,880
You'd be spitting all day long.

690
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,424
"You're it!"

691
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:48,138
If there are parents
who have a kids' party coming up,

692
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,849
please be careful
because you always fuck it up.

693
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:55,103
You do stupid shit like the bouncy castle.

694
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:59,983
You always set it up like,
"Where's the sun? That's where it goes.

695
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,655
Put fabric under it. If the sun moves,
we can move the castle...

696
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,741
and it can be scolding hot
all fucking day."

697
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,078
Your dad would tell you to jump in,
and you'd be like, "Ah, it burns!"

698
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,705
What a stupid thing.

699
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:18,210
Then there's the trampoline,
something I only liked if I was alone...

700
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,839
because there was always an asshole kid

701
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,091
that would jump at the same time as you...

702
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,636
and fuck up your knees and your back.

703
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,974
The same kid that said,
"I offered my house for the project."

704
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,726
You're jumping and then...

705
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,815
You'd fall and everybody kept jumping.

706
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:44,570
"Stop! Please! I'm getting dizzy!
I want to get off!"

707
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,488
And they just kept jumping.

708
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,157
Thank you.

709
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:59,084
You wanted to get off
and the edge would give you a shock.

710
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,378
But a shock that could charge an iPhone.

711
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:04,423
You'd get off like...

712
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,927
"Where are my shoes?

713
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,347
Ma'am, have you seen my shoes?"

714
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,475
And you're barefoot
for the whole damn party.

715
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:21,523
Parents love bringing characters we love,
like Darth Vader, the Power Rangers.

716
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,943
Don't do that.
As a kid, you look up to these characters.

717
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,905
Darth Vader is the ruler of the galaxy.
He killed children.

718
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,948
The last thing I expect is to see him
leaving my bathroom saying,

719
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,992
"Are you having a good time, Carlitos?"

720
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,119
No.

721
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:38,999
Then they hire clowns or magicians
with inappropriate names.

722
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,002
"The clown with huge balls."

723
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:48,175
And they play stupid games. Like when they
ask you to bring your dad's shit to them.

724
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,346
"The first one to bring back a belt wins.

725
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:58,393
The first kid to bring back a set of keys
will win a prize!"

726
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:02,105
So there you are,
like an idiot looking for your dad.

727
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,900
You finally see your dad
and run up to him. "I want the keys!"

728
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,947
"Dad, do you have the keys?"

729
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,823
And you dad is like...

730
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,078
"Crap, your mom has them."

731
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,914
And you're like, "Fuck you!"

732
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,084
You go to your mom.
"Mom, you got the keys?"

733
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,502
And she's like...

734
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,799
"Thanks, boss."

735
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,679
"Hey, have you seen my shoes?"

736
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:39,101
You run back and you win.
You win a fucking balloon.

737
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,355
There were free balloons in the back,
but they gave you one as a prize.

738
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:50,612
We have another very stupid,
very dangerous game, musical chairs.

739
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:56,576
This awful game where the clown
put kids around a line of chairs.

740
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:01,415
And you're like,
"One, two, three, four, five, six...

741
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:06,253
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Holy shit!

742
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,757
Maybe I counted wrong. Let's see.
One, two, three, four...

743
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,135
Mr. Clown!

744
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,513
I know you're the one
with the balls, but...

745
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,682
you can't fool me.

746
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,351
Either we're missing a chair,
or there's an extra kid!

747
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,229
I might be nine years old,
but I've seen things."

748
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:28,692
And they would play
a fucking stressful song for that crap.

749
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,987
The chairs are just sitting there,
and you realize

750
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,532
this is the first time you're taught
to value something you didn't before.

751
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:39,828
You want that chair
only because someone else wants it, too.

752
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,706
There were other chairs at the party,
but you wanted that one.

753
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,000
And you're like...

754
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,129
"Come on, Daniel. You've got this."

755
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,719
You give your baby Jesus a kiss.

756
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,638
And you start.

757
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,059
And the fucking stressful song starts...

758
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,441
And suddenly, it kind of stops,
but not really.

759
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:15,614
"Motherfucker!
Go play jokes on your mama."

760
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:19,242
You're all pissed off, looking
at the chairs, and the songs stops.

761
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:23,080
You think, "I got this. There's the chair.
Here's my ass, I'm sitting down."

762
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,833
And they pull the chair out
from under you!

763
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,128
The fat chick from Duck Duck,
she pulled it away.

764
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:36,343
You'd fall on your ass and get an itch
in your throat. I don't know why.

765
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:42,849
That's dangerous.
Why do we keep doing these types of games?

766
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,269
Imagine a kid getting paralyzed
because of that shit.

767
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,981
Imagine he makes it on a telethon
when he grows up.

768
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:54,611
And they're telling his story.
"Well, we're here with...

769
00:51:54,694 --> 00:52:00,033
Mr. Andrés, who, well...
has been paralyzed since he was eight.

770
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,455
Mr. Andrés, tell us how this happened."

771
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,251
"Thank you. Well, when...

772
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,296
It was..."

773
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:26,893
"We were at Carlos' party...

774
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:32,566
when the clown with the huge balls
told us..."

775
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,527
And suddenly, the host starts dozing off.

776
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,028
"We were...

777
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,408
Yeah, don't worry about it.

778
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,079
We started playing musical chairs and...

779
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,877
we agreed to play.

780
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,547
And the irony of it all...

781
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,135
is we played musical chairs
and I'm still sitting!"

782
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,889
Thank you very much!
I'm Daniel Sosa.

783
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,267
Thank you!
