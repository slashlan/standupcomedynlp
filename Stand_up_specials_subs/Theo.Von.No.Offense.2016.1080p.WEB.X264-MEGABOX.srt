1
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,680
Yo, Theo, they all ready for you, bro.

2
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,683
Awesome, how do I look? Smart?

3
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,768
Appreciate the honesty.

4
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,479
-Do it, huh?
-Go get 'em.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:27,569
[announcer] <i>With no further ado,
ladies and gentlemen, Theo Von!</i>

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,545
New Orleans!

7
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:51,510
Yes, indeed.

8
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,388
How we doin', Crescent City?

9
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,973
[applause]

10
00:00:58,934 --> 00:01:02,021
Good to be home, baby.
Good to be home!

11
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:06,608
My buddy said, "Dang, you going down
to New Orleans to shoot your special?"

12
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:08,402
I said, "Yeah!"

13
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:12,072
He said, "What about that crime?"
I said, "Yeah."

14
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,825
He said, "You might get murdered."
I said, "Yeah."

15
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,746
"But where else you want
to get murdered, baby?"

16
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,123
I don't wanna get gunned down
in Cleveland.

17
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:26,837
I don't wanna get gunned down in Seattle.
Murder me in New Orleans, baby!

18
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,923
Right off the French Quarter,

19
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:33,552
with a stripper on my arm
and a fried shrimp in my mouth!

20
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,723
Good to be here, man.

21
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,308
I love this city,
and it is dangerous as hell.

22
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:45,439
Last time I was here,
I got bit by a black widow in March.

23
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,441
She was in her 40s.

24
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,152
At this bus stop, man.
Right off Canal, bro.

25
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,363
Got me right in the neck, son.

26
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,365
These bitches is accurate.

27
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:02,330
Been a tough time, man.
Been a tough year... family stuff.

28
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,749
You know, always, man.

29
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,962
My uncle just got busted for, uh, uh...

30
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,838
[inhales]

31
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,382
sucking really small dicks.

32
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,348
Yeah, they got him.

33
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:27,272
He was my favorite uncle, man.
He taught us how to masturbate, actually.

34
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:29,149
He didn't touch us
or anything like that.

35
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,736
He just stood up and jerked off
into the fire at this party.

36
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,325
I wasn't gonna say anything.
It was his party.

37
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:43,204
Sometimes you just got to sit there
and be a Christian.

38
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,088
But in his defense, my uncle's had
a lot of issues in his life.

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,841
He used to masturbate in his sleep.

40
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,802
So... I'm not joking, man.

41
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,472
So they made him wear these
jingle bells on his wrists.

42
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,896
But some nights
you would hear him in the other room,

43
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,940
dashing through the snow.

44
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:15,112
You know what I'm saying,
jerking his own dick off.

45
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:20,367
I'd make requests.
"Play 'Rudolph' Uncle Danny!"

46
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,286
"Y'all go to bed!"

47
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,041
You telling me this musical masturbator
doesn't take requests?

48
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:30,544
What kinda family is this, bro?

49
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,547
This family tree
got haters in the branches.

50
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,596
Lot of child molesters out there?

51
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,515
No offense if you're in the game.

52
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,521
And now, it's like a big deal, I feel
like, if you get molested, you know.

53
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:53,650
There's Child Services, it gets
on the news, it gets on the Internet.

54
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,486
Like, when I was young,
you just got molested.

55
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,657
Remember that, bro?
Remember the '80s, dude?

56
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:03,744
You just got molested!

57
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,581
You got a milkshake and a ride somewhere.

58
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,500
That was your end of the deal.

59
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:16,215
When I was young, if you got molested,
you just got back on your bike

60
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:20,177
and said, "Well, we ain't
coming around here anymore.

61
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:23,097
Nothing but dick around here."

62
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:30,812
Look, if I got a dollar for every time
I got molested...

63
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:35,483
I'd have like,
four dollars and 50 cents.

64
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:39,113
'Cause I got in this oral
pyramid scheme by the Denny's.

65
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:48,663
Parents, you gotta be careful
when it comes to these kiddy-touchers.

66
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:52,375
You gotta be careful when it comes
to these kiddy-touchers.

67
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,421
You can't be getting your son
all fixed up.

68
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,757
You can't be getting your boys lisp fixed.

69
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,385
Get his acne tightened up.
Get the pro-action on him.

70
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,304
Get his limp fixed.

71
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,144
And then be shocked when he gets
picked by the kiddy-touchers!

72
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,854
Fuck, you got him all G'd out.

73
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:20,695
You know who ain't getting picked,
is little Ch-Ch-Charlie's ass, okay?

74
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,364
Who still got his lisp,
who got his acne,

75
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,661
who got a wrap his bad leg around his
good leg when he wanna go somewheres.

76
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,414
Nobody touchin'
little Ch-Ch-Charlie's ass.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,335
You gotta think like the enemy.

78
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,049
Save your money, give it to your boy
in a lump sum when he's 18.

79
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:45,262
Let himself G'd out
when he's out of the danger zone.

80
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,974
Think about life.

81
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,482
Good to be home, man, I was born
about eight blocks from here, bro.

82
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:00,861
So it's nice, man.
I had an interesting family growing up.

83
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:03,780
My father was 70 years old
when I was born, okay.

84
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,741
True story. I'm not joking,
my dad was born in 1910.

85
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,743
I was born in 1980.

86
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,538
Which basically makes me
a stand-up comedian.

87
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,292
It was kinda cool growin' up
with a dad in his 70's,

88
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:18,461
because of the time we would spend.
Shortly after I was born,

89
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,462
my dad had a stroke.

90
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,341
So, we were both learnin' to walk
at the same time.

91
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,595
We used to play games like catch or don't.

92
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,936
And my favorite: "Is Dad sleeping,
or is he no longer with us?"

93
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,232
"It's your turn to hold
the mirror under his nose."

94
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,818
My mom used to make us hold a mirror
under his nose when he was taking a nap

95
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,904
to see if it would fog up or not.

96
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,488
I swear to God, not joking.

97
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:49,492
And the kids at school would be like,
"Well, my dad could beat up your dad."

98
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,870
I'd be like, "No shit, man."

99
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:55,498
Your dad has more organs than my dad...

100
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,752
but my dad used to bang your grandmother.

101
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:04,465
Back before they had protection,
when all you wore was hope.

102
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:10,097
"You got any condoms?"
"No, but I got this here."

103
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,515
That's that Alabama birth control, baby.

104
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,604
And it's crossin' state lines.

105
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,816
And my friends are like, "Theo, you
shouldn't make fun of your conception.

106
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,112
You should be happy you were born.
You were that lucky sperm."

107
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,613
I'm like, "Lucky sperm?

108
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,824
I shot out of a 70-year-old cannon, bro."

109
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,327
I was the only sperm.

110
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,416
I had to shut down the nuts.
I had to close all the windows,

111
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,667
fuckin' sweep up.

112
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,174
On the way out,
I passed a skeleton of a sperm

113
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:49,970
wearing a "Vote for
Lyndon B. Johnson" button.

114
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,600
That's not an orgasm.
That's musket fire.

115
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,355
So when I say I'm happy
to be somewhere, I'm just happy to be.

116
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,689
Anywhere.

117
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,777
Except at Denny's. They a bunch
of child molesters over there.

118
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,114
Y'all got Denny's here?

119
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,615
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

120
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,367
Fuck Denny's, bruh.

121
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,494
Fuck Denny's, man.

122
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,456
I wish people would quit
shootin' up movie theaters

123
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,958
and shoot up a fuckin' Denny's, okay.

124
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,210
'Cause if you get gunned up
at a Denny's,

125
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,463
that's on you, playboy.

126
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:29,176
Have some respect and take your family
to IHOP like a real man.

127
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,805
Denny's suck. Everything at Denny's
tastes like eggs and onions.

128
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,223
Everything.

129
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,558
The air, the pie,

130
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,104
even the silverware if you
just run in there and lick 'em.

131
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,981
That place is a shithole.

132
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,567
What do they clean the tables with?
Syrup?

133
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,863
Like once you sit down,
you can't even get up.

134
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,615
"Guess we're staying for lunch.
I'm trapped!"

135
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,538
And all the waitresses look like shit
at every location.

136
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,040
How do they do it?

137
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,793
They even have a job application?

138
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:08,589
Or they just have like a special mirror,
and if you look like shit...

139
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,301
then you're on staff, Cynthia.

140
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,678
But you gotta wear a hat,

141
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:17,098
'cause nothing looks better
than shit in a hat!

142
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,643
"Put on your hat, shitty. Waffle up."

143
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:24,689
Fuckin' hate Denny's, bro.

144
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,484
And half the waitresses got whiskers.

145
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,279
Would you shave your ladies, Denny?

146
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,991
Shave your ladies before
you put them on the dance floor.

147
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,743
Lady look like a damn cat.

148
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,954
"Meow! Meow!
Meow-come to Denny's!

149
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,706
[cat sounds]

150
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,666
Sorry for the bad service.

151
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,129
I just gave birth to a bunch of babies
in a cardboard box in the kitchen.

152
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,965
And we's all out of milk."

153
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,633
Fuckin' hate Denny's, bro.

154
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,636
I hate Denny's,
and I keep going back there!

155
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,805
I keep going back.

156
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,642
This me every time I leave Denny's.
"Man, fuck this place, man."

157
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,645
A week later,
"Yes, ma'am, table for one, please.

158
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,856
By the window?
Yes, ma'am, thank you. Yeah.

159
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:10,360
In case there's a drive-by,
I go down with this shithole.

160
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:11,445
Thank you."

161
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,448
Fuckin' hate Denny's, man.

162
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,825
Oh, I don't know why
it just makes me so mad.

163
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:20,912
I gotta quit going, man.
I'm gonna quit.

164
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,458
I used to go a lot 'cause
my ex-girlfriend lived by a Denny's,

165
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,126
'cause she was a drug addict.

166
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,294
And...

167
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,921
and so, I used to go there
and use the shitters,

168
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,299
'cause I didn't wanna use 'em
by her house.

169
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,967
So I'd go use Denny's shitters.

170
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,177
But not anymore, man.
Fuck that, dude.

171
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:39,514
I'll shit outside, son,
like one of God's boys. Turn up.

172
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,231
What else is going on, man?

173
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,234
Just been chasin' these hos, really.

174
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,862
No offense, hos.
Just trying to meet a good lady.

175
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,948
I see some of y'all got one.
Good on you.

176
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,825
Some lovely ladies here tonight.

177
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,120
It's tough, you gotta have money
these days to get a woman.

178
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,871
And I don't blame you ladies.

179
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,374
Who wants to fuck some poor guy?

180
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,209
That's nasty.

181
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:15,091
You get done banging,
you're just laying there all poor.

182
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:20,096
"Can I get you a towel that won't match
any of the other towels?

183
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,183
What about some chips?

184
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,520
Wanna split a bag of chips with daddy?

185
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:31,732
Some chips, baby. Wanna calorie up
after that bang, wildcat?"

186
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:37,197
Gotta have money to get the ladies, man.
You gotta have nice shit.

187
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,450
I don't have nice shit.
I got the other shit.

188
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,243
I don't have a nice apartment.

189
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:46,914
This is how I cheat, I put all my
nicest stuff right by the door, right?

190
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,209
So it looks nice when you come in.

191
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,462
"Yeah, just step over that new toaster!

192
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:53,796
Nice!

193
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,468
Just set your purse
by that <i>Sopranos </i>box set.

194
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,136
Haters welcome."

195
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,098
-[audience member] Yep!
-I don't have a nice car.

196
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,519
I have that car where you act like you
don't remember where you parked,

197
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,896
but you're standing
right next to your car.

198
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,192
And when nobody's looking,
you fuckin' get in and you escape.

199
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,070
It looks like you're stealing
your own car.

200
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,366
You tell your friends it's a rental.

201
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,994
They're like, "They're renting
'97 Accords to people?"

202
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,418
Like, "Yeah, I'm just driving
it for charity, actually, yeah.

203
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,338
Yeah, every time I floor it,
a blind boy can see four seconds.

204
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,131
So he gets that pop, you know.

205
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:41,428
So, I get a lot of speeding tickets,
you know, for his little dark ass."

206
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,224
No offense, if anybody is blind either.

207
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:50,687
My friend Maurice is blind,
and he said it ain't that bad in there.

208
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,318
But you gotta have money
to get the ladies.

209
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,572
If you don't have money, you gotta have
the other money: drugs.

210
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,741
Especially in L.A.,
man, that's where I live now.

211
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,118
Them girls out there
a bunch of coke-ghosts.

212
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,578
That's what I call them.

213
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:09,122
Coke-ghosts, baby,
'cause they're invisible.

214
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,499
They don't answer your calls,
your texts,

215
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,918
but you break out
a little bag of snow-caine,

216
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,296
they fuckin' show up
out of thin air.

217
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,880
Like, "Blow!

218
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,301
Blow!"

219
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,803
Then they're angry when you wanna
get 'em in the sheets.

220
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,557
I'm like, "Bitch, you're a ghost!

221
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:30,310
This is your natural attire.

222
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,810
Now come to daddy."

223
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:36,815
And if you don't have money or drugs,
you gotta be yourself.

224
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,069
Fuck that, man.

225
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,740
Last thing I'm doing is being myself.
Not on my watch!

226
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,244
What am I gonna say to a girl?
"Hey, my name is Theo.

227
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,498
Mostly, I just Netflix
and keep my hopes up."

228
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,128
You'll be alone forever!

229
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,675
But these days you don't have to be
yourself 'cause they have Internet.

230
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,259
You can be whatever you want.

231
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,886
You could be a pineapple.
You could be dead.

232
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,474
You can be whatever you want, man.

233
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,392
I met a girl recently online.

234
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,020
I hit her up,
I said, "Let's get some coffee."

235
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,897
So, she write me back.
She said, "Coffee's boring.

236
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,485
Didn't you read my profile?
I'm adventurous.

237
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:25,156
I wanna go skydiving on our first date."
[whines]

238
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:31,871
And nowhere in my budget is there
skydiving-for-unknown-bitches money.

239
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:38,419
That shit ain't hittin' my bottom line.
I keep unknown bitches at sea level.

240
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,341
So, I wrote her back.
I said, "Well, listen here, fancy,

241
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,803
I happen to live
on the 11th floor of my building.

242
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:52,350
Why don't you come over here,
I'll assist you off the balcony

243
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,268
in a windbreaker.

244
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,605
If you're still feeling all adventurous
down on the flower beds,

245
00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:00,692
I'll get your newly-crippled ass
a coffee, then.

246
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,236
But the caffeine ain't gonna
save your legs,

247
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,738
you greedy little gremlin."

248
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,614
And now I'm angry.

249
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:10,326
Now, I'm angry at a woman
that I've never even met.

250
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,952
Thanks, Internet!

251
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:17,333
Do you know what it's like to be angry
at bitches you don't even know?

252
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,627
My buddy Sherman's like,
"What's wrong?"

253
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,920
I'm like, "This bitch!"

254
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,631
He's like, "Who?"
I'm like, "I don't know!

255
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,718
Invisible bitches, Sherman!

256
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,764
She's a skydiver.
Let's wait for her ass."

257
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,143
"How will we know when she gets here
if she's invisible?"

258
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,771
"I don't know!

259
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:41,566
Wait till you feel 'bitch' in the air.
That's probably her!"

260
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,945
He's like, "Relax, Little Bear.
You need to go to yoga, Little Bear."

261
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,698
"Quit fuckin'
callin' me 'Little Bear,' Sherman.

262
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:51,117
Little bears ain't in their 30s,
you idiot."

263
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,831
I get frustrated, man.

264
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,041
I get frustrated real easy, you know.

265
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,294
You ever get frustrated, man?

266
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,671
-[man] All the time.
-How do you relax?

267
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:07,174
You don't? [laughing]
Okay, right on.

268
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,553
You just gon' keep
stressing till you pop, huh?

269
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,221
That's one way to do it, man.

270
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,890
Gets you to heaven.

271
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,185
But, yeah, it's hard, man,
it's hard to relax.

272
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,481
I'm not good at it, man.

273
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:25,025
I tried the marijuanas. I know a
lot of people's on the marijuanas.

274
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,569
And I'm not good at 'em, man.

275
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,447
I get high, I just get real paranoid,
you know?

276
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,742
It's like my whole head
turns into a haunted house.

277
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,788
I'm like, "What the fuck was that?

278
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,081
Oh, an idea.

279
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,713
This shit's strong, man."

280
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:49,383
Then I tried yoga.
I don't know if you've been to yoga.

281
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,595
I don't know if you've been to this deal.
Okay?

282
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,723
If you haven't been, it's like...

283
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:59,602
It's like fuckin',
but by yourself, real slowly.

284
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,314
And it's awkward
'cause all the ladies in there

285
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,859
are sweatin' out of their crotches
a little bit.

286
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,695
What is the deal, ladies, huh?
Somethin' bit you?

287
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,864
What happened, huh?

288
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,365
What is going on?

289
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,076
Put a little powder in your pants
before you go in there. Starch up!

290
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,872
Starch up, drink a Red Bull, "G" up!

291
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,458
What, you hide an armpit in your crotch?
Get your life together!

292
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,627
Huh? Huh?

293
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,505
Wear a cup, we don't care.
Just get it together.

294
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,466
What if I went around
just frothing at the balls all day

295
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,345
like I had a little St. Bernard
living behind my nuts?

296
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:36,597
"Get back there, buddy.
Get back there."

297
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,476
"G" up, ladies.

298
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:45,982
They need to quit marketing yoga to dudes.
Yoga ain't for dudes.

299
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:49,151
"Hey, bro, want to do a bunch of shit
you couldn't do?"

300
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,446
"Fuck, no, you creep."

301
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:57,076
Touch my feet.
I ain't touching my feet.

302
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,707
That's why God put 'em down there,
so I wouldn't be messing with 'em,

303
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,417
you little sinner.

304
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,794
Yoga ain't for dudes, man.

305
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:10,882
If my grandfather walked in on six of
his friends stretching at the same time,

306
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,175
he'd hit 'em with a fucking shovel, okay?

307
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,802
This shit ain't Christian!

308
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:18,097
"You men are stretching and don't
even know each other's names!

309
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,892
What are you doing?
Look at your life!"

310
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,107
Then they have some guy
who works in the yoga studio.

311
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,485
He looks like he got fired
from a Renaissance fair.

312
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,947
He's like, "You're doing a great job."

313
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,240
I'm like, "Who in the fuck are you?"

314
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,700
He's like, "Open your hip."

315
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,994
"I'll shit on your linoleum.

316
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,081
I will shit in here, bro.

317
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,791
I shit places, okay?

318
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,085
Don't make me make this one of 'em."

319
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,379
Yoga ain't for dudes.

320
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,384
You want a yoga class for dudes,
here's the class, all right?

321
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,804
It's called "Simon Says Don't Fart."

322
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,597
That's the class.

323
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,225
It lasts three minutes.
Every man farts, admits to it,

324
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,770
introduces themselves to the other men
in the room,

325
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,480
looking them square in the eyes,

326
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,983
and leaves out of there
with Christ in his heart.

327
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,112
Not this other cat factory
they're runnin'.

328
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,494
I hate fartin'.

329
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,413
I do. I always have.

330
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,416
I always have, okay?

331
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,335
I just hate it. I just don't--

332
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,546
I can't believe it, man.

333
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,967
Can you believe we're still fartin'?
We're farters.

334
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,137
We think we know somethin'?
We're farters.

335
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:43,474
We have air flyin' out of
our ass when it wants to.

336
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,935
What the fuck, people?

337
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,147
I have an app on my phone
that can take my blood pressure,

338
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,859
but my asshole's
still livin' in the Wild West.

339
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,322
If Apple would spend
a half hour on our sphincters,

340
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,825
we wouldn't have this problem!

341
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,743
Bring back Jobs!

342
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,041
I hate farting, man.

343
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,837
It's like your booty
trying to tell everybody all your secrets.

344
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,049
It's like, "Don't smell that,
you'll know everything!"

345
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:21,428
The worst is when you're by yourself,
living life at your house,

346
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,014
and you're alone in the living room

347
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,725
and you fuckin' cut a little bud
up into the air, son,

348
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,060
'cause you know what's up,

349
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,269
'cause you're probably going to heaven.

350
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:33,900
Then somebody comes in the room
'cause they wanna "tell you somethin'."

351
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:37,319
Now you gotta smell it all up
before they get close to you like--

352
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,532
[inhaling, exhaling]

353
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,910
"Hey, Danny!"

354
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,120
You try to talk so loud, they can't smell.

355
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:47,830
"How are ya?

356
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,291
Let's go talk by the wall.
We never do that!

357
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:56,255
Let's chat outside.
It's raining? Who cares! We're young!"

358
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,592
I hate fartin'.

359
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,306
We gotta beat it, man.

360
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:08,893
We gotta beat it.

361
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,354
I think we will.

362
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,151
Who even invented fartin'?
You ever ask yourself?

363
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,904
Or you're just fuckin' fartin',
you creeps.

364
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:26,452
Probably somebody from Mississippi, okay?

365
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,622
I don't know if you guys
have ever been to Mississippi or not.

366
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:34,085
If you haven't, let me save you
a little bit of travel cash, okay?

367
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:36,963
Go home, urinate in your toilet,

368
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,132
and then get in there with it.

369
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:43,510
"Ooh! Mississippi!"

370
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:47,140
That place is a shithole, man.

371
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:52,352
They need to give it to the Palestinians
and solve a damn world problem, okay?

372
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,231
They still have slaves there!

373
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,358
I was there a month ago,
I'm pumpin' gas at the gas station,

374
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,069
a brother pops out of the bushes,

375
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,405
he's like, "You got any news
from the North?"

376
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:06,533
Like, fuck this place, dude!

377
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:11,497
We need to get Morgan Freeman
out of there and then bomb that place.

378
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:16,043
Not with bombs, but somethin'
that'll really scare 'em: books!

379
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,338
[shouting] "Algebra!"

380
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,176
Fuckin' hate Mississippi, man.

381
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,678
No offense if you're
from Mississippi either.

382
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,601
I don't know anymore, man.

383
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,189
I just don't know
what God wants us to do.

384
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,694
[sighs]

385
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,655
So then I decided
I gotta get off the Interwebs.

386
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:47,491
I was trying to meet a woman
on the Interwebs.

387
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,910
Electrical humans.

388
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:53,747
And I said I gotta meet a woman
the old-fashioned way. People interaction.

389
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,750
I said I'm gonna ask out
the next woman that I see

390
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,711
to practice asking a woman out,

391
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,504
to practice ridin' the bike,

392
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,422
'cause I forgot what it was like.

393
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:05,509
So I met a girl,
she had a brown tooth.

394
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,427
Just one, haters.

395
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,139
But I'm a Christian.

396
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,934
I'm gonna see the rest of her,
see what else the Lord has built

397
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:17,521
around this little shantytown
in her mouth,

398
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,774
around this little neck Bethlehem.

399
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:25,988
I don't know her life. Maybe she got hit
by something brown right in the tooth.

400
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,033
Maybe somebody had something brown
and they threw it somewhere

401
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,827
and she was somewhere
and she got hit by it.

402
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,205
Okay. I don't know her life.

403
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,623
"Knock, knock." "Who's there?"
"Her life."

404
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,125
"I don't know you, bro."

405
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,296
So I asked her out, right?

406
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,049
[laughing] She said no.

407
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,053
I was like, "You've got a brown tooth,
lady!

408
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:51,389
Your face is dying!

409
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,224
Your face is dying, okay?

410
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,476
You's a couple candies
from being a jack-o'-lantern,

411
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,937
you little sugar hooker.

412
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,318
At least let me take you out
for a salad, girly.

413
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,195
Get some baby carrots
in your mouth.

414
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:11,409
Get some vitamins in your system.
Get your grill back on its feet."

415
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,202
'Cause who am I supposed to ask out,

416
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:17,373
if somebody whose face
is rottin' off their body is saying no?

417
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,584
Huh? A headless woman?

418
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,045
Where am I gonna meet
a headless woman, huh?

419
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:27,967
A headless woman who just wears her hat
on her neck stub and goes to the bank?

420
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:32,430
How am I supposed to be romantic
with a headless woman?

421
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,015
We're at a nice restaurant,

422
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,601
I'm just cutting a little piece
of steak and just...

423
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,895
just shaking them into her neck hole?

424
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,564
It ain't right.

425
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:52,741
And I ain't being gay, man.
There's already too many gays out there.

426
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,576
How many gays are out there, bro?

427
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,955
-[man] A hundred million.
-No, not a hundred million.

428
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,040
Are you crazy, dude?

429
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:04,337
Bro, they would be--
They'd be under everything, man.

430
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:10,134
Bro, no. Not a hundred million.
Maybe eighty thousand.

431
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,136
Ninety thousand. Maybe.

432
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,847
With Obama in office, who knows?
He's probably...

433
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,433
buying gays from other countries, maybe...

434
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,853
Yeah. Probably gettin'
a bunch of Chinese gays soon.

435
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,105
We don't know, is what I'm saying.

436
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,109
We don't know how many people
this monkey bit, guys.

437
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,406
We got no idea.

438
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,659
And here's the kicker.
Science still thinks one monkey did this.

439
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,871
Uh, hello, science.
Couple of monkey's did this, okay?

440
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,666
No offense if you're gay either.

441
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:50,590
I mean, I'll probably suck a little dick
at about 80. Know what I'm saying, bro?

442
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,427
You suck a little dick at 80?

443
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,721
Come on man, you in?

444
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,391
Huh? What's it for? For suckin' dick!

445
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,142
At 80, bro?

446
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,394
You busy?

447
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:06,357
You're not doing nothing at 80,
just sitting by the window.

448
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,485
Wherever you go at 80,
they put you by the window.

449
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,445
"Put Pop-Pop by the window!

450
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,780
Pop-Pop's here,
put him by the window!"

451
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:16,158
They don't even fucking ask Pop-Pop.

452
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,785
Any fucking window,
they just wheel you over to it.

453
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,621
"That's Pop-Pop.
That's your window."

454
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:26,210
You ain't gonna wheel back one day
and huff your boy off once?

455
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,922
Add a little flavor to Pop-Pop's life.
Come on, man.

456
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,552
It's not gay at 80, bro. It's chill.

457
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:39,098
It's just like, "Grandpa is crazy.

458
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,683
But he's staying active."

459
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:47,481
What you worried about, the feeling?

460
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,442
You're not gonna feel it.

461
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,944
At 80, bro, you're not gonna feel it, man.

462
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,488
You've got no feeling left
in your mouth at 80!

463
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,949
All your feelings gone to heaven.

464
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,535
Everything just feel like a warm water.

465
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:03,372
Probably like somebody trying to sneak
a fish stick into your mouth.

466
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,874
"Who's trying to give me this fish stick?

467
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,377
Old Pop-Pop didn't order no fish sticks!"

468
00:27:09,462 --> 00:27:13,299
It's probably like eating a hot dog
that's fighting back a little.

469
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,136
Come on, man.

470
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:21,599
You afraid to suck a little dick?
That's the gayest thing I've heard.

471
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:27,729
You've changed, man.

472
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,568
Being gay has changed, man.

473
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,446
Being gay's changed.
Now gay dudes are just like, "I'm gay!"

474
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:38,324
That's fine. It's the way
it always should have been.

475
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:41,076
Let's not forget the OGs
of the game, baby.

476
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,829
Let's not forget
our fathers and stepfathers,

477
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,457
who'd meet up behind Shoney's
on their lunch break

478
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,585
and tug uglies and go back home
to their fucking families and kids.

479
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,878
Let's get a round of applause
for those men.

480
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,342
The OGs, baby. The Original Gays.

481
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:03,932
Some guys are too gay these days,
though, bro.

482
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,769
Super gays, the kind of gay dudes
where even my gay friends are like,

483
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,272
"This bitch needs to chill out a little."

484
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,027
This guy came up to me
the other day in L.A., man.

485
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:18,531
He had all his stuff
in an Easter basket.

486
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:23,494
He had his phone and monies
in an Easter basket.

487
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,455
And he said he's lost,
he needs directions.

488
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:29,249
I said, "I can't help you
get anywhere, bro,

489
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,252
not if you frikking
bringing your own Easter."

490
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:35,422
You can always find a super gay dude.

491
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:38,133
And it's always a frikking white dude.

492
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40,927
And he's always standing
somewhere like this.

493
00:28:41,011 --> 00:28:43,514
And he's always in
a troubled neighborhood.

494
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,599
And he's standing there like this.

495
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,936
[shivering]

496
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,983
Like people are beating him
with soft cold dicks,

497
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,486
but nobody's beating him
with soft cold dicks!

498
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,405
It's in his brains.

499
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,744
And he's got on Daisy Dukes,
but more Daisy than Duke. Okay?

500
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,039
And he's got bright white legs,
like, Boo-Radley white,

501
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,167
like tall sacks of soft cream
holding him up.

502
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,086
And he don't even look like a fellow.

503
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,756
He looks like a premature baby
somebody stretched up real tall

504
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,299
and put a little tank top on him.

505
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:21,927
And it looks like he don't even
have a spine in his body.

506
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,013
Like, in the morning
he was down like this in a little pile.

507
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,265
And then he just... [inhales]

508
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,601
caught a whiff of dick in the distance,

509
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:31,103
and it's been holding him up all day long.

510
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,189
Like, come on, bro.
That's super gay, right?

511
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,817
What if I went around just being
super fucking straight all day?

512
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:43,115
I just woke up and started throwing
footballs at hot bitches all day long.

513
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,660
Or eating raw meat
and shitting in race cars?

514
00:29:46,744 --> 00:29:48,746
They would take me to jail.

515
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:54,585
But bro-bro's doing BYO Easter,
and I gotta act like everything is normal?

516
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,670
Come on, man!

517
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:59,298
Just be regular gay, man.

518
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,342
You didn't win somethin'.

519
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,890
'Cause we've all been a little gay, bro.
You've been there? Just nod.

520
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,271
I've been gay, bro.
I'll tell you about it, man.

521
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,065
First time I was gay,
I was 11 years old, okay?

522
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,401
The only time that I was 11.

523
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,404
And I was at the movie theater
in my town.

524
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:25,073
I grew up in a small town
called Covington, Louisiana,

525
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,785
not far from here, okay?
You know it?

526
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,829
Beautiful place, man. Beautiful place.

527
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,165
Lee Harvey Oswald
went to our middle school.

528
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:37,043
True story. Pistol Pete Maravich
lived and died in our town.

529
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:39,171
So... two good shooters.

530
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,718
Tulane University had their
primate testing facility center in town,

531
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,304
and in 1994, 70 infected monkeys got out,

532
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:51,183
and they let us out of YMCA summer camp
to help the police look for them.

533
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,812
So what the fuck
have you done with your life?

534
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,816
Until you and 11 kids
you barely know in wet bathing suits

535
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,486
have surrounded six chimpanzees
outside of a Kenny Rogers Roasters,

536
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,197
you probably really don't know yourself.

537
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,454
I'm at the movie theater in our town.

538
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,748
I'm there with my girlfriend.
She looked like a boy.

539
00:31:14,832 --> 00:31:18,585
But that's not the gay part of the story,
is it, conclusion-jumpers?

540
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,672
She looked like a boy because
they only had one haircut in our town

541
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:23,382
because Mr. Ray was our bus driver.

542
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:27,052
On the third Thursday of the month,
he would park the bus on the way home.

543
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,638
You had three dollars,
you would hold your money up.

544
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:30,972
He was also the barber.

545
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,392
He would clip everybody out
that had their monies up.

546
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:38,397
He only knew one hairstyle. It was kind
of like this Polish lesbian cut.

547
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,024
Anyway, that month me and my girl
had a bit of spending cash

548
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,069
and we were sitting at the movie theater.
Our shit's fresh.

549
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,825
Now, the movie that had come to town
was called <i>Pumpkinhead. </i>A scary movie.

550
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,993
It was a film built for fear.

551
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:54,496
So we're sitting there,
just ready to be scared.

552
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,750
There's an older boy sitting next to me.
He was 16 years old.

553
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,545
During the film, he got himself
a hand job from his girlfriend,

554
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:04,172
and he ejaculated onto my arm.

555
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,926
It was a pretty decent amount.

556
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:13,849
And I only had 11 years worth of arm
at the time, so it looked like more then.

557
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,142
But he really doused me up.

558
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:20,689
And I was like, "Holy shit, man.
They got me," you know?

559
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,524
"I'm gay."

560
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,651
So... I'm not joking, man.

561
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:28,697
For three months, I thought
I was a young homosexual. You know?

562
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:33,452
And I broke up with my girlfriend.
I started jogging.

563
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:41,293
And then I'm sitting there at Christmas,
I'm crying and wearing all these scarves.

564
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,586
I'm serious, man.

565
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:44,880
My brother is like,
"What the fuck, dude?

566
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,633
Mom's pissed
you're wearing all her scarves."

567
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,260
I was like,
"I'm a young homosexual, man.

568
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,930
We're just trying to live our lives."

569
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,348
He's like, "What are you talking about?"

570
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:59,686
"They were getting people
at <i>Pumpkinhead. </i>And they got me.

571
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,438
Where were you?"

572
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,816
He's like,
"I don't know if you're gay or not,

573
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:07,152
but you're the dumbest person
I've ever met in my life."

574
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,738
Then he beat my ass, actually.

575
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,239
Is that a hate crime?

576
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,827
I think I got hate-crimed, dude.

577
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,829
I knew I thought I got hate-crimed.

578
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:24,920
But here's the wild part of that story.
Here's where the Lord really steps in.

579
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,422
Because the fellow that got ejact
onto me...

580
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:30,175
he died.

581
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,930
He died. He died. He died. [repeats]

582
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,641
He died. He died...

583
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:42,061
He died in a car accident.
He died of natural causes by a car.

584
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,231
Sometimes I'll be sitting somewhere...

585
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,484
thinking or not thinking about something,

586
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,569
waiting for a thought
to come and find me.

587
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,990
And I'll feel like...

588
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,742
Let me say this right. I will feel like...

589
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,244
this is, like, his arm a little.

590
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:00,079
I swear to God, man.

591
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:04,584
Because I'll just be sitting there
doing nothing, or maybe doing something.

592
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:07,337
And my hand will go like that.

593
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,631
But I won't want nothing.

594
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,175
But it's like he wants something.

595
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:17,222
Like he trying to get something.
Like he wants a candy.

596
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,641
'Cause I wouldn't be
reaching for no candies

597
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:22,143
'cause I know we don't keep candies
in the house.

598
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:26,064
It's like he's reaching for a candy,
like, he trying to get a butterscotch.

599
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:37,116
The second time I was gay
was when I met Brad Pitt.

600
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,828
'Cause I met Brad Pitt, dude.
I did. I met Brad Pitt.

601
00:34:39,912 --> 00:34:42,622
The real one,
the only one God ever made.

602
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,042
Met his ass, okay?

603
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,502
This is what happened.
Listen up, haters.

604
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,463
So it's a beautiful day out.

605
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:55,218
'Cause Brad only lives on beautiful days.

606
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:59,222
And I'm walking. I'm going to
an audition on the Fox lot in Los Angeles.

607
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:03,476
Probably for a big movie like <i>League
of their Own II </i>or something heavy.

608
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,645
The sun is hitting me while I walk.

609
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:09,900
The rays are just coming down
and just touching me on my neck and hair.

610
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,820
Like the Lord just petting me,
letting me know I'm still his boy.

611
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:15,697
In the distance I see a man, right?

612
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,992
I say a man, but I'm talking about
the most beautiful woman

613
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,703
you've ever seen wrapped up in a man.

614
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:24,539
He didn't even look human.
He looked like...

615
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,710
Poseidon had been raising a secret
little baby boy down in the ocean.

616
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,545
And when that boy was full grown,

617
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:33,172
he set him on the land
and said, "Go, boy.

618
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,883
You live out there now."

619
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:38,261
Immediately, I was gay. Okay?

620
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,847
Like-- Poof-- Gay.

621
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:45,393
So, I'm walking and he's walking,
we're both going to the same building.

622
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:46,311
It's a true story.

623
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,772
I don't even know
if Brad Pitt even walks anymore,

624
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:52,025
or if there's an agreement now
between gravity and Mother Nature

625
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,526
and the grace of God,

626
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,072
where they just amicably move
little Bradley wherever he needs to go.

627
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,242
Like, God has a chessboard with one piece
and it's Brad-fucking-Pitt.

628
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,702
Checkmate life, right?

629
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,245
So, I'm walking, he's gliding.

630
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:07,124
We're both going to the same building,
I'm looking at him,

631
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,335
and I'm thinking to myself,
"Man, that looks like Brad Pitt."

632
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,797
And then my brain goes,
"'Cause that is Brad Pitt, playboy."

633
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,634
Part of my brain is black and gets
a little 'hood with the rest of my brain.

634
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:21,471
I don't know what to do now,
'cause they don't teach you what to do

635
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,765
when you're about to meet Brad Pitt.

636
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,851
They teach us other things.

637
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,937
If you're on fire, little buddy,
stop, drop and roll.

638
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:33,066
If you're going to argue with a short man,
don't argue with him in a prone position.

639
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:36,153
Argue with him like this
and be ready for his little actions.

640
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,406
But they don't teach you
how to meet Brad-frikking-Pitt

641
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,200
in Brad-frikking-person, right?

642
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:44,077
So I'm walking, he's gliding.

643
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,873
We're going to the same building,
me and the only Brad Pitt God ever made.

644
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,124
Brad Pitt.

645
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:52,210
And he was wearing--
He was wearing everything.

646
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,671
He had on, like, a tuxedo.

647
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,381
And he was on a horseback.

648
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,426
And he had on furs,
but, like, exotic furs.

649
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,514
Animals we've never even seen,
like, Chimpanebras and alapacakeets.

650
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,059
And he had Lorax
coming off his shoulders,

651
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:09,769
and he had Care Bear cuff
on his boot-tops and wrists.

652
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,105
And... he had no shirt on.

653
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,901
So he's coming from that way,
I'm coming this way.

654
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,527
Double doors on the building.

655
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,279
We get to the front of this building
at the same moment,

656
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,032
and I'm thinking to myself,

657
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:25,660
"I'll get the door,
'cause Brad's done a lot for me."

658
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:28,496
So I grab the door on the left
and I pull it.

659
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,249
You know how some asshole
always locks the door on the left?

660
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,668
That asshole works here. Okay?

661
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,670
So, I pull it and it's locked.

662
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:38,090
Usually, you would just
open the other door,

663
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,342
but for some reason,
I just keep pulling on this locked door

664
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:45,013
like it's gonna start up
and I'm-a mow the yard with it, right?

665
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:48,683
And Brad Pitt is standing right here.
The only one that God has.

666
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,186
And you can feel him
when he's standing somewhere

667
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,688
'cause he's got this invisible energy
comin' off him,

668
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:57,358
'cause he's made out of
vagina and diamonds.

669
00:37:57,442 --> 00:38:02,072
So, I'm pulling on this door and he goes,
"You got it, man?"

670
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,909
'Cause that's what Brad Pitt say
when shit ain't going well.

671
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,204
So I look back at him like this.

672
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:13,750
If you ever looked right at him up close,
it's like staring directly into the sun,

673
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,878
but with a little bit
of Brad Pitt in there.

674
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,547
I look back at him like this
and I say, "I got it, man."

675
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:22,050
That's what my brain said.
My mouth goes...

676
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:26,054
[stuttering]

677
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:30,058
Right to his face!
[stuttering]

678
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:37,107
Like an Asian that won't start.
[stuttering]

679
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:40,443
Thankfully he speaks [stuttering],

680
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,822
'cause he's been around social roaches
like your boy.

681
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:47,075
I gotta open door number two,
but I don't want this interaction to end.

682
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,453
We might hug, we might fuck a little.
This is Hollywood, son.

683
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:54,457
This is my chance
with Brad-frikkin'-Pitt, you animals.

684
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,293
So, door number two, okay?

685
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,544
Naturally,
I could just open that door,

686
00:38:58,628 --> 00:39:02,381
walk in this building,
let this man live his life.

687
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:07,012
Or I could open the door for him,
let him walk by and just live my own life.

688
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:08,972
But this is what I did.
I open the door.

689
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,640
As it swings open,

690
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,185
I jump across and put my back
against the open door.

691
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:16,896
Like, a way that people
don't open doors.

692
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,941
He looks at me like,
"That ain't how people open doors."

693
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:25,864
And I said, "I got it, man.
I used to work at a door store."

694
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,621
I'm not joking man,
I door-stored him.

695
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,457
Right to his face, dude.
Right to his Brad Pitt face.

696
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,169
And... and he goes...

697
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:40,378
"Ha-ha."

698
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,089
That's what he said.

699
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:44,757
"Ha-ha."

700
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,845
And I don't know
if you ever heard him laugh in person,

701
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,430
but I mean, it's beautiful.

702
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:56,435
You don't even hear it at first.
You just feel the laughter on your skin.

703
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,522
When you finally hear his laugh,
I mean, it just...

704
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,276
it sounds like a million babies
eating cookies at the same time.

705
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:07,739
Right when I heard his laugh,
crop circles formed in my hair.

706
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,326
And memories of making love
to a hundred women I never even met

707
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,245
starting living in my heart.

708
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,913
<i>Mi corazón.</i>

709
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:17,957
So I'm just standing there
against this door, right?

710
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:22,045
People are going in and out. I'm just
reduced to a concierge by this man.

711
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,881
This lady comes runnin' up,
this straight-up street beast,

712
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,760
and she's like,
"Did Brad Pitt just go in there?"

713
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,430
I was like, "No, ma'am.
He went thattaway," you know?

714
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,976
'Cause I ain't telling this bitch
where I keep him.

715
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,986
Thank you. Thank you.

716
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:53,576
And the third time I was gay
was just a general time.

717
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,955
When I was younger we used to play
a game called "gay chicken."

718
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,664
Anybody in the Navy?

719
00:40:59,124 --> 00:40:59,958
Uh...

720
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,252
<i>Homosexualis con pollo.</i>

721
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:09,592
It's like, you and your buddy stand there,
hold each other's penis, all right.

722
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,928
First person to let go is gay.

723
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:16,433
But, if you get an erection,
you're out.

724
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,770
So you got to play offense
and defense, bro.

725
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,485
The worst is when you start catching
their pulse a little.

726
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,863
"Why you pump faking, homie?
You pump faking."

727
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,452
You can't play with the brothers.
You use both hands...

728
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,703
hard on the back, L5-S1.

729
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:42,375
And you can't play with a Asian guy,
'cause you can't...

730
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,211
You just gotta pinky swear with it.

731
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,922
That's a different game,
that's called "broken promises."

732
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:50,633
That's for the young bucks.

733
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,677
That's for the young bucks, man.

734
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,763
I was 11-7 in '92 actually.

735
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,265
I was, man.

736
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:59,017
They shut us down, though.

737
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,146
Too many people watching.

738
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,939
Fire hazard.

739
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,945
I was having a tough time
meeting a good gal,

740
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,948
my buddy said,
"Let me set you up on a blind date."

741
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,535
I said, "All right man,
I can't drive my own life. You drive it."

742
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:22,790
So, he set me up, and I got there early,
I'm ready to fuck a little.

743
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:27,795
And I'm just waiting for this girl,
and then finally I see this girl.

744
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:31,924
I'm like, "Oh, man,
I could've met this bitch myself."

745
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,679
She was busted-looking, okay?
No offense if you're ugly.

746
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,890
But she looked busted-up.

747
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,351
She looked like she been
beaten up by animals.

748
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,603
She been on a new TV show
called <i>Bear Beatings.</i>

749
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,606
It was a two-part episode.
At the end of the first part,

750
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,194
it was like, "Will these bears
continue to beat this bitch?"

751
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:55,407
And the sequel was like, "These bears
are still beating this bitch!"

752
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,034
I'm not saying
I look like anything special.

753
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,288
I look like Patrick Swayze
and Shrek had a son. Okay?

754
00:43:02,372 --> 00:43:04,790
I look like The Grinch
That Stole Matt Damon.

755
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:11,214
<i>♪ You're a mean one, Jason Bourne ♪</i>

756
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,926
If you look at me from the side,
I look like I have bit of Down Syndrome.

757
00:43:17,262 --> 00:43:20,639
I can make that joke 'cause I actually
beat Down Syndrome in 1991.

758
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,059
I'm in remission.
Praise God, baby.

759
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,313
Amen.
That's where I'm from, dude.

760
00:43:27,397 --> 00:43:29,899
I'm from a neighborhood where if
you had a handicap,

761
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:34,153
you better get your shit together,
get back on the street and make money.

762
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:38,824
Toughest kid I've ever known was this boy
named Dairy, named after the food group.

763
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:40,868
He was, yogurt and all.

764
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,538
He had Down Syndrome,
wore a Scottie Pippen jersey

765
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:47,208
and a gold chain every day of his life
and carried a fucking gun, son.

766
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:49,794
"If he ain't got the money,
then pop, pop.

767
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,045
Pop-pop!"

768
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,508
I'm not joking, dude. He killed
seven pets in our neighborhood one year.

769
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,221
He killed seven pets, bro.

770
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,557
There ain't much you can do
when you got a DS fella

771
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,850
spraying off against animals.

772
00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:07,895
We would call the police. They'd say,
"Y'all can't call us. Call a church.

773
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,856
That boy is out of our jurisdiction,
praise God."

774
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:18,197
What was I talking about?
Oh, the girl on the date.

775
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,199
So, this girl looked wild, bro.

776
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,577
You know, visually freelance.

777
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,245
Um...

778
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,289
Her eyes were real far apart.

779
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,916
I don't know if that's
a new thing, ladies.

780
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,671
I'm old-fashioned, I like more
of a localized face. You know, just...

781
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:37,675
Just holdin' a little meetin'
by your nose, you know.

782
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,678
Her eyes were just real far apart,
you know,

783
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,722
like she wanted to be greedy
and see everything.

784
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,894
The last second, the Lord just went
"tink" with one of her eyes.

785
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:54,442
The whole time I'm talking to her,
I don't know which eye to look into.

786
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:57,362
I'll just look back and forth
into each eye,

787
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,823
like it's a threesome, but it's just us.

788
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:03,784
"So good to see you--
What the fuck?

789
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:05,953
Was your daddy a salmon?"

790
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,959
Ladies, if your eyes real far apart,
give your girlfriend an eye marker,

791
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,712
tell her to draw a little more eye
on the inside of each eye.

792
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,299
Or draw a third eye in the middle.

793
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:21,260
Play "guess which two I'm seeing out of"
with your mans.

794
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,346
Help each other out.

795
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,767
This lady had strong breath, too.
Kinda breath like-- "Whoo!

796
00:45:29,561 --> 00:45:30,853
Kill 'em!"

797
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,522
Strong, bro. Just like--

798
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:36,484
Like one of her lungs hooked
to her asshole. You're like, "Come on now.

799
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,194
Come on, Jannie, you're talking booty."

800
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,447
Strong, bro.

801
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,282
Made me nervous.

802
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:46,452
Ladies, if your friend have strong breath,
you have a responsibility.

803
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,163
Get a little handful of mints
or cinnamons.

804
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:53,042
Run by your friend,
throw them at her face like that.

805
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,671
Or be more secretive about it,
like that. Okay?

806
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,881
See if some get in her face holes.

807
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,925
Or get a syringe full of peppermint,

808
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,220
sneak up behind Smokey,
<i>Dexter </i>her in the neck.

809
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:08,266
Start at the roots, work your way up.
Help each other out, ladies.

810
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:13,396
Teamwork makes the dream work, okay?

811
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:19,736
This girl had a big head on her, too.
She real, real, real extra-headed.

812
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,572
I'm old-fashioned,
I like a regular-headed woman.

813
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,657
I like a basic think piece.

814
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:28,369
She was real extra-headed,

815
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:32,498
like her neck had been
in a go-catch-something-big contest.

816
00:46:32,582 --> 00:46:35,042
Hurry, you're missing all the big stuff!

817
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:37,712
Like the Lord had taken
her regular head off

818
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:41,758
and dipped it in some breading
and then put it back on her neck.

819
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,468
Made me nervous, man.

820
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:46,262
Why is my buddy even setting me up
with a big-headed girl?

821
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:49,098
I already have a big head.
What are we supposed to do?

822
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,016
Have a big-headed little child?

823
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,604
Can't even lift his beautiful
little bitty big-ass head.

824
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:56,855
It's too heavy for his body
to get off the ground.

825
00:46:56,939 --> 00:47:00,401
He gotta learn to crawl side to side,
around it.

826
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,321
He gotta play a clock
in all the school plays.

827
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:09,076
Don't hook somebody up with the same shit
they already have.

828
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,581
If you got a one-legged friend, don't hook
him up with another one-legged friend.

829
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:14,666
What do think?

830
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:18,961
They're just gonna lean against
each other somewhere where it's level?

831
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:23,341
Fuck no, man! Two people
need at least three legs!

832
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,927
Look at a leg chart, you animals!

833
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:34,185
And ladies, if you got a big head,
work your head out.

834
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,022
Do some laps around yourself, like that.

835
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:44,153
Put on some head Spanx.
Spank your head up.

836
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,489
Spank your head up, mama.

837
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,575
I don't know if you guys know
what a Spanx are, it's a special suit

838
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:52,077
they made for the ladies.
I think the Germans made it.

839
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:55,498
It pushes all their body
into their shoes, okay?

840
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:58,668
I call it "cramouflage."

841
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,714
But we don't notice that,
we just see the "ba-bow."

842
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,758
We don't see these tug boots,
carryin' the rest of 'em.

843
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:12,515
Like-- [boat-like sounds]

844
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:15,934
Goin' to the club.
[boat sounds]

845
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,103
We just see the "ba-bow," you know?

846
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:21,691
Look like a sweet little vase
you wanna put all your dick flowers in.

847
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,737
Then you get her home,
you crack off these Spanx,

848
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,698
it's like opening up
a can of refrigerator biscuits.

849
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:33,828
Like-- [popping]

850
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:45,214
Like, "I-I'm just gonna jerk off
in the can.

851
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:48,885
I'm tired, I got a headache.

852
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,680
My headache's tired.
I love you."

853
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,186
But we hooked up. Uh...

854
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:04,108
Sometimes you gotta take one for the team,

855
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,527
even if you was a free agent.

856
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,488
We hooked up, actually
I was worried I mighta got her pregnant

857
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:11,574
'cause the birth control
I was using,

858
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,658
aim...

859
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,454
doesn't always work so well, you know.

860
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,998
I didn't want to have a baby with her,
'cause I don't even know her,

861
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,709
which should hold up in court.

862
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:26,255
"Yes, Your Honor, this is our boy,
Headrick, but I don't know her."

863
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,008
Second of all, I didn't wanna have
a baby with her.

864
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,678
This is kind of vain.
She had, like, a crazy tooth.

865
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:35,556
You ever meet somebody
that have, like, a crazy tooth?

866
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,852
Like way up here. Like it auditioned
to be a horn, but didn't get it.

867
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,230
Way up here. Like, they smile
and then smile again,

868
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,316
and you're like, "What the fuck?

869
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,902
Where'd your grill get a balcony?"

870
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:52,030
Just way up here, hiding in the attic
like John Wilkes Tooth,

871
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,451
just ready to fuckin' pop out
and murder the president, son.

872
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,203
Murder! Murder!

873
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,874
And I didn't want our first baby
to have a special tooth

874
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,336
sprouting out of his neck or back,
little Shark Week-er.

875
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:09,590
Only get himself a job with the carnival,
working in a cage at night

876
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:12,050
opening up mail off
his sharpened head tooth,

877
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,304
doing special shows for businessmen.

878
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,101
My boy ain't workin' in no cage.

879
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,817
So we hooked up and...

880
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:31,445
afterwards we're just layin' there,
me and her.

881
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,865
Two children of the Lord,
done ate the apple.

882
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,743
I'm kissing her on her neck up in here,
where all the sweet is,

883
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,578
right here on the sugar shelf.

884
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:43,958
Just rubbing my hand on her like this,
just being real natural.

885
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:49,714
Like a gentleman.
Like a little husband.

886
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:54,927
Just like a little handicapped fellow
petting a scared sheep. You know, just...

887
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:58,639
"You quit shaking, Daisy,
that's just a storm coming, you see.

888
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:02,058
You just keep growing your wool out,
my little mitten-maker.

889
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:03,769
You want more Apple Jacks,
don't you?

890
00:51:03,853 --> 00:51:07,857
Don't you want more of daddy's
Apple Jacks, my little lady angel?"

891
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,568
Just being real chill with her.

892
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,446
And then I said,
"Are you on birth control?"

893
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,992
She said no,
and that's when I got real nervous.

894
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:21,077
Kind of felt like my heart
had to take a shit.

895
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,958
And then I was like,
"If you had a baby, would you keep it,

896
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:29,045
and would it be okay
if I just wrote y'all letters?"

897
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,756
'Cause women love getting mail.

898
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,008
And she goes,
"Actually, I can't conceive."

899
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,720
And that's when I started running around
the room high-fiving shit.

900
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,933
Just cheap shit she had on the walls,
like pictures of her family at the beach.

901
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,770
She's like, "Calm down, it's real sad.
I've had two miscarriages."

902
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,980
And that is very sad.
If somebody says that,

903
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:51,609
you're supposed
to hug them or buy them a plant.

904
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,071
When you're a comedian,
you don't think like that.

905
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:57,573
The devil trying to get your brain.

906
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:00,618
You say things you shouldn't say,
'cause the words go from your brain

907
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,579
right out of your mouth,
not through your heart first.

908
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,915
I was like,
"You've had two miscarriages?

909
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:09,668
I feel lucky my penis lived
after it was in there."

910
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:24,767
So that's what I've been doing.

911
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:28,604
They're just jokes, people!

912
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,108
It can't all be funny.

913
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:34,735
It can't all be funny.

914
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:43,577
And the Jews are clogging up the Internet.

915
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,207
That's all for that.

916
00:52:53,045 --> 00:52:55,673
I think it was easier to meet a woman
like in the old days.

917
00:52:55,756 --> 00:53:00,260
I don't know how old some of you are,
but maybe the 1800s or whatever.

918
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:03,597
Back then, you just walked out
of your house, if you were a man,

919
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,684
hundreds of miles if you had to,
till you saw any woman,

920
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,936
and you just started
walking back with her.

921
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,646
She's like, "Where are we going?"

922
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,773
You're like, "To the rest of your life."

923
00:53:13,482 --> 00:53:15,860
And that was a relationship.

924
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:18,863
And if she got out of line,
you took her on a warning hike.

925
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,784
And I'm not saying it was perfect,
I'm just saying that it worked.

926
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,662
And the man went out
and did the world work.

927
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,373
The woman stayed at home
and took care of family work.

928
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:33,460
I don't think it was ideal for anybody,
but the kids were fat, the cat was fed.

929
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,963
You got home, your wife
was there with the mail,

930
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,090
like, "Tell me what the mail says!"

931
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:44,930
And I'm not saying it was perfect.
I'm just saying that it worked.

932
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:48,517
And then women started
wanting to do everything.

933
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,603
"We wanna chew gum,
we wanna wear hats,

934
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,982
we wanna drive big rigs,
we wanna CrossFit."

935
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,861
"CrossFittin'?
What the fuck are y'all doing?

936
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,322
Y'all are doing chin-ups
in an abandoned shed all morning?

937
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:05,241
We're fucking starving at the house.

938
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,536
Our boy can't read.

939
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,123
And you're worried about muscle density?

940
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,292
When I married you, you had an ass.
Now you got glutes?

941
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,545
What are glutes?

942
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:20,007
Don't make that thing
any harder for daddy to get into."

943
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,429
And now they have a hundred machines
at the gym for women.

944
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:28,348
And now y'all probably
feel obligated to use them all.

945
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,476
When I was young, they had
four machines at the gym for ladies,

946
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,562
and three of them were stoves.

947
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:39,401
"I'm gonna do chest and tris.
Why don't you do that manicotti we love?"

948
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:45,281
And I'm not saying it was perfect.
I'm saying that it worked.

949
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,786
Here's what I really believe, ladies.

950
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:52,998
A lot of relationships don't work anymore
because opposites attract.

951
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:55,500
Ladies feel like
they have to do everything.

952
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,502
Gotta feel like a ton of pressure.

953
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,296
But if y'all are doing
all the women's and men's stuff,

954
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,216
what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

955
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:07,846
I have on facial moisturizer right now.
I don't know what's going on.

956
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:12,392
You got women doin' dead lifts all day,
wondering why they don't have a boyfriend.

957
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:14,310
'Cause you're it.

958
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:20,192
I don't wanna hug a woman
and come in second!

959
00:55:20,276 --> 00:55:22,527
You gotta be the lady.
Put down the barbells.

960
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:24,238
Pick up some flowers, look lost.

961
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,491
You'll have a boyfriend in five minutes.

962
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:36,167
We gotta stay in our own lanes.

963
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,543
The irony is we have enough
in common, ladies.

964
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,006
Women are always like,
"You men look good into your sixties.

965
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,926
We start falling apart in our thirties."
That's bullshit.

966
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,137
That's bullshit, man.

967
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:52,266
I'm in my 30s. My hip clicks
for the first hour of every day.

968
00:55:52,348 --> 00:55:55,727
Just... [clicking]

969
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:59,606
For no reason at all, I have a mating call
for women with osteoporosis

970
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,485
built into my body. Okay?

971
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:07,198
My body used to be separate parts.
Remember that, guys?

972
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,700
When your shoulder
was separate from this,

973
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,827
when your ass was separate
from whatever that is,

974
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,454
when your stomach was separate
from your chest.

975
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:19,668
Now it's like I'm living in a fat-muscle
onesie I can't find the zipper to.

976
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,921
"Do you like my arm-leg-backceps?"

977
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:26,591
I got gray hair. Is that scary?

978
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,512
Yeah, ladies, that means
my head is dying.

979
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:32,597
And the first thousand gray hairs,

980
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,100
they don't grow in cool
like part of the hair party,

981
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:38,645
they grow in all fuckin' crazy and swirly,
like they're on dope.

982
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,356
Like they're crack hairs,

983
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:44,568
like, "Damn, dog,
I'll suck your dick for some shampoo.

984
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,571
Just comb me, homie."

985
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:53,618
My nuts look different.
I used to have beautiful nuts.

986
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:56,412
If I had my old nuts,
I'd bring them right to you,

987
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,334
you could pass 'em to your friend and get
a look, get a snap with your phone.

988
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,711
They was gorgeous.
Beautiful little nuts.

989
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,381
Looked like the Lord
had one Christmas ornament,

990
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,258
just hung it on my "D" branch,

991
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,176
and went back to the Lord castle.

992
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,137
And they were concise nuts.

993
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:14,472
One had a good idea
and was telling the other.

994
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,433
The other one loved
his buddy's idea,

995
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,144
and they was hugging
and listening to Cat Stevens.

996
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:23,732
And they were naturally-tanned nuts.

997
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,443
And I never took my nuts in the sun
'cause I'm with Christ,

998
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,945
I don't do that kind of shit.

999
00:57:28,028 --> 00:57:30,364
Naturally tanned,
like angels came at night

1000
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:32,824
and just painted my nuts
with tanned paint,

1001
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:35,327
like the Sistine Nutsack.

1002
00:57:37,413 --> 00:57:42,334
Now, my nuts look like somebody else
been using 'em when I'm not around.

1003
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,044
Like I got timeshare nuts.

1004
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,213
Like, "Who didn't take care of these?

1005
00:57:46,297 --> 00:57:48,966
I bet it was the Thompsons,
check the log!"

1006
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,720
We're falling apart too, ladies.

1007
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:57,975
I gotta pinch my penis when I fart
so it doesn't drip a little.

1008
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:01,937
And that ain't a disease I have,
that's every man in here

1009
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,981
over the age of thirty.

1010
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,358
When you see your husband
in the hallway like this,

1011
00:58:06,442 --> 00:58:09,903
you're like, "Are you having a stroke?"
He's like, "I'm trying to fart!"

1012
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,492
We're falling apart too, man.

1013
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,662
I shit myself last year.
I'll tell you about it, bro.

1014
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,664
I ain't above nothing.

1015
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,459
I shit myself last year.
I was driving my car,

1016
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,837
and I wasn't driving to a fancy,
shit-yourself meet-up group.

1017
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,382
I was just driving,
and I reached to put the window down,

1018
00:58:30,466 --> 00:58:34,386
and I don't know what button I hit,
but I shit myself.

1019
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:38,140
'Cause you can't trust
a fart after 29, that's why.

1020
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:42,311
I used to be young and fart with both
my eyes open like a ass gangster.

1021
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,563
[blowing air]

1022
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,484
Now, I gotta keep one eye closed.

1023
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:50,568
Keeping watch on the inside.

1024
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:56,908
'Cause you will shit
your sweet Christian self.

1025
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:03,915
I look more forward to the fart after sex
than I do to sex itself.

1026
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:06,960
I was dating this gal for a while,
and she had a little cat,

1027
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:10,172
would be always in the kitchen
waiting for free meats and shit.

1028
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,673
Little Democat.

1029
00:59:12,341 --> 00:59:15,469
And I'd be back in the room,
just going at it,

1030
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:18,680
like two trains trying to pass
each other on the same track,

1031
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:20,765
but the whole time I'm thinking,
"When I get done,

1032
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:23,643
I'm-a go in the kitchen
and fart on that cat.

1033
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:26,938
That's the pussy that's really gonna
get it here tonight.

1034
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,275
That little asshole."

1035
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:34,321
We're falling apart too, ladies.
Put down the dumbbells.

1036
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,614
Pick up some flowers, look lost.

1037
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,327
It'll all work out.

1038
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:44,456
'Cause I think I want to have a child.

1039
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,750
You got any child?
What you got?

1040
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:49,253
[man] A little girl, and one in the oven.

1041
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:52,297
You got one in the oven, huh?
Hell, yeah, boy, get in there.

1042
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,344
I'm thinking of having a child.

1043
00:59:57,428 --> 01:00:01,432
I gotta get a girlfriend first, but...
I think I want a child.

1044
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:04,226
I just want something
to be at home when I'm not there.

1045
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:12,025
But a lot of these kids are
bitches these days, man, you know?

1046
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,445
Name seven kids that aren't bitches, bro.

1047
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,364
Yeah, nobody can.

1048
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:19,908
If they had a tall box right here
with a kid in it,

1049
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:23,579
I'd be like, "What's in here?
A little bitch, that's what."

1050
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:27,332
'Cause they got it too easy man.
These kids have no struggle.

1051
01:00:27,416 --> 01:00:31,420
We had struggle,
these kids have vaccinations. Come on.

1052
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,922
When I was young,
you caught what you caught.

1053
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:35,424
Everybody had something.

1054
01:00:35,507 --> 01:00:39,052
Rubella, lockjaw, we all
had a little bit of polio, remember?

1055
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:43,599
I had a friend who had a fuckin' arm
growing out of his back, Larry Armback.

1056
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:46,726
Got a great job as a crossing guard.

1057
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:50,355
He could have been an Olympic swimmer,
but he had a skin condition.

1058
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,150
He was black. So...

1059
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,569
Oh, whatever, dude.

1060
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:59,323
You can put 20 arms on a brother,
he ain't gonna wanna get in the deep end.

1061
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,371
Kids are calling the cops
on their parents, man.

1062
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:09,874
What? Back in the day
if you called the cops on your parents,

1063
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:12,169
the cops would
get your parents on the phone

1064
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:15,422
and tell your parents to beat yo' ass.

1065
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:24,889
My mother used to whoop my ass.
I didn't think she lived with us.

1066
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:30,562
She whooped me so bad one time,
I couldn't put clothes on my skin.

1067
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:34,441
My buddy's like, "You're naked!"
I'm like, "But I'm behavin'!

1068
01:01:35,484 --> 01:01:38,278
This is my behavior outfit.

1069
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:39,988
Now quit lookin' at my dick."

1070
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,870
What if I have a dumb kid?
I worry about that.

1071
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:49,080
I fucked some dumb girls, man.

1072
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:52,626
One of them hatches something,
now I got to raise that.

1073
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:56,421
I can't imagine my whole life just hugging
some kid, pretending he ain't dumb,

1074
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,048
and knowing he's dumb.

1075
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,967
Like, "Aw, everything's gonna be fine,
man."

1076
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:06,348
That's got to be the worst, man.

1077
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,933
We shouldn't let dumb people
have kids, man.

1078
01:02:09,017 --> 01:02:10,768
We wouldn't have that problem.

1079
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:14,189
If you don't graduate high school,
you shouldn't get to have a kid.

1080
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:17,942
How you gonna raise a kid?
You couldn't raise a "F" to a "D."

1081
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:24,157
The problem is we circumcise
the wrong part of the boy.

1082
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:27,952
We keep slipping off the turtleneck,
we need to take the nuts.

1083
01:02:28,036 --> 01:02:30,664
Give 'em back to him
when he graduates high school.

1084
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,875
"Congratulations, ladies and gentlemen,
it's a wonderful day.

1085
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:36,461
Ladies, move your tassels
from left to the right.

1086
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:38,213
Men, you can pick your tassels up

1087
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,299
from that cardboard box
on the way out of the auditorium."

1088
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:47,264
Some of you ladies need to quit having
eight kids

1089
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,182
before we know
what your first kid is like.

1090
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:52,227
You see a woman got seven kids
all under the age of five.

1091
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,563
Like, "How did you even fuckin' do that?

1092
01:02:54,646 --> 01:02:56,773
You ain't a woman, you a wizard."

1093
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,817
From now on, you get one kid.

1094
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,528
We check on his ass at six.

1095
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:04,114
If he ain't shit, you don't get
any more fuckin' kids.

1096
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,783
Why? 'Cause the first one ain't shit.

1097
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:12,080
Sick of this bullshit
in this country, man.

1098
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,666
Sick of it, bro.
We gotta get rid of some people.

1099
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,544
I don't know if I want
to bring a child into this world.

1100
01:03:17,628 --> 01:03:19,713
There's some straight creeps
out there, dawg.

1101
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,839
Some straight lurkers.

1102
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:25,843
If you're over the age of 30
and you still skateboard,

1103
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,513
who the fuck are you, dude?

1104
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,766
Not Tony Hawk, that's who.

1105
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,810
Jacking up my insurance premiums, sir.

1106
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,563
Now get the fuck out.

1107
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:40,358
If you wear camouflage but you ain't
in the woods or in the military,

1108
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,859
who you hiding from?

1109
01:03:43,069 --> 01:03:44,988
From looking decent, that's who.

1110
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:48,241
Operation Desert Dumb Ass.
Now put on an acceptable pattern,

1111
01:03:48,325 --> 01:03:49,909
or get the fuck out.

1112
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:54,414
If you wear sunglasses
while you work out at the gym,

1113
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:57,125
are you serious?

1114
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,796
You look like a blind person
that's good at shit.

1115
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:04,048
Only two men ever looked good
in sweat and sunglasses,

1116
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:07,427
that's Fidel Castro
and the late Macho Man Randy Savage.

1117
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:11,723
So why don't you snap into a slim piece
of advice and get the fuck out?

1118
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,643
If you sleep with the TV on,

1119
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:18,021
and wonder why you have
attention deficit disorder.

1120
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,441
I don't know, probably because
you sleep with the TV on!

1121
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:24,319
Shut it off and get some shut-eye
or get out.

1122
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:32,369
Asian people who are driving,
no more driving.

1123
01:04:32,452 --> 01:04:36,289
I know it's cliché,
but the trial period has to be over, man.

1124
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,375
They can't drive, dude.

1125
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,503
No more driving, okay?

1126
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:45,423
I don't Cirque du Soleil
'cause I can't Cirque du Soleil.

1127
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:48,259
We shouldn't just be doing shit
just because.

1128
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:52,930
So park it, Asians, and invent
the hoverboard I know you know how to make

1129
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:55,099
'cause I can see it in your eyes...

1130
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,185
or get the fuck out!

1131
01:04:57,728 --> 01:05:01,356
Thick people that's hoggin'
all the wheelchairs at the airport.

1132
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,861
And I ain't sayin' it's sistas,
but I ain't sayin' it ain't.

1133
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:10,073
Disabled Staff Sergent So-and-So,
who lost his legs in Afghanistan,

1134
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,409
gotta elbow-crawl to make his connection

1135
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:14,911
'cause Mama Bear
is hogging all the assistance.

1136
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,498
Park it and walk if off, Loqshwanda,
or get out. Okay?

1137
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,042
Persian people.

1138
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,461
Get out, bro.

1139
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:29,133
Nobody likes you guys, man.
Sorry to be the messenger.

1140
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:32,262
If you guys were offended
by anything I said tonight,

1141
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:33,971
get the fuck out, son!

1142
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:37,225
I'm Theo Von, thank you guys very much
for comin' out tonight.

1143
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,852
[applause]

1144
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:40,729
Thank you.

1145
01:05:43,064 --> 01:05:44,482
Thank you very much.

1146
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:45,901
[rap music]

1147
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:51,989
[Theo] Thank you!
