1
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:34,660
Wow!

2
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,412
Good evening, London.
You well?

3
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,247
-Yes!, Fabulous.

4
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,082
You are in very safe hands this evening.

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:43,461
I've been doing comedy now for, uh...
money and sex.

6
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,338
It's going very well.

7
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:47,673
I live in North London now,

8
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:49,884
and a guy came up to me
in the high street near where I live.

9
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:50,968
He was all excited.
He went...

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,303
"I didn't recognise you!"

11
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,597
I said, "Yeah, you did."

12
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,394
I should really have explained
when I walked on, as well,

13
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:05,524
I look like this because my dad is Irish
and my mum is Roger Federer.

14
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,573
Speaking of looks,

15
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,993
we were watching
proper BBC News the other day

16
00:01:16,077 --> 00:01:19,038
and Liz Hurley came on the news.
Not like that, obviously.

17
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,122
Ah...

18
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,502
But she was on the news.

19
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,129
She was promoting some new
TV show, and they did this thing.

20
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:29,381
They would only get away
with doing this on the news.

21
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,509
They put her age after her name.

22
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,886
So, it said,
"Liz Hurley, 50."

23
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,389
And my girlfriend turned to me and went,
"I hope I look that good when I'm 50."

24
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,725
I said, "You don't look that good now.

25
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,021
What do you think's gonna happen?

26
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,650
You're gonna get to 49 and invent
a time machine, are you? Best of luck."

27
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:50,528
Liz Hurley's a good-looking woman.

28
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,196
-You'd agree with that, wouldn't you?

29
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,073
Yeah, I mean,
I don't wanna be crude...

30
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,659
Well, I do wanna be crude,
but not till later on.

31
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:57,952
I'll ease it in.

32
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,913
It's a gift. Um...

33
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,249
Liz Hurley's a good-looking woman.

34
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,168
Put it this way,
I would ride her like a stolen bike.

35
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,676
You look as if you may require
further clarification there, sir.

36
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,221
What I'm saying is,
I would crawl over broken glass

37
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,598
to suck the cock
of the last man that fucked her.

38
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,436
We're all clear, we're all clear.
We're all caught up.

39
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,860
Ladies spend ages
getting ready for a night out.

40
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:31,944
Not all of them, obviously.

41
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,616
No, you were probably in a hurry.
Don't feel bad.

42
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,535
I was just randomly pointing down
to whoever's sat there.

43
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,872
So, that's... That is nothing
more than a happy coincidence.

44
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,666
Well, you're laughing,
but the eyes are fucking daggers.

45
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,668
I'm in all kinds of trouble.

46
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,921
My girlfriend spends ages
getting ready for a night out.

47
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:52,381
I'm not sure
what she's getting ready for.

48
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,425
Disappointment is my best guess.

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,262
Nando's and a movie.
That's our classic date night.

50
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,848
And I love the cinema.
Don't get me wrong. Love the cinema.

51
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,850
My only issue with the cinema,
it's only a little thing,

52
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:03,976
but I get annoyed by the popcorn.

53
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:08,105
I think the popcorn in a cinema should
have a very clear warning label on it,

54
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,815
saying, "May contain nuts."

55
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:13,068
Because if you're with me,
it might.

56
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,990
"I know you said you wanted salty. Wait."

57
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,994
Because I've cut a hole
in the bottom of the container.

58
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,413
And I've sort of placed it there.

59
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,957
And I've shoved my genitals
through the hole.

60
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,209
And then when the lady I'm with
has reached in to get popcorn,

61
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,754
innocently enough,
she's touched my genitals,

62
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,256
and that's caused me to ejaculate.

63
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,677
And it's that ejaculate that's caused
the salty flavour you're so familiar with.

64
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,890
I'm happy to explain any
and all of these as we go through.

65
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,894
It's clearly a mixed-ability group.

66
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,606
Horror films.
Anyone else like horror films?

67
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:51,732
Yes!

68
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,817
I like watching horror films
hiding behind the sofa,

69
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,362
'cause that way,
my neighbours don't know I'm there.

70
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:01,575
I like those black-and-white films
where no one says anything.

71
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,077
Interracial porn.

72
00:04:04,954 --> 00:04:07,206
Don't panic.
I've checked, and that one's fine.

73
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,669
Flooding.
We had pretty bad flooding last year.

74
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:16,048
I saw a woman on the news,
in her flooded front room, crying.

75
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:19,093
I thought...
"Crying's not helping.

76
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,180
If anything,
you're making matters worse, luv."

77
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,016
See, the flooding was pretty serious.

78
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,018
We knew the flooding was serious
'cause it happened in London.

79
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,103
That's when you know it's serious.

80
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:32,022
It's not as bad when it happens
in the West Country, is it?

81
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,858
Chance for them to get some use
out of those webbed fingers.

82
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:42,825
Oh, sorry, we're taping this this evening
for Netflix, so I should explain.

83
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,786
The West Country, sort of Louisiana.
There you go.

84
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,788
I'll translate as we go along.

85
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,331
Is there anyone in
from the West Country?

86
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,416
Yes!

87
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:53,127
Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin
your romantic night out with your sister.

88
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,381
I was just making a joke.
Having a bit of fun. Having fun.

89
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,845
Last time we had a white Christmas,
I made snow angels.

90
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,472
I skidded on some ice
and took out three pedestrians.

91
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,476
I recently wrote a book
about poltergeists.

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,021
And I'm pleased to say
it is flying off the shelves.

93
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,357
Proper fucking jokes in this show.

94
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,862
My friend said to me,
"What rhymes with orange?"

95
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,572
I said, "No, it doesn't."

96
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:28,579
How do they get
all those drugs into our jails?

97
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:31,206
I guess they're smuggled in
by some asshole.

98
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,751
I've only given you a joke.

99
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:34,918
You've just given me a look as if to say,

100
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,379
"Yeah, so we do that.
What's your fucking problem?"

101
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,131
What do you do for a living, sir?

102
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,010
Have a little think.
I mean...

103
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,929
I'm not busy.
Relax.

104
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,640
You're an accountant?

105
00:05:48,724 --> 00:05:50,142
Where were you
when I fucking needed you, mate?

106
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:53,228
-Eh?

107
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,648
No good showing up now.
No good showing up now.

108
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,945
If you're watching this on Netflix
in America, don't Google that.

109
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,823
-I'm a good guy.

110
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,702
Shh!

111
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,748
What a lot of comedians do on stage,
is they bullshit the audience.

112
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,042
They'll tell an audience
they've recently broken up with a girl.

113
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,168
It's bullshit.

114
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,128
The reason they do it
is to elicit sympathy

115
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,173
from attractive female audience
members, so then after the show,

116
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,634
they've got that sympathy in
when they're chatting to them at the bar.

117
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,511
They can try and sort of chat 'em up,
try and pick 'em up,

118
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:27,638
ultimately, try and shag them.

119
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,348
Rest assured,
I would never do that

120
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:33,018
because I think it would be disrespectful
to the memory of my wife.

121
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:40,776
I just need to be held.

122
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,572
Have we got any Christians in?
Is anyone here a Christian?

123
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,698
Whoo!

124
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,367
Christian there?
What's your name, sir?

125
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,618
Andreas.

126
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:51,411
Andreas?
Well, very nice to have you in.

127
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,955
An offer just for you, Andreas.

128
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,834
Would you be interested, Andreas,
in buying some magic beans?

129
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,965
I'm only asking you, Andreas,
'cause you are fucking gullible.

130
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,763
I'm sure Andreas won't mind me
sharing that with the group.

131
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:10,931
You know you are.

132
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,892
You believe the story
of a 14-year-old girl

133
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,644
who finds herself pregnant.

134
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,355
And when asked about the pregnancy,
as well she might be,

135
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,190
she goes,
"This? Not what you think.

136
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,734
I was raped by a ghost."

137
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:26,196
Really, Andreas?

138
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,990
Fast-forward 2,000 years.

139
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,659
Jeremy Kyle,

140
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,785
would you believe her then?

141
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,456
Would you?
Fuck!

142
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,458
I mean, you'd watch it,
but you'd watch it thinking,

143
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,043
"Joseph, mug. Mary, slag."

144
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:44,173
Daily Mail

145
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,885
"Immigrant Teen Mum Benefits Cheat
Living in Luxury Shed."

146
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,806
"Have you declared that gold,
frankincense and myrrh?"

147
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,434
Andreas, you don't look annoyed.
You all right?

148
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,060
-Yeah.
-You're fine. Of course you are.

149
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,021
I got a guy annoyed
with that the other week.

150
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,481
I did that bit of material,

151
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,441
and there was a guy down the front,
a middle-class guy,

152
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,567
I got him really annoyed.

153
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,068
You can tell when you've
annoyed someone middle class

154
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,153
'cause they get a bit bobbly-headed.

155
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,575
He had a point to make,
and it was rattling around in his head.

156
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,828
I said, "What's your point?"

157
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,831
He said, "I notice you make those jokes
about Jesus and the Christians,

158
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,627
but would you say that about Muhammad
or the Islamic faith, I wonder?"

159
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,880
I said, "It's a very good point.
Well made.

160
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,798
Have you thought about
blowing something up?

161
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,427
No one's scared of you."

162
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,389
Seriously, what are you gonna do, Andreas?
Forgive me?

163
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,605
I try not to censor myself on stage.
I should say that early on.

164
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,981
You know,
if I think something's funny,

165
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,566
I think you might think
it was funny as well,

166
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,360
and then we'd all have a laugh,
release some endorphins,

167
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,320
and the world would be
a very slightly better place, yeah?

168
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,614
And if anyone's offended,
eh, fuck 'em!

169
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,868
But I wrote a joke recently
that I worry about telling.

170
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,079
I wrote a joke about
the negative stereotypes

171
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:59,957
that still prevail in our society
concerning women.

172
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,083
And I worry about telling that joke,

173
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,460
because I worry,
"Well, if I were to tell that joke

174
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:06,213
and it were to be misconstrued
as genuine misogyny,

175
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,675
it could really light the fuse
on some bitch's tampon.

176
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,847
I would feel awful.
I'm not sexist.

177
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:19,810
I've got nothing but respect
for every woman I've ever slung one up.

178
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,399
Pride and Prejudice.

179
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,486
Spoiler alert, in the end,
Mr Darcy slings one up her.

180
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,196
It's very good.

181
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,990
Oh, here's an interesting fact.

182
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:37,160
The most common superstition in Britain
today is a belief in horoscopes.

183
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:40,247
And there's a name for people
that believe in horoscopes.

184
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,457
They're called single women.

185
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,212
Are there any single ladies in?
Shout, single ladies!

186
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,589
Whoo!

187
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,882
Who's the single lady down there,
give us your... What's your name?

188
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,509
-Laura.
-Laura?

189
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:53,635
What's your date of birth?
What month?

190
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,305
-February.
-What star sign is that?

191
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,098
Pisces.

192
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,225
So February,
and what's the exact date?

193
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,602
Twenty-sixth.

194
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:05,606
The 26th?

195
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,859
It's just, you die alone.

196
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,781
Normally, this is a really
upbeat bit of the show.

197
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,576
Nine times out of ten,
Mr Right is just around the corner, but...

198
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,708
Well, not alone-alone.
A cat eats your face.

199
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,460
But it's not great news, is it?
It's not...

200
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,882
I really hope this hasn't ruined
your last night out.

201
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:34,593
So, we should find out more.
What do you do?

202
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,011
I'm a student.

203
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,346
You're a student.
And what are you studying?

204
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:38,889
-Engineering.
-Engineering?

205
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,474
-Where are you from?
-China.

206
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,600
From China?

207
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,935
I'm fucking big in China.
Well done, me.

208
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,566
Are you living here, or you're just...
You're visiting?

209
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,943
And you decided,
"I'll tell you who I want to see.

210
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,111
That fella."

211
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,240
You've made a terrible decision.
This is filth.

212
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,914
You definitely didn't Google me in China.
I'll tell you that for nothing.

213
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,583
There's no way
I made it past that firewall.

214
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,543
-Um...

215
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,343
Tremendous!

216
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,515
Some people think it's good luck
if a bird shits on them.

217
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,309
And they're called German porn stars.

218
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,106
If you don't get it, Google it.

219
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,443
I find most young women
make a lot of noise in the bedroom.

220
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,238
I guess they're not expecting
to see anyone at their window.

221
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:42,786
Now, my job is writing jokes.

222
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:43,995
All I've got to do for a living
is write jokes.

223
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,748
Pretty easy job to have. Now, sometimes,
I don't even have to do that.

224
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,126
Sometimes, you just overhear people
saying something, and you think,

225
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,378
"Well, I can just tell people
what I overheard, and that's enough.

226
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,296
Just report speech.
That'll do."

227
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,924
I had this happen recently.
I was in a supermarket car park.

228
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,801
You couldn't find
a more boring place to be.

229
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,261
Just walking back to my car with a coffee.

230
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,179
I overheard these two men
having a conversation.

231
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:03,598
It was clearly gonna be a fight,
but it wasn't a fight yet.

232
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,892
So as I walked by,
I just heard a snippet of conversation.

233
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:06,977
That is all I needed.

234
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,478
I'll tell you what one man
said to another man,

235
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,064
we'll all have a laugh,
and we'll move on with our lives.

236
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:12,232
I heard one man say to another,

237
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:15,610
"You can't park in a disabled bay,
you spastic!"

238
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,075
Shut the front door!

239
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,828
"You can't park in a disabled bay,
you spastic"?

240
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:28,081
How could you be that right
and that wrong that quickly?

241
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,668
It's remarkable!

242
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,629
Of course, political correctness
has changed the world.

243
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,174
I don't mind tackling the tough topics.

244
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,551
Here's my view on immigration.

245
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,345
I sort of think these Bulgarians
and these Romanians,

246
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,599
they come over here,
taking our Polish people's jobs.

247
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,149
People that adhere
to political correctness are,

248
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,776
in my opinion, retarded faggots.

249
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,907
I can see some of you
sitting in judgement, thinking,

250
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,117
"'Retarded faggots.'
That is an offensive phrase."

251
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,702
But it's not that offensive a phrase.

252
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,704
Not when you compare it
to my impersonation of...

253
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,247
a retarded faggot.

254
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,752
"I want a cock in me.
I'm a really good bummer."

255
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,464
That's offensive.

256
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,260
Compared to that,
phrase doesn't seem as bad now, does it?

257
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,556
I've been described, London,
as a sex symbol.

258
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,517
And that symbol is a question mark.

259
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,229
Followed by a "no".

260
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,982
I've had sex
with a lot of different woman.

261
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,904
The first time I had sex,
I wanted it to be special.

262
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,989
Well, not special-special,
but consensual.

263
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,370
I actually didn't lose my virginity
until I was in my 20s,

264
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,288
and, really, the reason was being fussy.

265
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,457
Most women are really... fussy.

266
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,546
And what made it worse was my best friend
lost his virginity in year 11,

267
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,340
which would have been pretty cool,
but he was home-schooled.

268
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:05,345
It's not as bad as you think.

269
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:06,596
Fit mum.

270
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,267
It could've been worse.
It could've been ugly dad.

271
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,560
Cheer up, everyone.

272
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,898
Well, look, I've got the easiest job here.
I just tell jokes.

273
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:18,525
It doesn't get any easier
than telling jokes.

274
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:19,985
Let's find out what other people do.

275
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:21,945
Do we have any nurses in?
Is anyone a nurse?

276
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,655
-A few nurses?

277
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:26,575
You've got your hand up there.
What kind of a nurse are you?

278
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,994
-You talk to them over the phone?

279
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,871
-Yeah.
-Are you sure...

280
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,669
If you're... If people think
you're dressed as a nurse,

281
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:40,213
and you're chatting to them
on the phone, I think... I'm not sure...

282
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,011
"You're feeling very stiff,
are you? I see.

283
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,097
I think I can help."

284
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,683
Any other nurses?
What else we got?

285
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:55,896
Geriatric? Can't go wrong
with geriatric, can you?

286
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,732
If you give 'em too much of something,
and then, "Oh, he's dead."

287
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,068
No one's doing an autopsy
on a 91-year-old.

288
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,236
Fuck it, you're fine.

289
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,490
Any others?

290
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,575
Intensive care!

291
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,785
Intensive care?
That's interesting.

292
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,496
So the other nurses...
Do you care about your patients?

293
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,375
You care? Do you care about your patients?
Do you?

294
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,046
Little bit.
Not like she fucking cares.

295
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,547
Intensively.

296
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,511
"Hope they make it."

297
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,055
Any others?
What else we got?

298
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,681
Paediatric!
Student!

299
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,849
Sorry, student?

300
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,392
We should get together
and have a chat after the show

301
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,436
'cause I'm also not a nurse.

302
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:40,941
-What, sorry?

303
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,776
Sorry, did you just say dental?

304
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,152
A dental nurse?

305
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,488
Well, I think we can all agree,
that doesn't count.

306
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,116
-Definitely doesn't count. No way.

307
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,368
Are you joking?

308
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:58,583
Let me ask you, sir.
I don't know what you do for a living.

309
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,002
If I gave you
a disgusting pink fluid to drink,

310
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:04,214
and there was a sink there,
and I said, "Rinse",

311
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,132
-would you be able to...

312
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,051
...work out where to spit it?

313
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:09,719
You would?

314
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,347
We don't need you!
We don't need you.

315
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,396
A nurse finds a rectal thermometer
in her pocket and thinks,

316
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,981
"Some asshole's got my pen."

317
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,111
Social networking sites.

318
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,570
Are you all
on the social networking sites?

319
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:28,738
Yeah!

320
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,991
They're bloody good, aren't they?
They help people to meet people.

321
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,158
That's what they do brilliantly.

322
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,785
I've got a friend of mine,
gay friend of mine,

323
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,203
joined Grindr a couple of weeks ago,

324
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,997
and his social life
has been such a whirlwind,

325
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,790
he's hardly been able to sit down.

326
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:44,295
That's a joke about
super-aggressive anal sex.

327
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,383
You got that?
Well, that is to your credit.

328
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,761
Lesbians get a lot out of Internet dating.

329
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,471
I'll explain.

330
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,141
We've all got pretty good gaydar
these days, haven't we?

331
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,393
We're all familiar with gaydar,
the term, yes?

332
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,477
Yeah, yes.

333
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:02,105
So gaydar is the voice in your head that,
when you meet a gay guy, goes,

334
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,231
"Oh, a gay guy."

335
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,359
If you say out loud,

336
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,611
"Bummer on the loose!
Bummer on the loose!"

337
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:12,782
That is homophobia.
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

338
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:16,703
Yeah, I just said that.
Deal with it.

339
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,416
But with lesbians, the gaydar certainly
needs to be more finely tuned, doesn't it?

340
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,334
For the lesbians,
it needs to be more finely tuned.

341
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,546
But, yeah, sometimes, it's very difficult
to know whether a woman is a lesbian

342
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,424
or just a regular girl
in a very bad mood.

343
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,346
And if you're a lesbian,
and you didn't find that funny,

344
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,182
well, you've proved my point for me.

345
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,063
Are there any lesbians in?
Does anyone favour the flatter shoe?

346
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,150
Any lady golfers?

347
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,904
Is anyone here "allergic to nuts"?

348
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:56,034
Would any of the women in here
describe themselves as crack addicts?

349
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:02,499
Or vagitarian?

350
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,546
Seriously, are there any lesbians in?

351
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,430
Well, you're definitely
one of the butcher ones, aren't ya?

352
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,854
Maybe there are none in.
That would be a very weird thing.

353
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,523
Maybe no one's full-time.

354
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,236
Gay dudes pretty much
go full-time, don't they?

355
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,156
You meet very few bisexual men.
I've met, like, a handful in my life.

356
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,535
Of bisexual men.
They're like fucking unicorns.

357
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:41,788
Men make a decision about dicks early on.

358
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,375
Either, "This one's good.
The rest can fuck off."

359
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:49,462
Or, "These are all delicious!"

360
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,510
It's one or the other forever.

361
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,763
Whereas, with the lesbians,
it could be a mood thing, can't it?

362
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,223
It could be a mood thing.

363
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,434
"Spaghetti" is, I believe, the term.

364
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,229
Straight until wet.

365
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:13,153
If you're not laughing, you're learning.
And that's great, too. Great to learn.

366
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,823
We had a lovely
lesbian couple in recently.

367
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,199
They were sitting
sort of front and centre.

368
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,617
And I got chatting to them.

369
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,536
And, you know,
as well I might, I said,

370
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,164
"Girls, what would it take
to get you back on solids?"

371
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,544
And one of the girls, quick as a flash,
went, "12 inches."

372
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,422
I said,
"Well, I could give you 12 inches...

373
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,882
in three instalments."

374
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,468
Of course, the big question,
at the moment, globally, is

375
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,012
"Should gay men
be allowed to get married?"

376
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,098
And I'm a liberal. I say yes,
as long as they find the right woman.

377
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,769
I could have been gay.
I failed the oral.

378
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,356
Don't neglect the balls.
There's a lesson.

379
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,236
There is one sexual grouping
that annoys me in society, one grouping.

380
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,946
And it's actually heterosexual men.

381
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,865
It's only been the last couple of years.

382
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,701
8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown.

383
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,330
As a result of doing that show,
I'm now associated with Rachel Riley.

384
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,207
-And as a result of that...

385
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,666
Well, this is the problem.

386
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,337
I'll be on trains, in bars, hotels,
wherever I happen to be.

387
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,505
Men will come up to me.
They won't even say hello to me.

388
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,759
They'll just come up to me and go,
"Rachel Riley. I'd give her one!"

389
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,471
"Well, she'll be thrilled.
How can we get in touch?"

390
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,807
I mean, I get it.
Rachel Riley is a very attractive woman.

391
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,018
If she was my daughter,
I'd still be bathing her.

392
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,400
True story. Um...

393
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,612
But let's be realistic.

394
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,490
I'm 43 years of age.
Rachel Riley is 28.

395
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,576
I look at her and think,
"Aw, if only you were ten years younger."

396
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,248
The thing that's annoying
about straight men, as well,

397
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,583
it's all about surface.
Just about looks and nothing else.

398
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,753
It's never about her mind.
And her mind is the extraordinary thing.

399
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,131
She's so clever. She's like a walking,
talking Stephen Hawking.

400
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,097
She's brainier than
Kurt Cobain's garage ceiling.

401
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:09,060
Too soon?

402
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,188
Fuck him.
He was always shooting his mouth off.

403
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,483
I think everyone's here.

404
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,777
Is there an empty seat there
in the middle?

405
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,238
You haven't been stood up for a date,
have you, madam?

406
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,823
-No.
-No?

407
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,033
-It's her carer.
-It's her carer?

408
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:30,039
Someone's not getting laid tonight,
but totally worth it, sir. Well played.

409
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,792
-100% worth it.

410
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,502
Good on you.

411
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,881
I had great latecomers the other week.
So, I think everyone's here,

412
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,216
but I had great latecomers the other week.

413
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,468
So I was playing this venue,
and it had a wooden floor.

414
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:45,263
And this couple walked in about,
you know, half an hour into the show.

415
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,100
They walked in, and the lady
had really clumpy shoes on.

416
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:50,226
So as she walked in,

417
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,729
it was, like, the loudest thing
you've ever heard, as she walked in.

418
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,273
And it really pulled focus,
and they sat sort of front and centre.

419
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,566
And so, I thought,
"Well, I'd better say hello."

420
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,318
I said, "Well, how come
you guys are late?"

421
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,486
And the guy said,
really aggressively, he said,

422
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,821
"She's pregnant."

423
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,909
Immediately, I'm on the back foot.
I went, "Right. When's it due?"

424
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,953
And he went,
"About nine months."

425
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,500
Fucking legend!

426
00:22:16,586 --> 00:22:19,213
Now some of you sent me
text messages during the evening,

427
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:20,590
and thank you very much.

428
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,634
And some of you sent me text messages,
and fuck you very much.

429
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,221
I'll show you what I mean.
First one in.

430
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,683
"Jimmy, are you disappointed that
instead of being hung like a donkey,

431
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,477
you laugh like one?"

432
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,445
I really wish I didn't laugh at that.

433
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:43,821
Especially like that.

434
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,825
"What's the difference between
three cocks and a joke?

435
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,410
Your mum can't take a joke."

436
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:57,502
"Can you stop dissing my dad?
Thanks, Jesus."

437
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,463
Is that Andreas?

438
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,051
Have you got an emoji
of a church on your phone?

439
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:06,177
Tragic.

440
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:12,100
"Went to my daughter's
netball finals the other day!

441
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,351
What a semi!"

442
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,489
"Hey, Jimmy.
It's mine and my boyfriend's one year.

443
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,615
Threesome?"

444
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,868
Well, whose one-year anniversary is it?
Where are you?

445
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,621
Hello, how are you?

446
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,623
Can I just have a look?

447
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,293
Nah, I'll be all right, thanks.

448
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:45,216
"What is your stance on midget porn?"

449
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,303
Like a deep lunge.

450
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,145
Sorry, sir, we made eye contact.

451
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,689
I really feel like
we're in this together now, mate.

452
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,404
That's tough on the hamstrings.

453
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,950
"Please, can you take
the piss out of my fiancée?

454
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:13,286
She's five months pregnant and ginger."

455
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,750
Where's the ginger pregnant lady?
Where are you?

456
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:20,877
I'm not gonna take the piss.

457
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,005
I'll say to you what I say to all
ginger women I meet who are pregnant.

458
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,131
Well done!

459
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,052
Well done.
You tricked someone into fucking that!

460
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:39,020
"I became a proud dad today.

461
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:40,146
My son is actually four,

462
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,023
but he was a boring little cunt
for the first three years."

463
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,406
There's a ring of truth there,
isn't there?

464
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,366
"He doesn't do much.
He can't even kick a fucking ball."

465
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,956
"Hi, Jimmy. What would you do
to make a wedding day stand out

466
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,499
and be even more special?"

467
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,752
Leave her at the aisle.

468
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,214
Who's getting married?
Who sent me that? Who's...

469
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,965
You two are getting married?

470
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:10,301
You are... I mean,
I don't want to be rude to you, sir.

471
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:11,469
You seem like a lovely fella,

472
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:13,596
but you are punching
way above your weight.

473
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,641
That's unbelievable.
How have you done that?

474
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,100
Has she got low self-esteem
or have you got money?

475
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,227
What's going on?

476
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:24,815
You can't see it, but this is...
I mean, they're like different species.

477
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:28,527
This is...
Well played, man, well played.

478
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,154
Well, madam,
I've got a tip for you.

479
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,031
Or if you like,
I could put the whole thing in.

480
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,829
She said yes, yeah?
She hasn't said much so far.

481
00:25:38,913 --> 00:25:40,289
You're 100% sure
she's gonna marry you?

482
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,832
She's wearing the ring.

483
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,167
She's wearing the ring?

484
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,336
Yeah, 'cause girls hate jewellery.
I remember now.

485
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,589
Fucking terrific.
Well played.

486
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:50,841
Go on, what else have we got?

487
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:53,010
"My son was thrown out of school today

488
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,846
for letting a girl in his class
wank him off.

489
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,683
I said,
'Son, that's three schools this year.

490
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,559
Maybe teaching isn't for you.'"

491
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:12,029
"Hey, Jimmy, what would be your advice
for finding my friend David a girlfriend?

492
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,281
Thanks."

493
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:15,283
Right, where's David?

494
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:17,285
Hey, David.
How are you, mate?

495
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,411
I'm good.

496
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,038
And you're looking for...
How long have you been single?

497
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:23,291
-Too long.
-Too long?

498
00:26:23,374 --> 00:26:26,919
Not to worry.
Do you like engineering students?

499
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:32,258
Of course you fucking do.
What do you think?

500
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,680
You don't... Sorry.
"I don't live in this country"?

501
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,810
Sir, do you remember earlier
when she was a student in this country,

502
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,145
studying engineering?

503
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:46,439
She's giving all that up...

504
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,276
not to be with you,
but to make sure it doesn't happen.

505
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,069
That is a...

506
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:53,362
What do you do?

507
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,073
-I work in a gym.
-You work in a gym?

508
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:58,826
Okay. And do you...
Do you know that you're gay yet, or not?

509
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:05,374
'Cause I know this can be a tough way
to find out, but I've got the super...

510
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,585
I've got, like, the deluxe gaydar,

511
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:10,755
and it turns out
what you like is not that.

512
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,969
You work in a gym, do ya?
Hmm...

513
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,140
Are you muscly?

514
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,934
Why am I seducing a man now?
This doesn't seem...

515
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,523
I'm gonna try and sleep with him
just to prove a point. Come on.

516
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,652
Did any other single ladies
see him and like the idea?

517
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,112
-Whoo!
-You... I, well...

518
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,364
That sounded like...

519
00:27:36,906 --> 00:27:40,034
I mean, I've also got "slagdar".
That...

520
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,830
I mean, it might not be a relationship,
but that will fuck you in half.

521
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:46,791
What else we got?

522
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:49,001
"Jimmy, I went to the gym last week,

523
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:52,671
and I noticed a hole in my trainer
big enough to put my finger in.

524
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:55,674
Anyway, she made a formal complaint,
and I'm banned for life."

525
00:28:01,972 --> 00:28:03,724
It's a shame that wasn't
a "he made a formal complaint."

526
00:28:03,808 --> 00:28:05,643
That would've been perfect.

527
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,772
"What's the difference between
a lentil and a chickpea?"

528
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,191
I don't know, what is the difference
between a lentil and a chickpea?

529
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:14,318
"I wouldn't pay £200
to have a lentil on my face."

530
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,286
The Lego Movie."

531
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,752
"Don't let them take the piss
out of your clothes, Jimmy.

532
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,629
That's the best material you've got."

533
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:38,968
So mean.

534
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:41,971
Quite enough of that.

535
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,266
Thanks for those.

536
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:49,395
My girlfriend gets annoyed
by my loud chewing,

537
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:52,064
but I don't complain about
the pubes in my teeth.

538
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:57,236
It's a joke!
My girlfriend hasn't got pubes.

539
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,780
Yet.

540
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:07,496
If you only laughed when I said "yet",
you're a bad person.

541
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,791
There's something you can get, gentlemen,

542
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:14,211
if you have, or you perceive
that you have, a small penis.

543
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:17,173
It's called an Audi convertible.

544
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,470
Have you got an Audi convertible?

545
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,223
She just gave you a look
like something in the joke related to you.

546
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:27,767
You're saying
it definitely wasn't the car.

547
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,230
Okay...

548
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,524
-What do you do for a living, sir?
-I'm an osteopath.

549
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:39,320
An osteopath. Okay. I mean,
just say masseuse if you mean masseuse.

550
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:45,451
Tired businessman away from home.
Full of questions.

551
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:48,621
Curious as to what an osteopath might do.

552
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,664
And what about you, the other half?
What do you do?

553
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,583
-I'm his sister.
-You're his sister?

554
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,548
Um, well, I don't approve.

555
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:04,261
You're not the other half.
You're his sister. Okay.

556
00:30:04,345 --> 00:30:08,057
And you guys, you're just out
on a Saturday night... on a date.

557
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,103
This is the worst Tinder has ever got it.

558
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:15,940
It's my birthday present.

559
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,566
This is your birthday present?

560
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,692
Well, I...
Well, happy birthday.

561
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:20,027
I can't ask your age 'cause you're a lady,

562
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,445
but, um, how much do you weigh?

563
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,077
Go on, what, what...
Is it a big birthday?

564
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,787
-Is it a big birthday, small birthday?
-Twenty-three.

565
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,956
Twenty-three?
You're so young.

566
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,625
Well, look,
why don't we make it special?

567
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,877
After the show, come backstage,
and I'll finger blast you.

568
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,091
It's a joke.

569
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,593
I'll fuck her.

570
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,265
All the teachers at my school
were really strict.

571
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,351
I remember every Monday morning,
I had to give the deputy head.

572
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:59,149
Now, I keep on getting asked, "Why aren't
there more female stand-up comedians?"

573
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:01,986
It should be 50-50, right?
'Cause the population is 50-50.

574
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,821
Men and women laugh
at the same things.

575
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,781
We think of the same
funny things to say in life.

576
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:06,991
So it should be 50-50,

577
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,951
the sort of proportion
of comedians on stage.

578
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,661
But it isn't.
And I was wondering why.

579
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:13,122
I think it's 'cause women have
an ability that men don't possess.

580
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,457
Women have the ability
to think of something funny to say,

581
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:16,625
and then not say it.

582
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,338
Because it might "hurt someone's
feelings" or be inappropriate.

583
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,884
Well, men don't really have that gear.

584
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:28,137
What we've got is probably best
described as Joke Tourette's.

585
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:32,808
If we think something might be funny,
we are fucking saying it.

586
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:36,061
Not later on,
when everyone's calmed down.

587
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,063
Right fucking now.

588
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,441
We could be at your mum's funeral.

589
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,986
"All right, luv,
she's not the only thing that's stiff.

590
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:50,659
Well, nothing ventured.
She was already in a terrible mood.

591
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:54,747
Lovely spread, she's got a face on.
There's no pleasing some people."

592
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,334
My Joke Tourette's occasionally
gets me into, like, proper trouble.

593
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,835
Have we got any police in?
Any police officers?

594
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,171
-Whoo!
-Oh, there's one over there?

595
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:04,548
Look, I got stopped speeding.
Not the worst thing I've done.

596
00:32:04,632 --> 00:32:05,883
Face facts.

597
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:07,885
So I got pulled over for speeding, right?

598
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:08,969
And the police officer came round

599
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,721
to the window of the car
and did the usual thing of going,

600
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:11,931
"Do you know how fast you were going?"

601
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:15,059
I said, "I'm sorry, Officer.
Clearly too fast. I'm so sorry."

602
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:17,728
Couldn't have been nicer and more
middle class about the whole thing.

603
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:20,606
And he went,
"Eighty-eight miles an hour!"

604
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:23,317
And I said, "I was trying
to get back to 1955."

605
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,155
Three fucking points on my licence.

606
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,324
Would you have let me off?

607
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,910
-No!
-No?

608
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:36,163
What, you think 88's too fast
to be doing in a 30 zone during the day?

609
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,959
In my defence,
I was fucking hammered.

610
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:45,422
I hate oversleeping,
waking up and suddenly realising,

611
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:46,966
"Ah! I'm in the wrong lane!"

612
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,053
Must be tough being an air hostess.

613
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:52,471
Their ears must pop all the time,

614
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,640
what with sucking
the pilot's cock so hard.

615
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,519
Joking. I'm sure they get used to it.

616
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:01,522
PC thinks it's helping,

617
00:33:01,605 --> 00:33:04,108
but I'm not sure political correctness
really changes anything.

618
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,317
Because of political correctness,

619
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,987
you're not meant to say
"air hostess" any more, are you?

620
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,906
You're meant to say,
if it's a woman, "sky waitress",

621
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,200
and if it's a man, "homosexual".

622
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:16,495
Doesn't really change anything.

623
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:20,541
I joke a lot about sexism and misogyny,
just because I view them as ridiculous,

624
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:22,835
sort of, risible things in our society.

625
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,504
But when you hear a story about
someone being actually sexist,

626
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,548
it blows your mind
that people could be that ignorant.

627
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:28,882
I heard a story recently.

628
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,301
I was flying to New York,
and I got chatting to the flight crew.

629
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,804
They told me what had happened
the week before. I'll tell you the story.

630
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:35,848
So, you know when the pilot does
the little Tannoy announcement

631
00:33:35,931 --> 00:33:37,891
at the beginning of a flight?
He does the little,

632
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:39,560
"Hello, I'm your captain, Jonathan,

633
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:42,104
and we're flying at 38,000 feet
to New York today."

634
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,481
And you're sitting there,
flicking through a magazine, thinking,

635
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:46,442
"Couldn't give a fuck who you are.

636
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,820
And I know where we're going.
It says it on the ticket."

637
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,991
You don't get that anywhere else, do you?
You don't get that in the back of a taxi.

638
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:56,827
"Hello, my name's Eric,
and we're going to your house."

639
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,999
"Wind your neck in, Eric.
Drive the car."

640
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,796
So, on this occasion,
it happened to be a female pilot.

641
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,089
So it was,
"Hello, my name's Sharla,

642
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:12,217
I'm your pilot today, and we're flying
at 38,000 feet to New York."

643
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:15,429
And this guy on the flight
undid his seat belt, got up,

644
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,431
got his hand luggage
down from the overhead,

645
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,475
and started walking down the aisle.

646
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:22,144
So the cabin crew are having
a little hissy fit.

647
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,813
They said, "Sir, you've got to sit down.
We're about to take off."

648
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,899
He said, "No, I'm getting off."

649
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,360
They said, "What's the problem?"

650
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,196
He said, "Woman driver."

651
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,533
What a fucking lunatic!

652
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:39,036
It's not as if
she had to reverse it into New York.

653
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:44,792
I don't know about you, London,

654
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,877
but I get terrified flying
at the best of times.

655
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,254
'Cause you never know
how reliable or durable

656
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,381
the condom in your stomach is gonna be.

657
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,718
Do you all listen to
the safety announcement when you fly?

658
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:57,471
-No!
-You've got to!

659
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,389
Otherwise, you're not gonna know
where your whistle is

660
00:34:59,473 --> 00:35:01,975
when a maniac blows you
out of the fucking sky.

661
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:10,025
"Take that, ISIS!"

662
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:24,081
For all the fucking good it does,
the crash position might as well be that.

663
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,792
"Hope we don't die."

664
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:29,878
Doesn't matter.
I mean, the bad news is,

665
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,798
when a 747 crashes or blows up,
everyone dies.

666
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,384
The good news is you don't have
to listen to the safety announcement.

667
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,677
There's really no point.

668
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,639
You're never in a bar the night after
a plane crash, with a friend, going,

669
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,015
"It's awful, isn't it?
Did you read about that?

670
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:43,517
Three-hundred people.
What a terrible thing.

671
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,310
What an awful way to go.
How shocking."

672
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:48,147
Someone at the bar never goes,
"Plane crash? Couldn't help but overhear.

673
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:49,731
Yeah, I was in one of those.

674
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,609
Nah, I was fine. Thank you.

675
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,486
Well, no, 'cause I was sat like that.

676
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,615
So the fireball went round me.

677
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,828
The guy next to me, though?
Decapitated.

678
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,123
It's his own fault, really.
He had the tray table down.

679
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:08,208
What was he hoping for?

680
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,798
No, no, at 3,000 miles from land.
Right in the middle of the Pacific, yeah.

681
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,467
No, they found me straight away,
about ten minutes.

682
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,094
How?"

683
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:32,316
Has anyone ever made
the right amount of pasta?

684
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,071
That's my little toe in the water
of observational comedy.

685
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,573
I'm not really sure if it's for me.

686
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,658
Obviously, if I was any good
at observational comedy, you know,

687
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,410
I'd probably get
five minutes of fun out of that.

688
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,789
You're on your own.

689
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:50,334
Is anyone here gluten-free?

690
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:54,213
You're gluten-free? Fun fact for you.
It is possible to be gluten-free

691
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,215
and shut the fuck up.

692
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,010
No one cares.

693
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:03,889
I don't like spending too much
time with my girlfriend's family

694
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,016
because her husband is getting suspicious.

695
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,271
My girlfriend was in the park doing
one of those "race for life" things.

696
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:13,941
When I say "race for life",
she was fleeing a rapist.

697
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,319
It's how we met.

698
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,823
I tend not to get heckled
that much any more.

699
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,158
I used to get heckled a lot.

700
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:24,534
-I kind of--

701
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,543
That was properly Tourette's-y.
Well played.

702
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,256
People with Tourette's,
what makes them tick?

703
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:41,218
But genuinely, I like it when
people join in at shows.

704
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:44,179
I got the best heckle
of my career last year,

705
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,931
at someone else's show.

706
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,642
I went to see another comedian
up in Edinburgh, my friend Nick Helm,

707
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:49,851
and I got heckled at his show.

708
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,895
That is not what should happen.
That is what happened.

709
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,897
And I was sat at the back.
It's about 200 people in the room.

710
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:55,983
I was sat at the back,
trying to stifle my laugh.

711
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:59,528
I've got a weird laugh.
I laugh on an in, not an out.

712
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,407
So instead of going "ha, ha",
like a normal human might, I go...

713
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,954
It's weird, right?

714
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,123
It's a weird,
honking goose of a laugh.

715
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,835
But if I know I'm gonna be laughing,

716
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,586
and I knew I was gonna be
laughing at my friend's show.

717
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,047
So I was sat at the back,
and I was kind of repressing my laugh.

718
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:22,217
I was... Closed mouth, and sort of
keeping it locked down. I was...

719
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,726
It sounded like someone
had smuggled in an owl.

720
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,772
But there I was for the first 20 minutes,
just sat at the back very quietly...

721
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,985
About 20 minutes into the show,
he did a song on stage,

722
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,278
and I found it hilarious.

723
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:44,865
I had a proper, full-on laughing fit.

724
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,951
Like proper...

725
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,675
It sounded fucking mental.

726
00:39:04,718 --> 00:39:08,055
It sounded like a seal getting
finger-blasted, is what it sounded like.

727
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,559
And Nick just stopped the show...

728
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:14,728
and went, "All right, Jimmy?

729
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:18,398
I don't laugh when
I come to see your shows."

730
00:39:23,445 --> 00:39:27,115
Well, with that in mind, why don't we
have a proper heckle amnesty.

731
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,494
If you would like to have a heckle,
this would be the ideal time.

732
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,661
-Not--
-Wanker!

733
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,374
You look like you fucked a pig!

734
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,667
I look like I fucked a pig?

735
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,337
Do I still owe your mum money?
Is she annoyed, is she?

736
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,298
There you go.

737
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:55,727
Sorry, ma'am,
I haven't got any coins on me.

738
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:03,652
-My partner thinks you're too crude.
-Your partner thinks I'm too crude?

739
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:07,614
So she's been brought along
to the show and it's not really for her?

740
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,241
Are you going to make it up to her
somehow later on?

741
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,325
Yeah.

742
00:40:10,409 --> 00:40:13,036
Maybe pop a thumb in her ass
while you're fucking her?

743
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,751
Madam, you can't sink down
any lower in that seat.

744
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:23,880
That is as low...
That's as low as that...

745
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:29,594
When does the comedy start?

746
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:30,971
When does the comedy start?

747
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:33,390
-It's a classic.

748
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:37,686
It's a classic heckle, right?
What's your name, sir?

749
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:38,770
Rack!

750
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:40,897
Like shoe rack?
You're called Rack?

751
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,233
Where are you, Rack,
up there or down there?

752
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,028
Loving your work, Rack.
It's one of those things.

753
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:50,449
If you don't think
the comedy's started, you're right.

754
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,451
And if you think
the comedy has started, you're right.

755
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,743
'Cause it's a very individual thing,
isn't it?

756
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:56,204
And if the show's not for you,
it's not for you.

757
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,081
I feel bad if you paid all this
money to come and see me,

758
00:40:58,165 --> 00:40:59,332
and you don't think it's funny.

759
00:40:59,416 --> 00:41:00,709
You've had a disaster.

760
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,961
But I suppose, Rack,
you have learnt a valuable lesson.

761
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,963
You've learned life's not fair.

762
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,133
You pays your money,
you takes your chance,

763
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,844
sometimes it's a good show,
sometimes it's not for you.

764
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:12,012
But I'll give you another example, Rack,

765
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,473
so you haven't had a wasted evening.
At least you've learned something.

766
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,601
Another example of how unfair,
Rack, our society is.

767
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,727
Let's say, if a man...

768
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,897
You or I, sir, let's say, if a man sleeps
with loads and loads of women.

769
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,442
What is he? He's a stud, he's a player,
he's admired in our society.

770
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,985
That isn't an opinion,
that's fact.

771
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,780
If a guy sleeps with loads of women,
he's a player, he's a stud, he's admired.

772
00:41:30,864 --> 00:41:33,492
But if a woman sleeps with
loads and loads of men,

773
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:35,535
she's called Rack's mum.

774
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,462
I'm fairly...

775
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:49,132
It's all right for me to say that 'cause
Rack's mum's not gonna be here, is she?

776
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:50,675
Saturday night?
You're having a laugh.

777
00:41:52,052 --> 00:41:53,428
It's her busiest evening.

778
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:56,890
She does a special two for one.

779
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,559
This sort of stage on a Saturday night,

780
00:41:59,643 --> 00:42:02,270
I imagine Rack's mum looks
like a plasterer's radio.

781
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,985
What was that, Rack?

782
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,905
Your face
is like a 42-inch widescreen TV!

783
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:16,618
My face is like
a 42-inch widescreen... TV?

784
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,204
In that...

785
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,000
-It's very wide!
-It's very wide?

786
00:42:29,381 --> 00:42:30,507
Okay.

787
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,593
Um, I've just...

788
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:36,805
I've just said that
your mum's a prostitute.

789
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:39,641
And...

790
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:43,645
And you just said,
"Your face is wide."

791
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:46,648
I don't...

792
00:42:48,483 --> 00:42:51,236
Rack, I don't... I'm not sure
if you know how this works.

793
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,489
I'll tell you why it's wide as well.

794
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:56,449
All that, it's... It...

795
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:04,457
Aw, bless him. Um...

796
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,126
Any other heckles?
Should we do one more?

797
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:10,630
How about a heckle not involving
mothers, girlfriends, or sex?

798
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:15,218
A heckle not involving
girlfriends, mothers, or sex.

799
00:43:15,302 --> 00:43:16,928
Well, where are you from, sir?
Let's do one.

800
00:43:17,804 --> 00:43:18,805
Canada!

801
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,140
You're from Canada?

802
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:22,183
So you're an American,
but you're not armed.

803
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,650
Ah...

804
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,110
Aw, well, Canadians are always...

805
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,945
Whenever I meet a Canadian,
they always explain to me,

806
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,155
"No, I'm not an American."

807
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,323
I get the same thing with New Zealand

808
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:37,449
and Australian people, they sort of go,

809
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,284
"No, I'm not Australian.
I'm actually from New Zealand."

810
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:42,078
I think they're mistaking me
for someone who gives a fuck.

811
00:43:43,872 --> 00:43:44,914
Are there any Australians in?

812
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,293
Well, welcome back.

813
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,382
You've paid your debt,
you've returned to the scene of the crime.

814
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:01,348
Someone over there.
Hello.

815
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:03,016
Who the fuck is that?
Hello, who?

816
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:04,976
The
Shining?

817
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:10,231
Steadicam, I love... Fucking hell.
Look how my ego's gotten out of control.

818
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:11,816
Who... Are you filming him?

819
00:44:12,484 --> 00:44:13,777
I mean, I don't want
to be a dick about it,

820
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,820
but I feel like
the action's really up here.

821
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:20,533
You're just filming a fat dude
in the second row. Okay, fine.

822
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,701
Oh!

823
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:22,786
What do you mean, "Oh"?

824
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,038
He's got a mirror in his house.
He fucking knows.

825
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,414
He's all right.

826
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,090
-So...
-Oi, you posh twat!

827
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,593
Oh!

828
00:44:39,803 --> 00:44:41,429
Well, a fun fact for you.

829
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,890
Your girlfriend's got two cunts.

830
00:44:45,475 --> 00:44:47,811
She's sat next to one of them, isn't she?

831
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,609
I'm sorry.
I called you a cunt there.

832
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,777
I'm terribly sorry.

833
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,321
I'm sure you don't have the depth
or the capacity to give pleasure.

834
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:11,334
I went to a proper showbiz party recently,
and Brad Pitt was there.

835
00:45:11,418 --> 00:45:13,503
And they say,
"Never meet your heroes",

836
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,797
but I think Brad handled it really well.

837
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,259
A lot of people think
cooking your partner a meal

838
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:21,177
is the most romantic
gesture you could make.

839
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,805
The least romantic gesture,
if you're interested, is this.

840
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,685
On my birthday...
I'm a very lucky man.

841
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:31,354
On my birthday, my girlfriend
likes to wake me up with oral sex.

842
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:33,440
Last year, I nearly suffocated.

843
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,653
No, last year, on my birthday,
my girlfriend gave me the bumps,

844
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,781
or as they're more commonly known,
genital warts.

845
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:46,453
You can tell a lot about a woman
from looking at her shoes.

846
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,414
For example, if they're
behind her ears, she likes you.

847
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,920
When a man changes his status on Facebook
from "single" to "in a relationship",

848
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:58,923
I think it should say,
"under new management".

849
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:01,468
Now, some couples...
Are there couples in?

850
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:02,927
Give a shout,
all the couples in the room.

851
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,305
-Loads of...
-Whoo!

852
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,141
Sorry, mate.
That's sort of rubbing it in, isn't it?

853
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:15,440
There are some couples who are very
free and easy with their bodily functions.

854
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,902
They don't mind their partner
being in the bathroom

855
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,321
while they're taking
nature's call of a morning.

856
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:22,447
Their partner could be
brushing their teeth

857
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,324
while they're taking care of business.

858
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,408
I think we all know what I'm saying.

859
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:27,577
And there's a name for those people.
They're called...

860
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,454
fucking animals.

861
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,415
You disgust us.

862
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:35,210
I've got some advice
for the men in the room.

863
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,087
Okay, I'm gonna keep this simple 'cause
men are inherently simple creatures.

864
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:41,758
Gentlemen, I'll just say it.
Gentlemen, never say "fanny fart".

865
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:44,219
It's a good example
of your Joke Tourette's.

866
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,471
Not everything in life
needs to be a little joke.

867
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:50,558
Actually, a lot of ladies are very
self-conscious when they do a muff puff.

868
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,314
The last thing they want is you making
a joke about their massive cunt grunt.

869
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,737
Embarrassing Bodies?

870
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,281
-Yes!
-It's a fabulous piece of television.

871
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:08,076
Embarrassing Bodies?

872
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,828
So, we play a game in our house.

873
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:12,997
Embarrassing Bodies

874
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:15,375
with their medical problems
before seeing the doctor,

875
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:18,670
we pause the TV and try and guess
what is up with that.

876
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,341
So this girl, this 18-year-old girl,
pretty little thing,

877
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:25,385
Embarrassing Bodies

878
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:27,971
We pause the TV and try
and guess what the problem might be.

879
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,806
We could've been there all week,
we wouldn't have got it.

880
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,851
She was having surgery on her nuni.

881
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:36,145
On her vajayjay, her twinkle cave.

882
00:47:37,063 --> 00:47:39,566
Her peachy pocket.
And the thing was,

883
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:42,527
there was nothing
the matter with her cunt.

884
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,364
Perfectly healthy piece of equipment.
She was having, get this,

885
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:49,909
cosmetic surgery on her vagina.

886
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,704
And me and my girlfriend paused the TV.

887
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,871
We went, "Well, the world's gone mad."

888
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:56,165
That isn't a medical problem.
That's a psychological problem.

889
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:57,875
If anything, that's a societal problem.

890
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,420
That a girl's self-esteem
could be that low at that tender age

891
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,088
that she feels she needs
to go under the knife

892
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:03,881
in order to live up to
some idealised version

893
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:05,258
of what she thinks her genitals
should look like

894
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,593
'cause she's seen something online.

895
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,219
That's crazy.
That's body dysmorphia.

896
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:10,179
And they shouldn't be facilitating
that kind of madness

897
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:12,599
on what is normally
a very socially responsible show.

898
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:14,976
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

899
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,520
So we unpaused the TV,
and as soon as we...

900
00:48:17,604 --> 00:48:18,688
It's a very visceral programme.

901
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,900
So they cut back to a close-up of her most
intimate lady garden, bathing suit area.

902
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:25,194
And both me and my girlfriend agreed.
We both said,

903
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:27,030
"Well, that needs fucking fixing!

904
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,491
It's like a badly packed kebab.

905
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:36,414
Who has garlic mayo and chilli sauce?
What the fuck?"

906
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,460
I thought I'd never seen one
I didn't like.

907
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,087
She had a fanny like a kicked-over trifle!

908
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,344
Apologies to any ladies in with...

909
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:51,721
fannies like kicked-over trifles.

910
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:56,351
It's quite rough from here on in, people.

911
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,518
Strap in!

912
00:48:57,602 --> 00:49:00,021
Are there doctors in?
I know there's nurses.

913
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,773
Are there doctors and nurses?
Give us a shout, all of you.

914
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,192
-Quite a few of you around.

915
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,778
The thing that impresses me about doctors
is not what should impress me.

916
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,154
It's not the fact that
they can save lives.

917
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,322
That's what should impress me. No.

918
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:15,203
What impresses me about doctors
is their ability not to recoil in terror.

919
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,997
Doctors look at stuff every day.
They look at stuff and they go,

920
00:49:18,081 --> 00:49:20,375
"Oh, that's a bit...
It's a bit whiffy.

921
00:49:21,751 --> 00:49:23,252
It's a little bit gamey.

922
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:27,006
Oh, oh... I can...
I can smell that in my eyes.

923
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,928
We're gonna try and help you with that."

924
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,388
Ooh...

925
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:35,306
Whereas you or I would go,

926
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,100
"Why the fuck are you
showing me that, you monster?

927
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,851
Throw yourself off something!"

928
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,648
I asked a doctor recently,
I got chatting to this doctor.

929
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,818
I said, "What's the thing that's
made you want to recoil

930
00:49:46,901 --> 00:49:49,487
in terror the most in all your
years of doctoring?" Right?

931
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:50,697
And I thought he'd have to think about it.

932
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:53,533
Straightaway, he came back.
He went, "A 95-year-old vagina."

933
00:49:54,742 --> 00:49:57,120
I said, "I've seen one of those.

934
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:59,664
It was on a 30-year-old Scouse girl."

935
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:03,543
It's not the years,
it's the mileage, innit?

936
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:10,717
Oh, if you're watching this in America,
for "Scouse girl", read "New Jersey".

937
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:15,722
I've got a question for everyone in here.
Who here has had bad sex?

938
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:21,102
Who's not saying 'cause they're with
the person they had the bad sex with?

939
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,856
Have you ever had a girl cry during sex?
That's a weird thing.

940
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,608
I suppose women are more emotionally
engaged with their physical being.

941
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:30,153
That or the balaclava scared her.

942
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:34,866
Should we talk about
the weird shit people do sexually?

943
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,160
-Yes!
-Correct. We shall.

944
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:40,747
My ex-girlfriend used to like
to be choked during sex.

945
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:43,040
I'm 90% sure.

946
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:46,502
We only tried it once.

947
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:48,296
If anything, I was too good at it.

948
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:51,924
Have you all heard of the donkey punch?

949
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,384
Yeah!

950
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:54,969
The donkey punch
is where you're having the fun,

951
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,513
Greek-style bum sex
anal action with a lady, yeah?

952
00:50:57,597 --> 00:51:00,892
And just as you're about to finish,
nut, ejaculate, come, we're all clear.

953
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,060
Just as you're about to...

954
00:51:03,144 --> 00:51:05,772
You, um... You punch her
in the back of the head. Now...

955
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:09,192
Now I know that sounds
cray-cray in a bad way,

956
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,693
but hear me out.

957
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,487
Any medical professional will tell you,

958
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,071
when you punch someone
in the back of the head,

959
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,657
all the sphincters of the body,
of which your bum is one,

960
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,868
all the sphincters are on lockdown.
They all go, "Whoa!

961
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:22,330
The fuck was that? Whoa!"

962
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:25,124
It's like a submarine
locking off compartments. "Whoa!

963
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,293
No one in, no one out.
What the fuck? Whoa!"

964
00:51:28,044 --> 00:51:30,838
That "whoa" is a very fun way
to end proceedings.

965
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:34,425
Now obviously, you don't have to punch
your partner in the back of the head

966
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:35,593
to get that kind of result.

967
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:38,596
How long have you guys been together?
Five years?

968
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,932
So, a long-term, loving relationship.
Congratulations, guys.

969
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,975
So, sir, just turn,
look your partner in the eyes and say,

970
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:44,352
"Look, later on,
when I'm fucking you in the ass,

971
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,604
would you mind clenching
the sphincter of your anus

972
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:47,939
just as I'm about to ejaculate?"

973
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:50,107
Just have that conversation now. Just...

974
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:52,985
Away you go.

975
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:57,031
You're right not to, sir.
You're 100% right not to. It's...

976
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,534
Even after five years in a loving
relationship with a beautiful woman,

977
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,661
it's still too awkward a conversation.

978
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,287
Take your chances.

979
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,958
I don't know much about women,
but I know this.

980
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:09,502
It's easier to get forgiveness
than permission.

981
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:14,632
The seagull?
You all heard of the seagull?

982
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,467
It starts well and ends horrifically.

983
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,970
There's a pattern emerging here,
I'm sure you realise.

984
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:21,764
So this is where you're making love
to a lady on the beach, yeah?

985
00:52:21,848 --> 00:52:24,100
So everyone's melted away
at the end of a lovely summer's day.

986
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,352
And you find yourself under
the moon and the stars on the beach.

987
00:52:26,435 --> 00:52:27,520
So far, so good.

988
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:30,398
You decide to be spontaneous,
and make love to your partner. Fantastic.

989
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,900
The seagull is where you whip it out,
pop it in the sand,

990
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:34,318
and then stick it back in.

991
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,613
I know!

992
00:52:38,281 --> 00:52:41,534
It's called the seagull
because she goes...

993
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,372
Have I missed any? What other
kind of craziness have we heard of?

994
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:51,335
-What? Was that "angry pirate"?
-Yeah.

995
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:52,503
Angry pirate. Well, that's...

996
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,672
Okay, that's when a lady's
going down on you, and you decide,

997
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,341
"I'm not having enough fun.
I need more fun in my life."

998
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,760
So just as you're about to finish,
you pull out and come in her eye.

999
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,095
Not eyes. Eye.

1000
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:04,265
Singular. It's like a trick shot.

1001
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:06,100
And then as she gets up
to deal with that situation.

1002
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,103
"What's going on there?"
You then kick her in the shin.

1003
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,564
And what you're hoping for is the,
"Ar, ar, ar..."

1004
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,400
of the angry pirate.

1005
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,027
What other sexual weirdness
have we heard of?

1006
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:17,111
Spider-Man!

1007
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,281
The Spider-Man is a thing.
So, that's fairly vanilla.

1008
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:21,449
That's when you're behind a lady.

1009
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,909
That's key to the operation.
You're behind the lady,

1010
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,535
and you're working your magic.

1011
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,495
And then you... She's facing that way.
That's key.

1012
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,039
You pull out, catch.

1013
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,708
Women are inquisitive creatures.
She'll want to know

1014
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,001
what's going on.
"What's happening back there?"

1015
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,711
"Spider-Man!"

1016
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:37,715
There's a Spider-Man,
there's also a Superman.

1017
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,884
The Superman's where you come
across a lady's shoulder blades,

1018
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,261
grab a sheet, pop that down.

1019
00:53:43,179 --> 00:53:46,390
And then you're hoping
when she gets up, she has a cape.

1020
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,769
So, there's Spider-Man, Superman.
There's also a Batman.

1021
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:51,896
I was doing a show the other night,
and a bloke went, "Batman!"

1022
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,649
I said, "What's the Batman?"
He went, "Kill her parents."

1023
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,031
Teenage boys masturbate a lot.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1024
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:05,284
When I was a teenage boy,
I had a sock called the Dream Catcher.

1025
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:09,664
We're all familiar with
the danger wank, yes?

1026
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,916
Very much the preserve of the teenage boy.

1027
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,502
It's where you've taken matters
into your own hands.

1028
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:17,588
Some hand-to-gland combat.

1029
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:20,675
You're knocking one out,
having a wank.

1030
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,259
But you don't just want
the sexual gratification,

1031
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:23,719
you also want a frisson of excitement.

1032
00:54:23,803 --> 00:54:25,680
Some adrenaline pumping
through your veins.

1033
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,683
So mid-wank,
you call for someone in the house

1034
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,476
you do not have
a sexual relationship with,

1035
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,896
and then try and finish
said wank before they arrive.

1036
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,025
The classic, of course, "Mum! Mum!"

1037
00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:40,820
And then try and...
I mean, obviously, it could end in tears.

1038
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:42,905
You could end up glazing
your mum like a doughnut.

1039
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:50,454
Shall I just leave the phrase

1040
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:53,165
"glazing your mum like a doughnut"
hanging in the air?

1041
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:59,088
I've looked at so much Internet porn,
the virus my computer has is HIV.

1042
00:55:01,132 --> 00:55:03,926
We had a proper, serious, grown-up
discussion about pornography recently,

1043
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,303
and my girlfriend said, well,
some of you may share the sentiment.

1044
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,847
She said, "I don't get porn.

1045
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,142
Why would I want to watch
two people have sex?"

1046
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:13,102
I said, "Two?

1047
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,023
People?

1048
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:20,484
Now you've lost me."

1049
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,738
Has anyone here ever
looked at porn online?

1050
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:27,366
Oh, really? About 15 people?

1051
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,703
Well, what a statistical anomaly
you are, London.

1052
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:34,123
So I was looking at some
gentlemen's special interest material

1053
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:35,416
recently on the Internet,

1054
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:38,044
and this ad popped up
for a penis-enlargement cream.

1055
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:40,921
I thought, "Well, I'll read on.
I'm not buying a fucking Audi."

1056
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,048
Um...

1057
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:45,801
Basically it said, "Rub this cream
on your penis and it'll get bigger."

1058
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:47,136
I thought, "Well, I'll stop you there.

1059
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,929
Rub your penis without
the cream, it'll get bigger."

1060
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:53,642
That is the nature of rubbing and penises.
They bloody love it!

1061
00:55:55,061 --> 00:55:57,146
Second thing, if this stuff
actually worked, wouldn't the guy

1062
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,691
in the after photos in the advert
also have massive hands?

1063
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,112
He did not.

1064
00:56:05,196 --> 00:56:06,697
I got in trouble for a joke last year.

1065
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:08,991
Now, I don't mind getting
in trouble for a joke if it's worth it.

1066
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:10,451
If it's, like, a really edgy joke.

1067
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,078
I got in trouble
for a joke that's so mild.

1068
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:15,956
I said, "Deafness is getting
to be quite a problem for me.

1069
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,375
And I never thought
I'd hear myself say that."

1070
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:22,838
We got, like, 50 letters of complaint from
the National Association of the Deaf.

1071
00:56:22,922 --> 00:56:25,299
And what I wanna know is,
who told them?

1072
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,763
I said I was sorry.
Would they listen?

1073
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:35,434
I got talking to a North African girl
in her native language for hours.

1074
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:36,519
We just clicked.

1075
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,065
Fucking anthropology jokes.
I've got it all.

1076
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:44,735
I was gonna give you some advice,
ladies and gentlemen.

1077
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:45,820
Little bit of advice.

1078
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:49,281
If you get bitten by a dangerous dog,
like a Staffordshire bull terrier,

1079
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,158
any dog whose jaw locks when it bites you,

1080
00:56:51,242 --> 00:56:52,618
what you're meant to do
is stick a finger...

1081
00:56:52,701 --> 00:56:53,702
How can I put this politely?

1082
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:54,995
Up the ass.

1083
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:57,123
Now, key thing I was not made aware of,

1084
00:56:57,206 --> 00:57:00,042
it's got to be the dog's ass.

1085
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:04,505
Can't just be a passer-by
you like the look of.

1086
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,090
Or your own.

1087
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:09,051
Sharks.
Sharks are twice as likely,

1088
00:57:09,135 --> 00:57:12,388
twice as likely to bite a woman as a man.

1089
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,057
So, gentlemen,
if you're swimming with a woman,

1090
00:57:15,141 --> 00:57:16,851
and you see a shark,
here's what you do.

1091
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,229
You punch it as hard as you can
on the nose,

1092
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:22,189
and you throw it towards the shark.

1093
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:26,277
Here's some advice.
Women aren't meant to go camping

1094
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,736
when they've got their period,

1095
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,573
because what's the point in taking you
if you're not gonna fuck us?

1096
00:57:33,993 --> 00:57:35,661
It's a joke.

1097
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,205
They're actually worried if you're
menstruating and you go camping,

1098
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,708
you might attract a bear...

1099
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,711
and then bite its fucking head off
for no good reason.

1100
00:57:45,588 --> 00:57:48,549
It's basic bear safety is what it is.
Basic bear safety.

1101
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,761
That is, ladies and gentlemen,
pretty much my show.

1102
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:57,183
Oh, there is a collection after the show.
It's not a charity thing.

1103
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:58,434
It's not for my taxes.

1104
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:01,187
We're actually raising money
for a sex change operation

1105
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,689
for my brother. I don't want to go
into too much in the way of detail.

1106
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:07,151
Suffice it to say,
it is the ultimate practical joke.

1107
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,698
He's going to wake up
the day after his stag do,

1108
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:15,910
with a terrible hangover and amazing tits.
It's gonna be huge.

1109
00:58:17,495 --> 00:58:20,414
Now, should we... It's that sort of
stage of the evening. It's late on, right?

1110
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:23,167
-Should we try some rough stuff?
-Yeah!

1111
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,711
If you drink or smoke during pregnancy,

1112
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:27,254
you can lose the baby.

1113
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,965
It's worth a shot
before you splash out on another abortion.

1114
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:32,301
-Oh!

1115
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:35,054
Don't give me the "oh".
I'm not made of coat hangers, am I?

1116
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:39,683
That's divided the room, hasn't it?

1117
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:43,229
There's people that thought that was funny
and then there are good people.

1118
00:58:43,312 --> 00:58:44,813
Um...

1119
00:58:44,897 --> 00:58:46,774
I get away with murder in jokes.

1120
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:48,275
I think 'cause they're so clearly jokes.

1121
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:51,362
Feed line, punch line, laugh.
Possibly a "ooh".

1122
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,489
But it's so clearly a joke.
It's not an opinion.

1123
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:55,032
I'm not trying to change
your mind about anything.

1124
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:56,116
I'm just trying to make you laugh.

1125
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,327
But actually,
my dirty secret is, sometimes,

1126
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,871
when I'm at home writing jokes of a day,
I look back at what I've done,

1127
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:03,541
and I'll just go, "Well, that isn't
transgressive, or taboo, or edgy.

1128
00:59:03,624 --> 00:59:04,708
That's just wrong.

1129
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,710
That's just 100% wrong."

1130
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,712
And then, another bit of me,
quite a big bit, goes,

1131
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:09,964
"Yeah, funny though."

1132
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:13,926
If we're gonna be fancy about it,
it's cognitive dissonance.

1133
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:17,888
It's two opposing thoughts
in my head at the same time.

1134
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,015
I think, "It's wrong. It's funny."

1135
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,519
Is it okay to say something
that's 100% wrong if it's funny enough?

1136
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:24,687
Yeah!

1137
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,438
Well, you say that,
but it's not like 100% wrong

1138
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:29,775
where you'll go,
"What are you like? Cheeky!"

1139
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:32,361
You're much more likely to go "ugh".

1140
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,948
-Shall we give it a go?
-Yeah!

1141
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,157
Okay. If I was to say to you...

1142
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:39,368
It's about language being boring,
if it's about anything.

1143
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:41,996
If I was to say to you I was with a girl,
and she was really aroused.

1144
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,373
Well, firstly, you might be surprised.

1145
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:46,792
Secondly, bored.
That is a boring way of speaking.

1146
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:48,669
"I was with a girl.
She was really aroused."

1147
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:49,837
Boring.

1148
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,130
But if I was to say to you,

1149
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:54,341
"I was with a girl.
She was wetter than a spastic's chin!"

1150
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,975
That's the only difficult thing
about doing comedy,

1151
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,811
is to know where to draw the line, right?

1152
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:07,646
It's difficult to know
where to draw the line.

1153
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:10,024
I've got a friend of mine
whose father has Parkinson's.

1154
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:11,400
And I was chatting to him and his father.

1155
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:12,484
I was round at theirs, having tea,

1156
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,445
and they asked, they said,

1157
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,488
"Well, what can you joke about,
and what can't you joke about?

1158
01:00:16,572 --> 01:00:18,574
Would it be okay, for example,
to joke about Parkinson's?"

1159
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:20,659
And I was like, "Mmm..."

1160
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,291
It's quite funny when I say it.

1161
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:30,794
When his father tried to retell
that joke to his mum... Ha!

1162
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,506
I'd like to end the evening this evening

1163
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:37,801
Charlie Hebdo.

1164
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:39,136
I don't know if you're aware of them.

1165
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:42,598
They have a satirical magazine
in France, and they tell jokes.

1166
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,183
And because they tell jokes,

1167
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,977
some people that couldn't take
a fucking joke shot them.

1168
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:48,103
It's terrible.

1169
01:00:48,187 --> 01:00:50,522
I'd like to do a joke
in solidarity with those guys.

1170
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,816
-For the end of the gig. Yeah.

1171
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,236
Whenever I see footage of a mosque...

1172
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,867
Can anyone else feel
a tension in the room?

1173
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:05,329
Whenever I see footage of a mosque...

1174
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,289
This one's also for you,
Andreas, the Christian.

1175
01:01:08,499 --> 01:01:12,419
I like to think of myself
as an equal opportunities offender.

1176
01:01:12,503 --> 01:01:15,506
I don't care who your imaginary friend is.

1177
01:01:16,674 --> 01:01:19,426
I think it's all pretty fucking risible.

1178
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:21,387
Whenever I see footage of a mosque

1179
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:25,557
on the news or in a documentary,
everyone bowing their heads to pray,

1180
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:29,269
Guess Who?

1181
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:35,109
And someone's just said,
"Does he have a beard?"

1182
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,364
Listen, I've been Jimmy Carr.

1183
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:42,408
Thank you very much indeed.
Cheers. Good night. Thank you.
