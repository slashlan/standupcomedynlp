1
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:18,060
First of all,
thank you so much for doing this.

2
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:21,021
I know you're busy.
I was kind of embarrassed to ask you.

3
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,523
What do you need, exactly?
Because I'm...

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,193
Um, I want you to...

5
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,195
- You're gonna look into the camera.
- Right.

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,073
Get the audience really psyched up
to see me, a nice introduction.

7
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:33,492
Just get them really juiced
to have me coming out.

8
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,827
What about: "Ladies and gentlemen,

9
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,913
you are in the for the night
of your lives.

10
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,583
This next comedian makes Jerry Seinfeld
and Chris Rock look like rubbish.

11
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:44,962
George Carlin and Richard Pryor were shit
compared to him.

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,215
Please welcome the greatest comedian
in the world: Jim Norton."

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:52,177
Nah, it's just too much.
It's a little over the top.

14
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,804
- Is it?
- Yeah, too much.

15
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,014
- Oh.
- Kind of hard to believe all that.

16
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,643
Well, yeah. I was trying to big you up.
So...

17
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,854
Something a little bit less
pressure-inducing.

18
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,232
Right, okay. You don't want pressure.
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,150
I didn't realize you didn't want pressure

20
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,695
when doing a special on Netflix

21
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,155
that's gonna be seen
by millions of people.

22
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,907
But you don't want pressure.

23
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:15,492
- It should feel honest.
- Honest?

24
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:18,912
- Honest is important.
- Okay. Honest. Yeah, honest.

25
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:23,041
What about: "Please give it up
for the dirty, disgusting,

26
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:26,962
depraved little peeled turtle with AIDS,

27
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:31,133
the king of cum-guzzling himself,
Mr. Jim Norton."

28
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,596
- Too honest?
- Yeah? Sorry.

29
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,684
[sighs]

30
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,021
Hey, buddy. I've got a favor to ask you.

31
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,774
I'm shooting a special, and I'm looking
for someone to introduce me,

32
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,610
and I would love it to be you.

33
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,155
You'd just kind of say something nice
about me and bring me onstage.

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,781
If that would...

35
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,075
Look, I appreciate you doing this,

36
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,370
but it just doesn't seem
like you really mean any of it.

37
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:02,122
You don't believe what I just said?

38
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,795
Ladies and gentlemen, coming up
to the stage sometime soon,

39
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,839
in a little while, is Jim Norton.

40
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,800
- See? Right there. It's no good.
- What do you mean?

41
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,428
You don't sound like you mean it.
You've got to say it with conviction.

42
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,221
You're telling me how to deliver lines?

43
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:22,976
Your goal here is to get people
really happy and excited to see me.

44
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,395
I'm an actor. I'm not a fucking magician.

45
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,440
You don't like the way I did that? Huh?

46
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,983
I didn't say I didn't like it.

47
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,986
Stop being so nervous.

48
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,613
Do it again,
you fucking nervous little prick.

49
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:35,697
Go ahead, do it again.

50
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:38,200
- Your motivation should be...
- My motivation?

51
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,409
Should be...

52
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,996
Now say it again with conviction,
you ugly little slug.

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,499
Your motivation should be...

54
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,793
You dirty, nervous prick!

55
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,171
Jimmy, come on! You can do it!

56
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,633
Ladies and gentlemen,
do me a fucking favor

57
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,261
and please welcome Jim Norton!

58

Thank you very much for coming.
I really appreciate you being here.

How about that?

[audience cheering]

65
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:40,178
Robert De Niro spanked my bare ass.

66
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,975
I was sick the day we shot that,
and my whole fear, I was like,

67
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,228
"Please, don't shit on his hand.
Don't shit on his hand."

68
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:53,358
Look, I have a decent comedy career.
I'm doing stand-up over 20 years.

69
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:58,196
I'm not mainstream famous, obviously.
Kevin Hart is mainstream famous.

70
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,575
I have the type of fame where people
will see me, and they kind of...

71
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,618
Sometimes they know
they've seen me somewhere,

72
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,287
but they're not sure where.

73
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,788
It's never attractive women.

74
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:08,915
Even if they know me, they don't say it,
'cause they're not sure.

75
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,668
"Did I see him on stage somewhere,
or did he follow me home?"

76
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,878
I always have that...

77
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,173
"Did I see him on <i>Louie</i>
or in my bushes?"

78
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,928
But I don't know what you know
about comedians,

79
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,265
but there's nothing we hate more
than some random guy going,

80
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,184
"Dude, where do I know you from?"

81
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,686
The last thing I want to say is,
"I'm a comedian.

82
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,064
Oh, don't pick on me.
I'm gonna use you in my act, buster.

83
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,483
Come on, let's sit down."

84
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,280
It's repulsive. So, whenever someone says,
"Where do I know you from,"

85
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,491
I'll usually go,
"I think I sucked your dick.

86
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,370
You like it down to the root, right?
You like it down to the root?

87
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,707
Two fingers in the ass,
thumb on the balls. I know you.

88
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,502
Don't get mad, dude. I thought it was you.

89
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,129
Maybe it was your dad.
He looked like you. I apologize.

90
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,300
Don't get mad.
You tell me, do I look familiar?"

91
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,604
I feel so good.
I'm happy to be shooting in New York.

92
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,733
It's nice to be back home.
And I feel rested. I'm always tired.

93
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:19,486
I fell asleep last night, got eight hours,

94
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:24,324
had an amazing dream that Kim Kardashian
was sitting on my face

95
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,909
and just grinding.

96
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,913
Well, but then I woke up and realized
my nose was just stuffy.

97
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,336
I like a fat ass
more than a white guy is supposed to.

98
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,297
Black guys are supposed to like fat asses,

99
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,049
but I really like a big, fat ass.

100
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,593
But I tend to date small women.

101
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,680
So, it's awful when I see a big, fat ass
if I'm with a small girl,

102
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,266
and they're like, "That's disgusting."
Then I have to kind of sell out.

103
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,226
"Yeah, it's terrible.

104
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,770
Oh, that would feel awful,
those birthing hips.

105
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,148
I'd hate to hold onto those and slide in.
Ugh!

106
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,735
Oh, her pussy would probably grip you
like the mouth in <i>Aliens.</i>

107
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,404
Oh, disgusting!

108
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,367
How awful,
that soft flesh bouncing back against you.

109
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,037
I like your skeletal hips.
That's what I like, your skeletal...

110
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,958
Ass like a leukemia patient.
That's what turns me on.

111
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,128
Oh, I love it when you turn around
and go..."

112
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,838
[coughs]

113
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,806
I got into a fight recently.
I don't fight a lot.

114
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,434
I'm not a big guy,
so I really don't fight very much.

115
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,520
But I have a big mouth.
I won my fight, though.

116
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,148
I actually won the fight that I got into.

117
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,651
It was a guy.
He was a little drunk, I think.

118
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:44,529
He was in a store,
and I just overheard him,

119
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,323
and I couldn't help myself.

120
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,907
He had a fedora on.

121
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,077
And he's talking to the salesgirl,

122
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,371
and he's like, "What do you think
I should wear with this?"

123
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,831
And I said, "A rope."

124
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,590
Which is actually
very sound fashion advice.

125
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,718
But he grabbed my shirt.
That's why I think he was drunk.

126
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,471
He grabbed my shirt, and he's like,
"What did you say?"

127
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,681
And I was like, "I'm gonna cum."

128
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,232
Then he gave up immediately.

129
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,319
Too late, unfortunately.

130
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,993
Guys are so homophobic.
It's really funny to me.

131
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,956
We use a homophobic thing
to make each other uncomfortable,

132
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:37,958
to dominate each other
when we're growing up.

133
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,670
You remember ten or 11 years old,
you'd be sitting at your friend's house,

134
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,463
watching TV in the living room,

135
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,550
and then he'd just walk in out of nowhere
and start humping the side of your face?

136
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,803
Remember?

137
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,904
I still do shit like that.
It's still fun to fuck with your friends.

138
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:11,241
I walked into a public restroom,
and a buddy of mine was at the urinal,

139
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,743
and you gotta do something
when your friend's at the urinal.

140
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,830
You just gotta fuck with him a little bit.
He didn't hear me walk in,

141
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:21,918
so I snuck up behind him very quietly
and I stood about an inch behind him,

142
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:26,297
and then I put my mouth right behind
his neck hair, and I just went...

143
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,383
[deep voice]
"Hey!"

144
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,931
And he freaked out,
and it wasn't my friend.

145
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,062
Yet.

146
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,233
Do you know how hard that is
to explain to a stranger,

147
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,610
why you just spoke onto his neck?

148
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:54,325
Oh, man. I feel great.
I feel really, really good.

149
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:58,621
Life has just been good lately.
And it's so funny,

150
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,374
'cause you find things you like
as you get older.

151
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,794
I'm in my 40's now, so you find shit
that makes you feel good.

152
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,048
Like, I have a hatred
of somebody telling me a story,

153
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,634
and at one point in the story, you know
how they ask you to guess at part of...

154
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,386
It's usually because the story is shit,

155
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,682
and they think that your guess
will propel their story into interesting.

156
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,310
They'll say, "Guess how many?"
Then you guess the number,

157
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,770
and then they tell you the real number,

158
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,147
and you're like, "Holy shit!
I should've guessed..."

159
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,901
I've begun over-guessing on purpose

160
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,737
just to totally destroy the momentum
of the story.

161
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:34,866
Once you do it, you'll never not do it.
And I know I'm a piece of shit

162
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,285
for robbing little victories
from all my friends.

163
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,204
Fuck them. Their stories are terrible.

164
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:44,292
My manager Jonathan... I love him,
but he does this to me all the time.

165
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,670
He bought a watch,
and he paid 1,500 bucks for the watch.

166
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,549
And if he had just said, "I paid 1,500
for this watch, but it's worth 2,000,"

167
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,009
I would've been impressed.

168
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,845
I would've been like,
"Oh, cool, you saved 500 bucks."

169
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,390
But he tried to have,
like, a "holy shit" moment with it.

170
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,184
He's like,
"Dude, I paid 1,500 for this watch.

171
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,560
Guess how much it's worth."

172
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,564
"I don't know.
A hundred-and-thirty-thousand?"

173
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,696
And I'm still giddy at the memory

174
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,200
of that stupid fucking smile
melting off his face.

175
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,913
'Cause now his real number
has no impact whatsoever.

176
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,918
Like, I guessed 130,000.
He can't go, "No. 2,000."

177
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,879
"Oh, hey,
that's a heck of a savings, too!"

178
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:34,259
Fucking shoot yourself.
Your story was terrible.

179
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,889
And I started doing it...
It's weird. I begun...

180
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:43,309
The joy of over-guessing,
I discovered by accident.

181
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,521
I was trying to do the right thing.
A friend of mine is really fat.

182
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,732
Wouldn't it be great
if I just left it right there?

183
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,068
"A friend of mine is fat"
and moved on to something else.

184
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,487
Like, that was just me talking to him.
"You know who you are."

185
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,535
A friend of mine is really fat.
He started losing weight, which was great,

186
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,538
but instead of just letting
somebody notice it,

187
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,624
he told us that he lost weight,
which was kind of awkward

188
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,168
'cause it wasn't really noticeable yet.

189
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,837
He's like, "Dude, I lost some weight."
In my mind, I'm like, "Allegedly."

190
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,839
I didn't see evidence of that at all.

191
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:19,262
But then he puts me on the spot.
He's like, "Guess how many pounds."

192
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,724
And I don't want to be a scumbag.
"Uh, point..."

193
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:29,564
So, in an effort to be nice,
I over-guessed. I was like, "50?"

194
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,858
He was like, "No. Six."

195
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,695
And I realized that by over-guessing,

196
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,324
I had totally robbed him of that moment
and made him feel horrible.

197
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,451
And it made me so fucking happy.

198
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,205
I feel so good.
I don't know how to handle feeling...

199
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,459
I don't know how to live feeling good.
I'm so not used to it.

200
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,170
I go through my depression, though,
like everybody else.

201
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:56,215
I go through my feeling like shit.
You ever get suicidal thoughts? Anybody?

202
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,717
[man] Oh, yeah.

203
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,679
That was a very fast...
Whenever you say "suicidal thoughts,"

204
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,848
you never want the answer
to be that quick.

205
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:05,183
"Yes!"

206
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,020
Hope you're not on a first date.
That's the wrong time.

207
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,481
"I've wanted to kill myself
and everyone else in the theater."

208
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,690
Oh, good. That's...

209
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:18,863
But it's weird how sneaky it is
and how it hits you out of nowhere.

210
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,114
You're not prepared for it.

211
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,241
Things are great, then all of a sudden,
your voice, like...

212
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:24,243
"You forgot to hang yourself."
"What?"

213
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,666
I'm not trying to bum everybody out.
It goes away in six months.

214
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,047
And I don't want to kill myself,

215
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,217
but I've kind of come
to a peaceful conclusion,

216
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,638
that if I ever do decide to kill myself,
I'm gonna go out in style.

217
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:48,685
And before I do it, I want to write a note
blaming someone I hardly know.

218
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:59,112
How hilarious would that be, just to wreck
somebody's life for no reason whatsoever?

219
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,864
But it's got to be totally random.

220
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:05,743
Pick some guy at work
you've talked to once in eight years.

221
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,955
Not even a guy from your department.
Just make it, you know...

222
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,499
"Murray in Human Resources
will know what this is about."

223
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,668
And fucking hang yourself.

224
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,425
For the rest of his life, Murray will be
all fucked up and socially awkward.

225
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,469
"I don't know.
I said hi to the guy once in 2014."

226
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,979
I'm a terrible liar.
I'm a very, very bad liar.

227
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,313
And I wish I was better,

228
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,691
'cause it's hard for me
to be good in relationships.

229
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:39,986
So, the fact is,
I just give myself away when I'm lying.

230
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,156
I always feel like it's obvious.
Some guys are literally masters of lying.

231
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,284
Your girl could walk in
and catch you fucking one of her friends.

232
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,286
"What are you doing?"
"She fell, baby. I was picking her up."

233
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,040
Just so smooth.
And I admire your ability to do that,

234
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,125
because I just... my eyes get wide.

235
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,628
I sound like an actor from the 1940s
if I'm texting the wrong person.

236
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,089
"Who is that?"
"It's a buddy, see? Ahh."

237
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,677
Fucking throw the phone into the tub.

238
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,929
"Nothing to see there, chum. Ahh."

239
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,352
Have you ever been such a bad liar

240
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,813
that you try to lie
by just telling the truth

241
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,024
with a sarcastic inflection in your voice,

242
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,151
'cause it feels less like a lie?

243
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:21,861
Like, if your girlfriend knows
you cheated on her.

244
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,029
"Did you have sex with her?"

245
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,364
"Yeah!

246
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:29,160
Oh, yeah, yeah. I fucked her twice
while you were in the hospital."

247
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,042
That reads pretty honest in a transcript.

248
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:47,678
My ex-girlfriend caught me.
I got busted so badly.

249
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,431
Has anybody ever gotten busted talking
to someone you shouldn't be?

250
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,643
Because it's in black-and-white...

251
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,852
Here's what it was.

252
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,148
One morning, I was having
a nasty conversation with a girl,

253
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,691
who I had met one time.

254
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,193
And that's what we do now
in the digital era.

255
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,530
You talk to people who you probably
wouldn't talk to before,

256
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,989
because you can just do it
on your cell phone.

257
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:12,495
And it was one of those three-hour,
lathered-up, fucking filthy...

258
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,666
I was offering her $500 to come over
and stick her feet in my mouth.

259
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,252
Which, you know, obviously,
I would never do that.

260
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,004
Three-fifty is the cutoff
for foot worship. Everybody knows that.

261
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,258
But I was talking to this girl Maria.

262
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,718
And again, we'd never hung out.
We'd only met one time.

263
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:30,304
But it was a three-hour...

264
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:33,599
I was so finished.
I just jerked off and fell asleep.

265
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,435
I didn't even clean up
until the next morning.

266
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:39,021
Literally, I sounded like a Fruit Roll-Up
when I was pulling my...

267
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,858
[tearing sound]

268
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,240
This is 2011.
I remember this like it was yesterday,

269
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,368
'cause my girlfriend at the time walked
into the bedroom,

270
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,996
and she goes, "Get up, Jim."

271
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,291
You know how you know you're fucked
for some...

272
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,960
The tone of voice implies
this is not gonna be great news.

273
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,796
"Get up, Jim." I'm like, "What?"

274
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,215
I don't know why that was my impression
of myself waking up.

275
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,050
"Wha..." I don't talk like that.

276
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,635
See, I overact, even in real life.

277
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:10,970
[mumbling]
"Wha..."

278
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,931
I'm like, "What?" And she says,

279
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,268
"I know about your fucking conversation
with Maria last night."

280
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,479
And I'm a little freaked out,
but I look over,

281
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,482
and my phone is exactly where I left it
the night before.

282
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,025
I'm like, "I don't know
what you're talking about."

283
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,487
She's like, "$500 to lick her feet,
you piece of shit?"

284
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,741
So, now I know she knows.
Either that or she's an amazing guesser.

285
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,998
But I wish I would've improv'd
that line I did before:

286
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,750
"Hey, I wouldn't go over 350
for foot worship."

287
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,295
Ha ha! Elbowed her.
Ohh, we'd have made love.

288
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:48,382
But I knew I was caught somehow.
I didn't know how she knew.

289
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,092
But you know how it is
when you get caught.

290
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:52,470
I'm just like, "I'm sorry.
I'm a sex addict. I don't know."

291
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,639
There's no way to fish for information

292
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,432
when you're trying
to save your relationship.

293
00:16:56,516 --> 00:17:00,228
I couldn't go, "Baby, I love you.
How did you know, for future reference?"

294
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,109
Here's how she knew.
She told me how she knew.

295
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,695
'Cause none of us are as smart
as we think we are.

296
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,157
None of us understand the technology
as well as we think we do.

297
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:16,536
And we're all on Wi-Fi,
and all the devices are connected.

298
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,663
And I was in this chat,
and I'm lathered up.

299
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,999
I only have one hand to use on the phone,
obviously.

300
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,125
I hit the wrong button

301
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,921
and I printed the entire conversation
in the living room...

302
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,382
a seven-page PDF file.

303
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,096
Clear, too,
'cause I'd just put in fresh ink.

304
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,556
It was very readable.

305
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:43,521
And by a terrible coincidence,
she needed the printer the next morning,

306
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,274
'cause she was taking a college course
at the time.

307
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,817
She was very advanced for her age.

308
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:54,657
So, she takes this conversation out
of the printer,

309
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,037
and the paper she wrote,
and she heads off to class with this.

310
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:04,792
And this is absolutely the truth.
Thank God she didn't hand it in.

311
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,294
'Cause she was crazy.

312
00:18:06,377 --> 00:18:09,880
I firmly believe she would've woken me up
by putting a knife in my stomach.

313
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,090
She would not have been...

314
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,176
But it would've been a funnier joke.
There's no funny part.

315
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,346
It would've been a much cleverer joke
if she had handed it in, and I would've...

316
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,724
"I got an A. She got a C. Hey-oh!"

317
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,398
The truth itself is not funny.
It's just sad.

318
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,609
The way it played out was
she read the text,

319
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,569
and she felt really betrayed,
and she cried.

320
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,653
[mock crying]

321
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:33,738
You know?

322
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,492
That's what I'll do.
I'll jazz it up with one of those.

323
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,411
"Got a lot of..." you know?

324
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,914
But I kind of regret it.

325
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,501
You've got to be so careful what you say
and what you put in text,

326
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,755
because this day and age, anything you do
can fucking ruin your life.

327
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,007
You've got to be so scared
of every text you send,

328
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,177
every dirty picture you send,
everything you put on Snapchat.

329
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,138
I mean, I'll tell you
who has struck a blow for privacy.

330
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,390
Hulk Hogan did more for privacy

331
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,352
than any shitty politician has done
in the last ten years

332
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,937
'cause he sued Gawker out of existence.

333
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,190
And that was a very big thing.
You guys know the story.

334
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,818
Hulk was fucking that woman.
He did not know he was being filmed.

335
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:18,115
And Gawker, I guess, put a link to it up,
and he says it ruined his life.

336
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,910
I think there was racist language
or something.

337
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,579
I guess at the time,
Brooke was dating a black guy,

338
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,374
and I guess Hulk was none too pleased.

339
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,002
And apparently he said the word "nigger"
so many times

340
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:32,171
that Dog the Bounty Hunter hung up
on him.

341
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,512
So, WWE fired him,
and he said it ruined his life.

342
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,596
But I'll be honest.

343
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,598
I'm a bigger Hulk Hogan fan now
than I've never been.

344
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,767
Did you see the cock on Hulk Hogan?

345
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:47,770
I ran out and bought
a little yellow headband.

346
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,397
I'm a Hulkamaniac.

347
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,526
Jesus Christ. I never understood
why that stupid leg drop

348
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,361
was such an effective finishing move.

349
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,869
But now I'm just amazed nobody was killed

350
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,539
with that Civil War cannon strapped
to his leg.

351
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,000
"I'm gonna rip your asshole apart,
brother!"

352
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,546
Thank you. That's my Hulk Hogan.

353
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,673
That's what you do when you can't do
an impression as a comedian.

354
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,342
You just jazz it up by moving funny.
You like Christopher Walken?

355
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,720
"Oh! You know, my watch. Ow!"

356
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,058
You name a person, I'll do him.
I don't care. I do good.

357
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,687
I thought you were gonna name somebody.
Okay.

358
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,565
[woman] Oprah!

359
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,402
Oprah? Worst guess ever.

360
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,198
You got to watch it. I was bummed
I fucked up that relationship,

361
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,409
because that girl, she was dirty, man.

362
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,828
She would, like, lick my ass.
She was a trooper.

363
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,539
Every guy likes their ass eaten.

364
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,375
Let's not pretend that I'm the only one
who likes their ass licked.

365
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,170
Here's why that did not get
the rousing round of applause

366
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,838
that ass-eating does deserve.

367
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,717
Literally...
No, you don't have to do it now.

368
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,386
But whenever someone mentions ass-eating,
here's what people ought to do:

369
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,932
"Hold on. Let me put my drink down
and applaud for the idea of ass-eating."

370
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,393
[scattered applause]

371
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:10,519
No, no, no.

372
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:12,730
Hey. Easy.

373
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,775
She would eat my ass, and she would...

374
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,985
Look, here's the thing
with getting your ass licked.

375
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,069
It's...

376
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,656
It's embarrassing to ask for.

377
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,366
There's nothing worse than asking
for something

378
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,953
and having a girl go, "No."
Then you're ashamed of liking it.

379
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,956
If you want a girl to suck your dick,
you might go, "Come on, suck my dick."

380
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,751
And if she says no, then you can
kind of coax her a little bit.

381
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,252
Like, "Come on, suck my dick.

382
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,464
Eh? How about it?"

383
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,595
But it's embarrassing if you're like,

384
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,474
"Come on, just lick my ass a little bit."
"No."

385
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,185
"Come on, what are you doing?
Just get back there and eat it.

386
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,731
Part the hair with a comb
and slam your face in there.

387
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,274
What are you doing?

388
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,570
You're gonna feel like you're kissing
the scalp of a marathon runner.

389
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,239
Get in there, you silly goose."

390
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,621
So, you gotta kind of hint at it.

391
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:14,166
'Cause you can't be ashamed
about something if you're hinting.

392
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,502
So, say your girlfriend
is sucking your dick,

393
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,296
and she pops it out
and she's, like, licking the back.

394
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,131
Exaggeration, obviously.

395
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,053
What do you want, truth in comedy?
All right, so, she's licking the...

396
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,437
"What is he doing?
Is he sealing an envelope

397
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,274
or rolling a joint?
I don't understand."

398
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,406
But if you hint at something,
there's no shame in it

399
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:46,615
'cause they can't reject it.

400
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:50,160
So, if your girlfriend is giving you head,
you start raising your hips...

401
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,413
just a little bit. And moaning.
Get a little help, like...

402
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,872
[moaning]

403
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,628
Your balls will slowly drag over her face
like a street sweeper.

404
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,302
Then they're finally just sitting
on her forehead.

405
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,220
She looks like Tiberius Caesar.

406
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,975
She's like, "All right, I get it.
You want your ass licked. Got it."

407
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,145
And then they always do
that little tester lick on your asshole.

408
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,229
Just a little...

409
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,524
You ever lick an asshole?
It's like testing a battery.

410
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:32,244
And I'm gonna brag a little.
My asshole passes with flying colors.

411
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:37,082
My asshole is like two immaculate,
hairless peach halves.

412
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,293
And that's exactly how I describe it
on PlentyOfFish.

413
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,714
"Two immaculate, hairless peach halves,

414
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,466
just meant for nuzzling."

415
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,804
But I'm a dirty guy. I'm a dirty person.

416
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,640
And it's funny.

417
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,266
My whole career... for those of you
who are familiar with me...

418
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,270
I've always said, "I'm a pervert."
But I'm not a pervert.

419
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,856
'Cause a pervert implies
you like a victim,

420
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,483
or you like tricking people.

421
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:06,695
And I realized that recently.
I don't like anybody vulnerable in sex.

422
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,698
I don't like drunk girls.
I don't like underage girls.

423
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,034
I don't have sex with children.

424
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,994
And I don't why more men
don't talk about that.

425
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,412
That's my best quality.

426
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:22,419
I don't like virgins. I don't like women
who've only been with a couple of guys,

427
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,464
'cause then it means too much to them,
and I know I'm kind of a piece of shit.

428
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,926
So, I don't want a girl to look at me
with puppy love,

429
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,637
just kissing it like,
"You're so special.

430
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,431
Do you love me, too?
Oh, my God. I'm so happy."

431
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,393
I want a girl to look at my dick and go,
"Ugh, I wish it was black,"

432
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,436
and then blow a snot rocket on it.

433
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,783
Jared Fogle is a pervert.

434
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,077
How do you fuck up the Subway endorsement?

435
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,747
Jared's whole job was
to hold up those big, fat-fuck pants.

436
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,124
That was his job.

437
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:04,545
All he had to do to stay really rich:
Don't get fat, don't fuck kids.

438
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,963
How hard is that?

439
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,549
I could do that in my sleep.

440
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,009
If you just it say to yourself
on the way out the door...

441
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,762
"Don't get fat and don't fuck kids.
Don't get fat...

442
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,016
don't fuck kids.
Don't get fat, don't fuck kids."

443
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,856
But it's amazing how many people...

444
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,650
you realize their sexual behavior
is so fucked up.

445
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:29,278
Obviously, Cosby.
I love his new excuse now.

446
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,905
"I couldn't have committed those rapes.
I'm blind now."

447
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,282
Oh, that's how it works.

448
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,370
And I feel really bad for his wife,
Nelson Mandela.

449
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,831
Jesus.

450
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,506
But you knew Cosby was guilty
when Oprah...

451
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,300
Oprah. You got me on fucking Oprah.

452
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,515
You knew Cosby was guilty when
Whoopi Goldberg stopped defending him.

453
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:01,685
Whoopi defended him for years,
and then finally she had to...

454
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,353
But first of all,
what happened to Whoopi Goldberg?

455
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:05,939
She looks like KRS-One now.
What the fuck happened to her?

456
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,241
And a lot of those women...
Here's what tells you that he did it.

457
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,285
A lot of those women
were in their 70s,

458
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,496
and 70-year-old women just don't lie
about rape.

459
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,706
I'm not saying that young women are liars,

460
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,875
but women that old
don't ever talk about sex.

461
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,251
They don't lie about sex.

462
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:28,754
Seventy-year-old women lie
about other shit.

463
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,340
"My grandson called."

464
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,679
"Fuck you, liar. No, he didn't.

465
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,226
It was a wrong number, and you kept him
on the phone for an hour and a half.

466
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,144
You lying old bag!"

467
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,902
But you try to find something good
in everything.

468
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,571
And the wonderful thing
about that relationship ending

469
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:56,365
was that it forced me
to start working out

470
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,367
'cause I knew I was gonna have
to meet women again.

471
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,785
And I lost a lot of weight.

472
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,454
Has anybody lost weight
in the last few years?

473
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:03,956
How much weight did you lose?

474
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:07,376
[man] I lost 100 pounds.
I lost 100 pounds.

475
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,294
What? You lost 100 pounds?

476
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,463
Jeez. What, did you drown your girlfriend?
What happened?

477
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,556
- How'd you lose 100 pounds?
- I don't work out. I just...

478
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,267
You don't work out? Come on.
You mean that's natural?

479
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,939
That's like me saying,
"I don't play center for the Lakers."

480
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,357
No shit, stupid.

481
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,737
When you start losing weight,
here's the thing.

482
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,156
A hundred pounds, congratulations.
That's awesome.

483
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,367
Oh, yeah. Give him a hand.

484
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,707
The weird thing is,
I lost about 30 pounds over the years,

485
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,250
and when you start losing weight,

486
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,920
the first five or six or ten pounds,
people are like, "Wow, you look great."

487
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:56,592
But after you lose, like, 15 pounds,
people don't know how to respond.

488
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,677
Twenty pounds, they're like,
"Uh...

489
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:04,266
have you been dieting,
or did Charlie Sheen bleed in your mouth?"

490
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,649
Is it okay to joke about Charlie?

491
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,361
Was anybody shocked when he announced
he was HIV-positive? No.

492
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:17,613
I like Charlie Sheen,

493
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,365
but that's how you know
you've lived a pretty AIDSy life...

494
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,952
when you're that famous
and you're like, "I'm HIV-positive,"

495
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,121
and the whole country is like,
"Well, yeah, I hope so."

496
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,708
For Pete's sake.

497
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:36,256
I gotta be honest.
Charlie's HIV diagnosis really scared me.

498
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,759
It really shook me because...

499
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,595
I don't know Charlie.
We've never met, never hung out.

500
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,888
But it just kind of rocked me,

501
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,140
and I started thinking
about my sexual behavior.

502
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:47,476
Even though we've never met,
Charlie and I have had sex

503
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,604
with, I think, four of the same people.

504
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,065
And there's only one
I can mention publicly

505
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,150
because she and I
have discussed it publicly,

506
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,610
and I don't ever want to out people.

507
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,738
But for many years on the radio,
we would interview Bree Olson.

508
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,740
Bree would come in.
If you don't know Bree,

509
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,659
she's a beautiful blond porn star.

510
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,703
She's fun. She's really sexy,
and whenever she was on our show,

511
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,163
she'd always flirt with me.

512
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,207
She'd always be like, "I like you.
You're really cute."

513
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,875
And I was always like,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."

514
00:29:11,959 --> 00:29:14,378
'Cause I thought she was just doing it
for the radio.

515
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,130
She's probably thinking,
"This guy is blowing me off,"

516
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,634
but meanwhile, I just have no self-esteem.
I'm just like, "Oh, come on."

517
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,513
She thinks I'm too cool for the room.
Meanwhile, I feel like the Elephant Man

518
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,182
when he has the tuxedo on
in front of British high society.

519
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,560
[slurring] "Everybody's been so kind!"

520
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:40,112
But one day, her publicist says to me,
"No, Bree actually likes you.

521
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,655
She's not joking."

522
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:47,119
And whatever cool, detached attitude
I had built up evaporated.

523
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,247
I was at Bree's hotel
in less than an hour. Like, really...

524
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,790
"Hi!"

525
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:56,586
This close to the fucking,
you know... peephole.

526
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,214
You think my face is unpleasant now?
Look at it through the hole.

527
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,465
It's just a fucking...

528
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,802
stupid half a moon.

529
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,096
And we fucked. And I gotta be honest.

530
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,975
It's one of the most earthshattering
sexual experiences I've ever had.

531
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,310
It was beautiful.

532
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:14,104
And I don't think
that she enjoyed it as much...

533
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,690
'cause she would never do it again.

534
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,609
I tried for years to make it happen again.
I would text her, "What are you doing?"

535
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,528
She'd write back,
"Anything but fucking you."

536
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,696
It just was...

537
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,908
I think I blew it. Let me ask you,

538
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,286
is it a turn-off to say "I love you"
too quickly?

539
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,247
All right, let me ask the women.
Is it a turn-off

540
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,375
if the first time you fuck a guy,
as he's putting it in,

541
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:38,086
he's mumbling,
"I love you, I love you, I love you,"

542
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,714
and crying onto your face?
Is that a turn-off?

543
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,927
And I was talking to a buddy of mine.
He was like, "Did you wear a condom?"

544
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,847
I'm like, "What a cute question.
No, stupid. I didn't.

545
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,017
When you're getting into a Lamborghini,
you don't put on a body bag, do you?"

546
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,361
I wouldn't have worn a condom
if I looked into her pussy

547
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,988
and saw Magic Johnson waving up at me.

548
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,337
So, then, you fast-forward.
We have sex. She goes out to LA.

549
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,089
She dates Charlie Sheen at one point.

550
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:25,133
Then all of a sudden, Charlie comes out
and announces he's HIV-positive.

551
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,385
So, I just backtracked a little bit.

552
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,012
I'm like, "Oh, no,
did I get the whole ball rolling?

553
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,267
Oh, no, I gave AIDS
to the guy from <i>Platoon.</i>

554
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,769
I'm a piece of shit."

555
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:41,066
But luckily, Bree Olson has been tested
multiple times.

556
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:44,361
She does not have HIV.
She is totally negative,

557
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,696
which means I'm HIV-negative.

558
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,574
Yeah, that's how I take an AIDS test.

559
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,121
I'm too freaked out to go to the doctor,

560
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,248
so I just fuck a girl
and then see her in a year,

561
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,416
and, you know...

562
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,293
"Hey, how are you?"

563
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,254
"I'm great." "Makes two of us."

564
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:08,343
She had the strength to smile.

565
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,720
That's six more months of no rubbers
for the kid.

566
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,356
And it's hard for me to meet people,
to be really honest with you,

567
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,526
because I've talked about myself
so much publicly.

568
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,112
People know so many things about me,
and none of it's a secret.

569
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,865
Anybody familiar with me
knows I like transgender girls.

570
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,658
That's not new information.

571
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:33,827
And if it is, well, now you have it.

572
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,331
But it's so funny.
The whole country is, like, trans-crazy,

573
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,708
and we're really obsessed with it,

574
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,835
and it's so funny how
when the new thing happens

575
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,463
or becomes in the lexicon,

576
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:46,756
you can't joke about it on TV.

577
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,675
I tried to do a Caitlyn Jenner joke,

578
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,886
and the network said,
"Oh, no transition jokes."

579
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,345
I'm like, "It's not even a mean joke."

580
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,972
They're like,
"Yeah, but we just don't like it.

581
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,765
They've been marginalized."

582
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:57,684
I'm like, "Look, just 'cause
you've been marginalized

583
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,312
doesn't mean that you're removed
from the humor spectrum

584
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,480
like everybody else."

585
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:06,151
It wasn't even a mean joke. First of all,
the network canceled her reality show.

586
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,236
How shitty is your reality show

587
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,572
when you were on a Wheaties box,
you're now a woman,

588
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,908
you were a Kardashian,
you killed somebody driving,

589
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:15,619
and the network goes, "It's boring.
There's nothing happening to talk about"?

590
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,213
And I think Hollywood means well.
Their hearts are in the right place.

591
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:29,299
But it's a little bit phony.
Some of it is just a little bit fake.

592
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,511
You know how they can't talk about Caitlyn
without saying how beautiful she is?

593
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,804
"Have you seen how beautiful Caitlyn is?"

594
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:36,932
No.

595
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,644
She looks like the gypsy from <i>Thinner.</i>

596
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,986
But it's so funny.

597
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,366
Not one of these freethinking,
progressive celebrities

598
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,785
who always use the right pronoun,

599
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,746
not one of them has admitted to having sex
with a transgender girl,

600
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,916
to watching trans porn,
to being attracted to trans women.

601
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,169
Not one of them. That's being supportive.

602
00:34:06,253 --> 00:34:09,047
Don't tell me what words to use.
You want to support a young lady?

603
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:12,592
You lift her skirt, you suck her cock.
That's how you say, "I'm with you."

604
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,724
Don't tell me what to joke about until
you've laid in bed with a sore asshole,

605
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,309
mumbling, "Who am I?"

606
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,022
You ever brush your teeth

607
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:28,525
and scream "faggot" in the mirror
for a half hour?

608
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,111
I have.

609
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,954
And I know why they won't talk about it.
I know why they won't admit it.

610
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,581
'Cause they don't know
if it makes you gay.

611
00:34:42,664 --> 00:34:44,457
"If I have sex with a trans girl,
does that make..."

612
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,377
It does not make you gay
to have sex with a trans girl.

613
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,719
But even if it did, I would tell you.
I wouldn't care.

614
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,638
But I understand
why certain people think it does.

615
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:01,600
We can't be so pro-trans
or politically correct

616
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,644
that we forget that differing opinions
are gonna pop up.

617
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,938
An open and honest conversation
doesn't mean

618
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,983
that you just shut down somebody
when they say unpleasant shit.

619
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:13,612
I get why some guys think it's gay.
But it's just not. Until you've done it...

620
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,655
Like, when you kiss,
it's a feminine energy.

621
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,283
It's not a masculine energy,
or it wouldn't turn me on.

622
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,036
The breasts are normally fake,
but so what?

623
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,079
Every stripper I ever fell in love with
had fake tits.

624
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,790
That never turned me off. I never
threw a girl out of the Champagne Room.

625
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,043
"Beat it with your augmented bosoms,
madam!"

626
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,464
You know, then the skirt comes up.

627
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,591
All right.

628
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,093
It's a large clitoris.

629
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:42,182
But what, am I gonna be rude to my guest?
Get over here.

630
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,100
[grunting]

631
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,644
[popping sounds]

632
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,148
Just look at the breasts, that's all.

633
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,900
If you're new to the game,
look at the breasts.

634
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,152
"Oh, I love her so much. I love her."

635
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,738
If it's your first time at the rodeo,
don't look at the feet.

636
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,114
That'll put the whammy on you.

637
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,287
"Oh, no, those feet scored 13 points
in the fourth quarter.

638
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,705
I'm fucking gay."

639
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:07,082
[grunting]

640
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:16,216
And it's funny, too... I've talked
to a lot of trans girls about...

641
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:19,010
One girl told me that,
just to feel feminine as a kid,

642
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,388
she used to wear her mother's underwear.

643
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,889
Whew.

644
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,934
That one affected me.
I mean, your mother's underpants.

645
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:29,312
I don't care what gender you are.
Is there a worse item in the house...

646
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,191
than your mother's underpants?

647
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,734
I wouldn't touch my mother's underpants

648
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:37,529
if she was hanging off a bridge
by her underpants.

649
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,451
I'd probably just blow her a kiss
and then step on her fucking fingers.

650
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,997
Did you ever see your mom's panties
on the floor?

651
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:50,333
You gotta take a stick
and knock them under the dresser.

652
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,129
Can you imagine putting those on?

653
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,507
I'd rather wear my father's used condom
on my nose like an aardvark.

654
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,436
I saw one pair of my mom's panties
when I was a kid.

655
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,772
Thank God they weren't sexy at all.

656
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:15,066
I feel bad for any kid
that has the hot mom

657
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,735
who all his friends want to fuck.

658
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:20,447
We all had that one friend,
everyone wanted to fuck his mother.

659
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,949
And that's gotta be awful
to find your mom's panties,

660
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,327
and it's just a pair of boy shorts
with a little arrow in the back.

661
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:27,662
Like, "Ugh.

662
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,873
Oh, no. Mom's a three-holer."

663
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,836
My mom's panties were awful.

664
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,255
They started at the middle of the chest.

665
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,048
They ended right above the knee.

666
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:41,593
It looked like an androgynous bathing suit
on <i>Boardwalk Empire.</i>

667
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,303
That's what you want your mother...

668
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,639
If you see your mother in her panties,
you want to start thinking,

669
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:49,350
<i>"♪ Hello, my ragtime gal ♪"</i>

670
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,938
You don't want to think
about your parents sexually at all.

671
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,107
You know your parents fuck
because we're all alive,

672
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:57,233
so we're evidence of it.

673
00:37:57,317 --> 00:38:00,236
But my parents told me,
like, when I asked about it,

674
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,947
they said, "We just made love
because we wanted to create you

675
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:05,658
and we wanted to create your sister Tracy.
That's the only reason."

676
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:09,078
So, they made it look like it was purely
something they suffered through

677
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,288
to make me.

678
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,041
That's how all of you look
at your parents.

679
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,292
You don't even want to think
about your mother

680
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,837
kind of drunk on the bed going,
"Come on, hurry up!"

681
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,009
And your father going,
"You're not even wet yet!"

682
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,263
And her going,
"That's my asshole, stupid!"

683
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,476
And he's not hard.
He's got paintbrush dick.

684
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,020
You don't want to think about your father
with paintbrush dick.

685
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,944
Looks like a snail
trying to break into an aquarium.

686
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,535
You don't want to picture your mother
going, "Hold on.

687
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:49,869
Hurry up."

688
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,339
I'll give you all a second
to insert your parents into that thought,

689
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:05,385
like I have to do every time I tell
that fucking stupid joke.

690
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:10,098
But it's so funny how we just don't think
of them that way.

691
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,183
And I grew up in a pretty conservative...

692
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,103
I don't know how I turned
into such a monster

693
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,813
growing up in a conservative house.

694
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,399
Did anybody have
kind of open-minded parents

695
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,526
who would talk to you about sex?
Anybody have parents like that?

696
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,069
- [man] Yes.
- Who said "yes"?

697
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,488
You're nodding. How old were you
when your parents talked to you about sex?

698
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,490
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen?

699
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:30,243
- They broke it to me hard.
- They broke it to you hard?

700
00:39:31,244 --> 00:39:32,495
How'd they break it to you?

701
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,999
They just straight up told me,
"This is how this happens. There you are."

702
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,543
They straight up told you, "This is
how this happens, and there you are."

703
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,463
And when you were 13, you didn't know...

704
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,049
Oh, no, what else did they tell you?

705
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:48,303
"And we're the ones who put the gifts
under the tree."

706
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,351
Did you ever catch them having sex?
Anybody ever catch your parents?

707
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,519
[woman] Oh, I did.

708
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,230
- There's always a couple.
- I did.

709
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:00,982
- Who's the woman who said, "I did"?
- I did.

710
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,066
Hello, miss.

711
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,240
- They talked about it to me...
- Hold on, miss.

712
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:11,326
You're panicking. I feel like...

713
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,369
She's been waiting 30 years
for someone to ask her,

714
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,829
"Did they ever talk to you about it?"

715
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,499
Hold on.

716
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,669
How old were you when you saw them?

717
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,797
[woman] I tried to block it out.

718
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:28,051
Are you trying to block it...
I'm just asking in general. About how old?

719
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,303
[woman] I don't know.
I would assume, like, ten or so.

720
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,430
About ten.
What were you doing at the time?

721
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,682
- Were you in the house?
- Yeah, I had a bad dream.

722
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,351
- I walked into their room.
- You had a bad dream.

723
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,770
Oh, Christ. Then you walked
into a nightmare. That's nice.

724
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,403
That's the last thing you need
after a bad dream.

725
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:49,405
"Oh, I dreamt there was a ghost
under my bed.

726
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,615
Oh, terrific."

727
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:54,994
Now, you walked in.

728
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,746
- Were they in the bedroom?
- Yeah.

729
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,082
- Did they know that you saw them?
- Yeah.

730
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,875
Yes, they did.
Did they talk to you about it after?

731
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,711
It was obvious. No, my dad asked me
if I wanted hot chocolate.

732
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,797
Your dad asked
if you wanted hot chocolate.

733
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:11,052
Oh, no. They were having anal. Oh, no.

734
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,434
Well, that's what you need
after you catch your parents fucking.

735
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:19,978
"Aah!" [popping sound]

736
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,312
"Let's have a cocoa."

737
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,445
Now, okay, so you had hot chocolate,

738
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,489
and they told you about what happened
and what it was?

739
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,410
No. Like, my parents...
I knew what it was when I walked in.

740
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,246
You knew what it was when you walked in.
Some people just don't talk about it.

741
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,957
It's just no eye contact
at the breakfast table until you're 18.

742
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,917
Like, "You want milk for your Cheerios?"

743
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,003
"No, I'll just fucking cut it
with a fork and knife."

744
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,590
I know you kind of don't want
to think about it. I understand.

745
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:50,800
What position...

746
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,470
were they in?

747
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,682
It depends, is this gonna be aired?
Are they gonna know?

748
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:00,601
Is it gonna be aired? No!

749
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,562
No!

750
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,772
No.

751
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,983
No.

752
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,528
Why would we air it on a Netflix special?

753
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,532
Wow. Somebody's not very observant.

754
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,868
What did you think that was?

755
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,246
Did you think that was LeBron James' arm
taking a selfie?

756
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,631
Yeah, so, we don't know who you are,
we don't know who your parents are.

757
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,050
What position?

758
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,307
- Oh, you're really waiting for...
- I'm really waiting. Of course I am.

759
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,143
Please. You think that thing
just jumped up for no reason?

760
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,356
It's not dripping down my leg for nothing,
sweetie.

761
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:53,821
- I don't know. Just, like, regular.
- Regular. Missionary. Okay, cool.

762
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,407
Were Mom's legs wrapped around Dad?

763
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,038
Like, was she trying to keep in that seed?

764
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:06,959
Or were the legs wide open
'cause Dad was drilling that pussy...

765
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,881
so hard that her legs just shot open?

766
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,472
Thank you very much for sharing that
with us.

767
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,733
It's funny, people's reaction
when they catch their parents.

768
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:32,902
I've never caught my parents, thank God,

769
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:35,238
but you kind of know
when they're doing something.

770
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,906
I would always know my parents
were doing something

771
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,533
'cause it'd be in the middle
of the afternoon

772
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,743
and the bedroom door would be closed,

773
00:43:40,827 --> 00:43:42,161
and then you'd just hear, like...

774
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,913
[squeaking]

775
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,206
And then the telltale...

776
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,415
[whirring]

777
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,792
of the Polaroid.

778
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,756
[squeaks, whirs]

779
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,218
And you knew they were almost finished
as it started getting faster.

780
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,803
And then you'd hear, "My eye burns!"

781
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,596
[whirring]

782
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,518
Then your mom
and three of your dad's coworkers

783
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,103
would walk out of the bedroom.

784
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,403
But some people...
Like, we talked, some parents...

785
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,322
some parents are just open-minded,
and they're more liberal about it.

786
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,409
My buddy Scott knew where
his mother's dildo collection was.

787
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,745
And we did not handle that information
responsibly.

788
00:44:26,706 --> 00:44:29,500
As ten-year-old kids,
as soon as his parents left the house,

789
00:44:29,584 --> 00:44:32,295
we would grab the dildos,
start sword-fighting with them.

790
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,424
We'd try to chase him
and shove them in his mouth.

791
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,140
I got one shoved in my mouth.
I had to pretend I didn't like it.

792
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,308
"Cut it out, guys!"

793
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,851
[groaning]

794
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,480
We used to throw them at his cat...

795
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:56,068
which I wouldn't do now,
but in 1979, that was Xbox.

796
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:57,486
That was all we had.

797
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,074
And I wish I had an iPhone back then.
What a great video that would've been,

798
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,076
just a cat under a sofa
with its ears back,

799
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,870
hissing at a pile of dildos.

800
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,622
[hissing]

801
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,793
And his mother must've wondered
why all her dildos

802
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,254
had scratch marks and cat hair on them.

803
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,424
She'd probably grab the cat
and smack his face.

804
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,509
"What were you doing with my dildos?"

805
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,392
I don't know if my mother has dildos
to this day.

806
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,394
I'm in my 40s. I have no idea.

807
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:33,189
When my parents die,
I'm not going through their shit.

808
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:36,859
I'm just going to take the dresser
and kick it into the front yard.

809
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,196
Let the homeless people take
whatever they want.

810
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,865
Maybe I'll look out the window
and see a homeless guy running away

811
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:46,452
with what is hopefully
a small white dildo.

812
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,870
That's all you can hope for.

813
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:52,124
You definitely don't want to see one
of those over-the-shoulder jobs.

814
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:01,092
Bouncing in the front and the back.

815
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,427
With two heads on it. "Oh, Mom."

816
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:06,847
Or "Oh, Mom and Dad. Ohh.

817
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:10,351
Oh, no. Mom and Dad were bookending."

818
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,151
Yeah, they were pretty normal people.

819
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:22,196
And I turned into such a dirtbag
and a dirty guy,

820
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,324
and I just... I don't know.
I was always kind of antisocial.

821
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,742
You ever look back at your life
and realize,

822
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,620
"Wow, I was a fucking antisocial
human being."

823
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,998
When I was 13,
I used to drink with my friends.

824
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,875
I stopped when I was very young,
but for the few years I did it,

825
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:38,212
I was a weirdo. Like, a real weirdo.

826
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,381
We used to get drunk at my friend's house,

827
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,842
and I wouldn't do fun drunk stuff.

828
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,886
I used to get drunk and then just go
into his family's bathroom

829
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,681
and urinate all over the sink handles

830
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:52,935
and, like, on the toothbrushes
and in the soap dish.

831
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,439
And here's the psychotic part.

832
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,191
I wouldn't even tell my other friends
I had done it.

833
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:03,237
When you're that young, no matter what
you do to make your friends laugh is okay.

834
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,365
But I didn't tell my friends.
I just kind of sat there,

835
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:09,368
just smirking
like a fucking serial killer,

836
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,998
just thinking of his family
washing their face with my piss soap.

837
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,125
Like, what a fucking creep.

838
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,674
And I've talked about this before
on the air.

839
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:28,220
The cat... I would always take the cat,
and I would unroll his father's newspaper

840
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:30,973
and scoop all the cat shit out
of the litterbox

841
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:34,518
and put it in the newspaper
and then carefully roll it back up

842
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,855
and put it on the coffee table.

843
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,358
And to this day, I still think
I'm kind of a genius for having done that.

844
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,862
But I never got to see the results of it.

845
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:48,699
Like, if I had a time machine
and I could only use it once,

846
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,911
I wouldn't save Jesus.
I wouldn't stop World War II.

847
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,331
I'd go back to North Brunswick,
New Jersey, in 1979

848
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,209
just to watch that man
open his newspaper

849
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,546
and see his face as animal shit fell
on his lap.

850
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:07,134
You know how many times that cat
probably got beaten with a shoe?

851
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,306
And the cat can't articulate.
"Really? You think I took my own shit

852
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,851
and put it in a newspaper
and rolled it up carefully

853
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:18,896
like I'm fucking hosting a cat prank show,
you dummy?"

854
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,985
You ever have memories come flooding back?
That happens sometimes, too.

855
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,071
I blocked a lot of shit out
when I was young.

856
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,698
And this one is not even traumatic.
It was just weird.

857
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:33,077
I was with my friend,
and we were stealing <i>Star Wars </i>figures.

858
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,079
They were the original
<i>Star Wars </i>figures.

859
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,998
Remember them?
They were, like, four inches tall,

860
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:40,626
and some of them are worth thousands
of dollars today

861
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,128
because they're ultra-rare.

862
00:48:42,211 --> 00:48:44,964
So, it was one of my best friends.
He was a really good dude.

863
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,424
He had a huge dick.
And we're in a department...

864
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,885
I'm saying that for a reason.
I'm not just throwing...

865
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:52,138
That would be great
if I didn't go back to it for any reason.

866
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,765
"Did he elaborate on his friend's dick?"

867
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:56,892
"No, he just threw it out there
and smiled."

868
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,646
He was just the guy
that we all knew had a huge dick.

869
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:04,859
So, we had on shorts and tank tops,
so we couldn't put stuff down our shorts.

870
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,736
So, we were taking the action figures out
of the package

871
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:10,614
and kind of walking up
to the front of the store and hiding them,

872
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:12,533
and at the end of the day,
we were gonna scoop a bunch

873
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,160
and just run out the door.

874
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:17,663
So, security sees us at one point,
takes us downstairs.

875
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,456
And he says,
"What the fuck are you guys doing?!"

876
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,125
We're like, "We didn't do anything."

877
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:25,129
And then he looks at the bulge
in my friend's pants,

878
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,630
and he goes, "What have you got in there?"

879
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,550
Again, I knew my friend had a big dick,
so it didn't surprise me

880
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:32,344
that the security guard thought he had
a couple of Chewbaccas and a Vader.

881
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:33,554
I got it.

882
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:38,017
He looked at my shorts
and knew there were no stolen figures.

883
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,143
Maybe a Yoda.

884
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,105
So, my friend's like,
"I don't have anything."

885
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,232
And the security guard goes, "Let me see."

886
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,651
So, my friend pulls his shorts aside,

887
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:51,822
and this gift of a cock rolls out.

888
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:53,866
Have you ever seen a cock roll out?

889
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,036
It was like watching
time-lapse photography of a flower.

890
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:03,542
It was like watching a cinnamon bun
in reverse, on how it's made.

891
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:08,380
It actually made, like, a little noise.

892
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:11,133
I'm trying to remember the noise it made
when it hit the chair,

893
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:12,468
'cause it was a plastic chair.

894
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,095
Have you heard a ham dropped on linoleum?

895
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,850
And it's a surreal moment in my childhood.

896
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:23,646
We were all just kind of looking
at my friend's big stupid dick.

897
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,899
And then the security guard looks at me,
and he goes, "Wait outside."

898
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,986
Sends me outside. So, I'm outside
the security office 15 minutes.

899
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,490
He comes out, puts his head out the door,
doesn't even open it all the way.

900
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,076
He goes, "All right,
I've decided not to call your mother.

901
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,328
Now get the fuck out of here
and don't come back.

902
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,790
I gotta talk to your friend for a while."
And he closes the door.

903
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:46,669
I walk out that side door.
I wipe it from my memory.

904
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:51,006
Something sparks it this year,
and the whole day comes flooding back,

905
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:55,052
and I'm like, "Oh, no. Oh, you idiot.

906
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,972
You never got the rest
of those <i>Star Wars </i>figures."

907
00:51:02,977 --> 00:51:04,687
Thousands of dollars' worth
of merchandise.

908
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,146
And I never would've got caught

909
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:09,984
'cause the security guard was busy choking
on my friend's giant dick.

910
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,953
So, that's the type of stuff I talk about,
and I wonder why I can't find a gal.

911
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,540
I wouldn't mind a girlfriend
at this point.

912
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:26,500
I really have been single for five years,

913
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,378
and at this point, I don't even know
where to go to meet women.

914
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,714
I sincerely don't.
I don't know what women want.

915
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:34,842
We all think we know.
You know, dressing a certain way.

916
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,094
Obviously, I'm not a great dresser.

917
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,179
Do you like my shoes, by the way?

918
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,639
[cheers and applause]

919
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:43,600
Yeah! Yeah.

920
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,396
I mean, someone told me
these Yeezys are fake.

921
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,898
I don't think they're fake,
'cause if they are,

922
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,817
somebody owes me 20 bucks.

923
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,113
I don't even what women want.
What do women...

924
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,534
I'll ask you as women,
what is it you look for in a guy?

925
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,453
- [woman] Humor.
- Humor. Okay.

926
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,871
I'll address this myth.

927
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,880
I think women think they're supposed
to say "humor."

928
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,466
"I love a funny guy." No, you don't.

929
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,094
No, you don't. 'Cause if you asked me,
"What kind of women do you like?"

930
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:20,554
I'll be like, "Intelligent."

931
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:24,850
It's nice, but it's not number one
on the list.

932
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,602
Believe me,
if you have fat enough nipples,

933
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,438
I don't care if you eat paint chips
for breakfast...

934
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,649
and fucking bang your head
into a screen door

935
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,943
like Rain Man when the toast is burning.

936
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,413
But sense of humor...
Like, I'm a funny guy.

937
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,832
Being a funny guy
has never, ever helped me get laid.

938
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,085
Here's the only time
that being funny has helped me get laid:

939
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,296
When a woman's only other option
is a guy who looks like me

940
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,631
who isn't funny.

941
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:59,259
Then it will kind of get you the nod.
Like, "All right."

942
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:02,304
It's never enthusiastic.
Like, "Oh, my God. You're really..."

943
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,555
[grunting]

944
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,352
It's always a kind of a default.
It's never overcome good looks.

945
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:11,397
No one's ever looked at me and went,
"Ah, I don't know.

946
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:14,483
That guy's six-foot-three.
He's got a great body. He's a triathlete.

947
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,193
But the little fella...

948
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:21,156
his anecdotes will have me in stitches
the entire evening.

949
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,243
Come on, big boy.
Slam your face into my pussy

950
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,328
and do some knock-knock jokes."

951
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,126
And I'm a good guy to date
'cause I'm a dirty guy.

952
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,877
I figure women would like a guy like me.

953
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:37,464
Like, I love giving oral sex
to women more than I like anything.

954
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,925
And I like... I mean, immediately.
I go right down there.

955
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:43,512
And I like things on women
that you don't even like on yourselves.

956
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:46,348
Every special,
I talk about liking a bigger pussy.

957
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:49,560
I like an untraditional vagina.

958
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,478
A cock. No, I'm kidding.

959
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:00,654
I like the type of vagina
that a woman is self-conscious about.

960
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:04,283
You remember in high school, if you had
to keep your crotch in the locker

961
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:06,368
'cause all the other girls were cruel
and they'd walk by...

962
00:54:06,452 --> 00:54:09,204
"Hey, it's Big Pussy McGillicuddy"
or whatever they'd say.

963
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,627
And I've learned a lot about what's sexy
and what's not sexy.

964
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,880
Don't talk when you're going down
on a woman.

965
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,591
There's nothing sexy you're gonna say
when you're giving her head.

966
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,469
If a girl's going down on you and she's
like, "I love sucking your cock,"

967
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:25,012
that's kind of sexy to hear.

968
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:28,098
But there's nothing you're gonna say
when you're going down on a woman

969
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:30,601
that's gonna make her happier
than what you're doing.

970
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:32,978
I had a girl tell me that one time
her boyfriend was eating her pussy,

971
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:37,399
and he stopped, and he looked up
and he went, "Mmm. You taste scrumptious."

972
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,488
It's actually sexier
when you're eating pussy

973
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:45,157
if you look up and go,
"ISIS beheads people."

974
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:59,922
One thing I hate: I hate using my fingers.
That's the only thing I don't like,

975
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:01,673
when a girl's like,
"Put your fingers in me."

976
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:03,634
'Cause I have little hands,

977
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:09,181
and every time I put my fingers in,
I never quite get to where...

978
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,601
I just barely can touch the bottom
of the G-spot.

979
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,645
And they're always like,
"A little deeper."

980
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,980
"But the webbing."

981
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,317
[groaning]

982
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,194
I gotta take my left arm
and push the right one.

983
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,529
[groaning]

984
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:28,367
And one of my closest friends
was Patrice O'Neal.

985
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,701
You know Patrice.

986
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,203
[cheers and applause]

987
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,751
And it's funny. Patrice would annoy me,

988
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,712
'cause he would always brag
about how great he was at finger-popping.

989
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:45,008
But Patrice would always brag
about finger-popping,

990
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:49,096
and I watched him one time in Brazil
make a girl squirt using his fingers.

991
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:52,140
'Cause Patrice had fingers
like ballerina legs.

992
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:56,144
I was in one bed with my girl.
He was in one with his.

993
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:58,855
And he was like, whap, whap, whap,

994
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,023
and she would squirt.

995
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,400
[squirting sound]

996
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,652
And then my girl is squirting,
but out of her eyes,

997
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,903
watching the other...

998
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:10,909
And I'm doing the best I can,
but I just couldn't...

999
00:56:10,993 --> 00:56:15,163
My fingers were like two polio legs
in a swimming pool.

1000
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:19,876
The girl finally got annoyed
and just pushed my hand out.

1001
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,129
"All right, Peter Dinklage fingers.
Fucking..."

1002
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,014
I really don't know where
to meet the women.

1003
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,516
After that bit,
I don't expect to meet a lot of you.

1004
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,021
I'm on the social media apps.
I use Tinder. Anybody else use Tinder?

1005
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,731
[woman] Whoo!

1006
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,941
The woman who said "whoo,"
how long did it take you to meet somebody?

1007
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,277
- Just yell out the number.
- I'm married.

1008
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,903
You're married. Oh, good.

1009
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,909
So, your parents fucked missionary,
you're married.

1010
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,078
Great. I'm ruining a lot of lives tonight.

1011
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,750
Now, was this before your husband,
or is this how you met him?

1012
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,418
[nervously] After.

1013
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,629
[crowd] Whoa!

1014
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,173
After. Hmm.

1015
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,884
I fucking love that.

1016
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,013
"Who are you talking to?"
"It's a buddy, see? Ahh."

1017
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:21,355
I am on Tinder.
And I'm sure most of you know what it is.

1018
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,732
You upload photos,
you swipe "like" or "nope,"

1019
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,777
and if you have a match,
you can talk to that person.

1020
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,571
And before you do it, you have to set
the parameters you want to search,

1021
00:57:29,655 --> 00:57:30,656
the distance.

1022
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:35,035
I live here in New York, in Midtown,
so I set it to search a three-mile radius.

1023
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,912
And you gotta set the age range.

1024
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:39,373
I'm in my 40s, so I set it for 18.

1025
00:57:40,832 --> 00:57:42,918
That's as far left as it would go.
Heh heh heh.

1026
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:49,091
I actually called Tinder to complain.

1027
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,594
"There's something wrong with your app,
goddamn it. It keeps getting stuck on 18.

1028
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:57,349
Oh, legal stuff. No, I'm just getting...
Norton, yeah."

1029
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,354
It's very addicting. We always say,
"Oh, there's nobody single,"

1030
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,022
but you realize
when you get on an app like that,

1031
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,024
there are so many beautiful single women.

1032
00:58:06,108 --> 00:58:08,944
I was swiping for hours. Like, like, like.

1033
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,530
I didn't swipe "nope" on any...
I didn't give a shit what you looked like.

1034
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,157
A little, teeny Zika virus.
Fuck it. Like.

1035
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,410
Shotgun wound to the face.

1036
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,621
Fuck it. I'll play with her nipples
till the ambulance gets there. Like.

1037
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,208
I heard somebody groan at that.
It's okay to laugh.

1038
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,710
It's not a real scenario.

1039
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,796
You think that really happened?

1040
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,756
A woman got shot in the face
with a shotgun

1041
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,676
and had the wherewithal to snap a selfie?

1042
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,723
And then I happened to go,
"Hey, what are you up to?"

1043
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,267
"Bleeding to death in the hallway."

1044
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,520
"Well, how about I tweak those nips
till help arrives?"

1045
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,361
But I was on for three days,
swiping for hours,

1046
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,071
getting no responses,

1047
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,115
and that's a gut-punch
to your self-esteem.

1048
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,034
I'm like,
"I'm a worthless piece of shit."

1049
00:58:57,117 --> 00:58:59,911
But then I'm like, "No, maybe I just
didn't put broad enough options."

1050
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:01,705
I only set it for three square miles.

1051
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,375
Midtown New York...
what is that, 1.8 million people?

1052
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:14,342
So, I kind of opened up my search options.
Maximum age, maximum distance.

1053
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:17,804
I pretty much set it for,
if you have a pussy in North America,

1054
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,723
or hope to someday...

1055
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,897
I finally got a Tinder match,

1056
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:31,193
and I'm actually going to read
the interaction to you.

1057
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,447
I was talking to this girl.
It was going really, really well.

1058
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,950
Talking to her for five days,
back and forth, every day.

1059
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,452
"Hey, good morning. How are you?"

1060
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:44,164
On the fifth day, I finally said to her,
"I'm really enjoying speaking to you.

1061
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,666
I'd love to talk on the phone.
Can I have your number?"

1062
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:51,713
Nothing. No response.
Absolutely ghosted me.

1063
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:55,759
So, four days later, I write back,
"I guess that's a no. LOL."

1064
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,927
You know.

1065
00:59:57,969 --> 01:00:01,723
Laughing out loud,
just to keep it good-natured and fun.

1066
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:03,391
She responds,

1067
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:06,228
"To be perfectly honest,
I googled you."

1068
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,357
I don't know what your lives are like,

that's the last thing you want to read.

"I googled you."

1071
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:19,741
"Cosby Hitler" has better Google results
than "Jim Norton."

1072
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:24,913
"I googled you and was watching
a video of you talking

1073
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,958
about sending photos of your penis
to a girl.

1074
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,044
I didn't know if it was a good idea
to give you my number.

1075
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,755
So sorry. Just trying to be honest."

I felt awful. I had no idea what to write.

1078
01:00:39,511 --> 01:00:42,389
I just wrote back, "Cunt.

1079
