1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,008
[cheering and applause]

2
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,519
[cheering and applause ends]

3
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,522
Now...

4
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,732
[laughter]

5
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,694
my best friend's wife
is a born again Christian,

6
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,864
and we do not get along at all.

7
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,032
[laughter]

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,284
The other day, she called me up
to yell at me,

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,746
saying I'm a terrible influence
on her husband

10
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,582
because he called her a bad name.

11
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,500
I said, "What?

12
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,211
Did he call you a bitch?"

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,796
[laughter]

14
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,506
She said, "No, Anthony.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,176
He did not use the B word."

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,927
[laughter]

17
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,596
I said, "Uh-oh."

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,223
[laughter]

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,399
"Did he call you a cunt?"

20
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,526
[laughter]

21
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:14,574
She said, "No." I said,
"Well, then he didn't hear it from me."

22
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:19,746
[laughter and applause]

23
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:37,013
Yeah, that's pretty much
the greatest opening joke of all time.

24
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,099
[laughter]

25
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,352
Because even if
you've never heard of me before,

26
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,646
which I doubt...

27
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,731
[laughter]

28
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,402
you listen to that first joke,
you're like, "Oh I get it.

29
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,488
[laughter]

30
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,031
He's fucking brilliant."

31
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,117
[laughter]

32
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,042
My sister just had a baby.

33
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:11,172
My sister had a baby
to try to save the relationship.

34
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,258
[hisses]

35
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,593
But I still don't talk to her.

36
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,762
[laughter]

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,114
Guys, this is gonna take forever.

38
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,825
-Um...
-[laughter]

39
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:49,169
Life can be funny sometimes, all right?
Like, I can't get into details right now.

40
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:52,088
But earlier this week,

41
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:57,093
I received the single greatest phone call
of my life.

42
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,888
And then just five minutes later,

43
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,015
I got another call

44
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,726
telling me that my dad is in the hospital.

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,563
I said, "Yeah, I just heard."

46
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,608
[laughter]

47
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:29,292
I mean, look, I don't want to give
you guys the wrong impression, you know.

48
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,003
I didn't hate my father.

49
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,631
My father wasn't a bad guy.

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,550
For instance, I never once,

51
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,969
not once, not ever, ever

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,805
saw my dad hit my mother.

53
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,144
I mean, he was quick and you can't...

54
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,980
[laughter]

55
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:58,071
you can't teach speed.
That comes from here.

56
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,156
[laughter]

57
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,998
I remember when I was 13,

58
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,627
my mom got diagnosed with Parkinson's 

59
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,004
and my dad just gave up immediately.

60
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,549
Said, "I can't deal with this,
I can't live like this,"

61
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,968
and packed up his car.

62
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,012
So, as a 13-year-old boy,

63
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,225
I had to be the one to roll up my sleeves
and say, "Okay.

64
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,937
Guess I'm going with Dad.

65
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,564
[laughter]

66
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,786
Sounds like Mom needs some alone time."

67
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,871
[laughter]

68
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,587
I think, like a lot of guys....

69
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,674
I'll never forget

70
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,136
the one time I saw my dad's penis.

71
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,221
[laughter]

72
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:07,265
I said, "Dad,

73
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,852
don't text me shit like that."

74
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,688
[laughter and applause]

75
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,959
When I was a kid,
my family used to move around a lot.

76
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,461
[clears throat]

77
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,088
But now they're all fat as fuck.

78
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,174
[laughter]

79
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:47,972
To give you an idea...

80
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:53,478
To give you all an idea
of how crazy my family is,

81
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,607
I'm not even the biggest asshole
in my own family.

82
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,192
[laughter]

83
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,736
I have this cousin.

84
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:07,241
Everybody hated this cousin,
my own family hated this cousin.

85
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,702
And then a couple of years ago,

86
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,455
my cousin fell off of a horse

87
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,248
and broke his neck.

88
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:19,003
We all refer to that
as "the Superman incident."

89
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,465
[laughter]

90
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,684
Because that horse is a hero.

91
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,686
[laughter and applause]

92
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,994
When I was in high school,
my high school employed a blind janitor.

93
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,082
One hundred percent totally blind.

94
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,293
And all the other kids would joke around

95
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,839
that he went blind
from masturbating too much.

96
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,465
[laughter]

97
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,300
And at the time, I believed that.

98
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,845
I was just a kid,
I didn't know any better.

99
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:14,976
It wasn't until I got older, wiser,
I realized that's just an old wives' tale

100
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,394
they used to use to...

101
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:21,274
try to explain why
he was always masturbating.

102
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,775
[laughter]

103
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:42,545
One of my good friends is a narcoleptic.

104
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,799
A narcoleptic. It's the craziest shit.

105
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:52,305
One minute, we're having a conversation,
like, everything is completely normal.

106
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,932
And then the next thing I know,

107
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,851
I'm having sex.

108
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,146
-It's...
-[laughter]

109
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,164
Did everybody get that one?

110
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,249
[laughter]

111
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,336
[cheering and applause]

112
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,091
If you didn't get that last joke,
don't worry.

113
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,678
This next joke is just like it.

114
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,306
Only dumb.

115
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,850
[laughter]

116
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,732
One of my old friends from high school
now works as a doctor

117
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,359
in the emergency room.

118
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:51,072
He once told me that 25% of his job

119
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:55,368
is pulling strange objects
out of people's asses.

120
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,288
We don't talk much anymore.

121
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,374
[laughter]

122
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,383
But I see him all the time.

123
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,468
[laughter]

124
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,602
If you didn't get either joke,
how did you figure out Netflix?

125
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,688
[laughter]

126
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,861
I live in Los Angeles.

127
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,614
Like you fucking wish you could.

128
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,700
[laughter]

129
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,827
[male audience member] Yeah!

130
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,747
I like my place.

131
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,333
I'm not that crazy about my neighbors.

132
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,919
Like, I live on the same street

133
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,674
as three different families
of Jehovah's Witnesses.

134
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:57,013
And no matter how many times
I tell them, "No, absolutely not,"

135
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,599
they still come by twice a week

136
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,225
and say, "Anthony,

137
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,812
please stop throwing rocks at our houses."

138
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,897
[laughter]

139
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,408
"Don't push your religion on me."

140
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,577
[laughter]

141
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,207
And they're not even the worst
of my neighbors.

142
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,920
One of my next-door neighbors
is a 90-year-old man

143
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,173
suffering from Alzheimer's.

144
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,136
And every single morning at 9 a.m.

145
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,767
he knocks on my door, and he asks me
if I have seen his wife.

146
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:44,977
Which means...

147
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,981
that every single morning at 9 a.m.

148
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:54,320
I have to explain to a 90-year-old man
suffering from Alzheimer's

149
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:58,658
that his wife has been dead
for quite some time.

150
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,327
Now, I have thought about moving.

151
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,040
I have thought about just not answering
my door in the morning,

152
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,667
but to be honest,

153
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,585
it's worth it

154
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,880
just to see the smile on his face.

155
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,426
[laughter and applause]

156
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,400
Yeah, for some reason,
that joke's a crowd-pleaser.

157
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:33,359
[laughter]

158
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:42,201
My grandmother is suffering
from dementia right now.

159
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,162
She forgets who she is,

160
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,332
wanders out of the house
and gets lost for hours.

161
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,667
It's a problem.

162
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,502
So what I did...

163
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,505
is I tied a bell around her neck.

164
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,551
Sounds inhumane, sure.

165
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,344
But problem solved.

166
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,971
[laughter]

167
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,764
I mean, that thing is...

168
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,391
really heavy.

169
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,476
[laughter]

170
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,568
If you're not laughing right now...

171
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,653
[laughter]

172
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,115
...the problem is your imagination.

173
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,325
[laughter]

174
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,581
Don't get mad at me 'cause you don't know
how big bells can get.

175
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,666
[laughter]

176
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,093
I remember, like, a couple weeks
after my grandfather died,

177
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,264
my father discovered a giant trove

178
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,600
of vintage pornography.

179
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,728
Frankly, an embarrassing amount

180
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,189
of vintage pornography.

181
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,567
So I blamed it on Grandpa.

182
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,445
[laughter]

183
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,166
My grandfather died a couple of years ago.

184
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,876
But he died like a king.

185
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,669
No one was even mad.

186
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,424
My grandfather died in what has to be
the best way possible.

187
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:26,680
My grandfather died in a hammock,
on a beach in Hawaii

188
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,390
during a sunset.

189
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,851
That's how I want to go out.

190
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,771
Strangled to death.

191
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,731
[laughter]

192
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,191
It just seems like fun.

193
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,276
[laughter]

194
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,112
You know, sometimes...

195
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,741
Sometimes I wonder
if I could kill someone.

196
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,454
Like, do I have it in me
to take a human life?

197
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,414
And then I remember...

198
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,626
Oh, yeah, Debbie.

199
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,711
[laughter]

200
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,713
How do you...

201
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,799
[laughter]

202
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,263
How do you forget Debbie?

203
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,348
[laughter]

204
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,642
She was special.

205
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,727
[laughter]

206
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,275
Speaking of special,

207
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:23,070
went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago,

208
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,072
found that I'm special.

209
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,782
[laughter]

210
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,034
Went to the doctor, took a blood test.

211
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,828
My results came back.

212
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,581
Doctor told me my blood type

213
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,083
is O-negative.

214
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,586
You know what that means?

215
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,255
Means I'm the fucking best.

216
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,173
[laughter]

217
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,134
Means I'm a universal donor.

218
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,972
Means I can give my blood
to anyone else in the world

219
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,266
who also has AIDS.

220
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,977
[laughter and applause]

221
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,192
Uh-huh.

222
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,787
I am not afraid to say this,

223
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,498
I hate pretty much

224
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,252
every single religion in the world.

225
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,339
-[scattered cheers]
-Let me repeat that.

226
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,799
[applause]

227
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,968
I hate pretty much

228
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,971
every single religion in the world.

229
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,806
Did you know there's a religion

230
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,559
called Christian Science,

231
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,937
where they believe

232
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,857
that even if their own children
are sick and dying

233
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,694
and all they need to save their lives
is a little bit of medicine,

234
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:50,491
their beliefs won't let them
give their own children that medicine.

235
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,203
That's the only good religion.

236
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,163
[laughter]

237
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,633
I was like, "Get me a cup
that I can put toothbrushes in."

238
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,718
[laughter]

239
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,940
All right, guys, listen,

240
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,317
jokes are all well and good.

241
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:29,363
I'd like to take a couple of minutes
right now and talk about something

242
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,823
that is important to me.

243
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:35,285
And I will preface this by saying
there's a lot of people right now

244
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,789
who say that stand-up comedians
should just stick to comedy,

245
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,083
and not talk about anything else.

246
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,501
I disagree.

247
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,422
I think that stand-up comedy
doesn't always have to be funny.

248
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,092
Stand-up comedy doesn't
always have to be entertaining.

249
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,512
Sometimes, it's about
speaking truth to power.

250
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,055
Sometimes,

251
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,433
it's about pointing out wrongs
in the world,

252
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,810
even though it might not be popular.

253
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,145
So please,

254
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:02,938
indulge me.

255
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:07,317
With all the terrible things
going on in America right now,

256
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,279
and you know exactly what
I'm fucking talking about...

257
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,364
[laughter]

258
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,659
With all the terrible things going on
in this country right now,

259
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,995
the thing that drives me the most crazy

260
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,290
are the people who see
all this awful stuff happening,

261
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,668
and they still flip out
over the little things.

262
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,588
My biggest pet peeve in America today

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,549
are people will see
all this horrible stuff going on

264
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:35,679
and yet they still overreact
to shit that just does not matter.

265
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,474
For example...

266
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,771
have you ever dropped a baby?

267
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,981
[laughter]

268
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,494
Holy shit, do people overreact!

269
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,579
[laughter]

270
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,126
You drop a baby in America today,

271
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,256
I swear people hit the roof
before the baby even touches the floor.

272
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,342
[laughter]

273
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,971
And it's not a big deal.

274
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,682
How do I know?

275
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,145
Because I do it all the time.

276
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,231
[laughter]

277
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,691
In fact,

278
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,319
I don't think I've ever held a baby...

279
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,489
to completion.

280
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,783
[laughter]

281
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,959
And you might be thinking, "Anthony,

282
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,128
how could you drop a baby?"

283
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,047
You ever held a baby?

284
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,549
[laughter]

285
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,926
How could you not?

286
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,011
[laughter]

287
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:02,724
It's so easy.

288
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,852
[laughter]

289
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,146
It's a two-step process.

290
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,730
[laughter]

291
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,857
Maybe less.

292
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:11,775
[laughter]

293
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,485
Should you ask, "Anthony,

294
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,488
why would anyone
ever let you hold their baby?"

295
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,782
The answer is simple.

296
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,243
Negligence.

297
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,328
[laughter]

298
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,371
I love it.

299
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:25,873
It's a hobby.

300
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,750
The only negative,

301
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,670
the only drawback,
as far as I'm concerned:

302
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,297
the embarrassment.

303
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,676
People try to shame you
when you drop their baby...

304
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,636
[laughter]

305
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,724
...even though I almost always
make it look like an accident.

306
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,809
[laughter]

307
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,567
That's why this is so great.
You ever do this?

308
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,944
You ever drop a baby...

309
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,992
and then scoop it right back up
before anybody sees you?

310
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,787
[laughter]

311
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,291
No shit,

312
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:12,544
-best feeling in the world.
-[laughter]

313
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,717
You just hand the baby back
and no one is the wiser.

314
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,260
[laughter]

315
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,678
Especially...

316
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,472
not that baby.

317
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,557
[laughter]

318
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,731
Happened to me just last weekend.

319
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,651
I was at a party.

320
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,738
One of my friends come up and said,
"Anthony, I got to go to the bathroom.

321
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:41,990
Will you hold my baby?"

322
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,659
[laughter]

323
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,202
And I tell the truth.

324
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,496
I'm always a hundred percent honest.

325
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,206
I say, "Yeah...

326
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,708
for a little bit."

327
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,794
[laughter]

328
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,221
Held that baby 30, 45 seconds,
a personal best.

329
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,682
[laughter]

330
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,684
Dropped the baby.

331
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,769
[laughter]

332
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,647
Scooped it right back up
before anybody saw me.

333
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,400
And it was close too.

334
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,485
[laughter]

335
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:21,154
Had to run down three flights of stairs.

336
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,115
[laughter]

337
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,200
[applause and laughter]

338
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,254
[chuckles]

339
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,844
I'll be honest, I don't really understand

340
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,221
how the legal system works
in this country.

341
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,472
[laughter]

342
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,932
I think it's unfair,

343
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,184
needlessly confusing.

344
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,186
I'll give you an example.

345
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,984
One of my next-door neighbor's kids
is climbing a tree on their property.

346
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,570
Falls out of the tree

347
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,406
and lands on my fence.

348
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,827
Now I'm being told
I've got to get myself a lawyer...

349
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,372
if I want to keep my half of the kid.

350
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,875
[laughter]

351
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,638
How is that fair?

352
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,807
[laughter]

353
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,061
And who's going to reimburse my taxidermy?

354
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,439
[laughter]

355
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,194
[chuckles]

356
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,450
I have a two-year-old nephew.

357
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:50,786
Two years old,

358
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,083
already been to the hospital 27 times

359
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,002
for eating pennies off the floor.

360
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,670
[laughter]

361
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,506
What the fuck?

362
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,591
[laughter]

363
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,095
Honestly...

364
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,598
it's like I can't drop enough pennies.

365
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,683
[laughter]

366
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,861
I'm gonna blow your minds right now.

367
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,821
[laughter]

368
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,032
I'm gonna blow your minds
out the back of your heads. You ready?

369
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,869
I don't like kids.

370
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,955
[laughter]

371
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,584
There's this nine-year-old girl.

372
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,587
Tiny little nine-year-old girl.

373
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,800
Tiny little nine-year-old girl
lives in my neighborhood...

374
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,219
with a glass eye.

375
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,849
Scares the shit out of me.

376
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,475
[laughter]

377
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,811
Terrifies me to my very core.

378
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,480
Anytime she sees me,

379
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,275
she just fucking chases me around.

380
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,360
[laughter]

381
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,572
Until she gets her eye back.
It is the worst...

382
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,657
[laughter]

383
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:22,210
Now, that's a fun joke for you guys,
I'll explain why.

384
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,129
[laughter]

385
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,006
It's got incredible value.

386
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:26,965
[laughter]

387
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,384
It's two laughs for the price of one.

388
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,552
[laughter]

389
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,554
You get to laugh at what I said,

390
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,681
which was hilarious.

391
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,141
[laughter]

392
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,352
And then you get a second laugh
when you picture me...

393
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,604
[laughter]

394
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,106
...stealing a child's glass eye.

395
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,192
[laughter]

396
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,778
And most people when they picture it,

397
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,157
they see me just running up
and snatching it out of her head

398
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,241
and running away.

399
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,201
[laughter]

400
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:55,785
Wrong.

401
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,871
[laughter]

402
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,374
You don't want to just snatch out
somebody's glass eye.

403
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,126
You know why?

404
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,005
Because if you guess wrong...

405
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,966
[laughter]

406
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,936
You guess wrong, now it's not just
a funny prank anymore.

407
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,521
Now you're in some trouble.

408
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,647
[laughter]

409
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,940
In fact,

410
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,277
that's how she lost the eye
in the first place.

411
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,363
[laughter]

412
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,741
What you want to do,

413
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:37,869
if you're ever in this situation...

414
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,204
[laughter]

415
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:43,166
...hit her on the back of the head,
not hard.

416
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,501
[laughter]

417
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:47,837
It's a child, you don't want to hurt it.

418
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,589
[laughter]

419
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,007
Just hard enough to...

420
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:53,969
get that sweet glass eye.

421
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,054
[laughter]

422
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:06,189
I find that the older that I get,
the more women get upset 

423
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:07,774
when you talk about kids.

424
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,943
I don't mean joke about kids,

425
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,155
I mean they get upset when the subject
of children is brought up.

426
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:19,452
Like, I have a friend who just found out
she can't have kids...

427
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,872
according to Child Protective Services.

428
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,958
[laughter]

429
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,757
Hey, did you guys know...

430
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,843
[laughter]

431
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:39,889
Did you guys know
the average person eats nine spiders

432
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,100
whenever I cook for them?

433
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,185
[laughter]

434
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:59,618
I don't know if you guys know
what a false premise is, but...

435
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,287
I have this cat.

436
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,623
[laughter]

437
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,422
I think it must have been a stray cat
because anytime it gets outside,

438
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,508
it immediately runs off, kills something,

439
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,803
drags it back in,
and leaves it at my feet.

440
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,599
I've had this thing for, like, a month
and I swear we have got...

441
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,477
quite the competition going.

442
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,562
[laughter]

443
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,198
I don't even like cats,
if I'm being honest.

444
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,076
More a dog guy, me.

445
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,203
I used to have a Great Dane.

446
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,954
You guys know what a Great Dane is?

447
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,999
One of those big, tall, skinny dogs.

448
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,211
Marmaduke was a Great Dane, Scooby-Doo.

449
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,005
They call them the "heartbreaker breed,"

450
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,509
because they normally only live
up to eight years,

451
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,304
but with the right diet,
exercise, attention...

452
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,182
I got it down to four.

453
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,267
[laughter]

454
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,187
It was great.

455
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,272
It was the perfect college dog,

456
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:12,982
it really was.

457
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,068
[laughter]

458
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,869
Oh, you think I can't tell
one more animal joke? Well, fuck you.

459
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,955
[laughter]

460
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:29,916
Listen to this...

461
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,001
[laughter]

462
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,878
When I was a little kid,

463
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,588
I had a pet turtle.

464
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,051
Tiny little turtle,
kept him in an aquarium.

465
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,554
Then one summer, I went away to camp.

466
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,932
While I was gone at camp, the turtle died.

467
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,768
When I got home, my dad lied to me.

468
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,397
He said, "Anthony, your turtle is alive
and well.

469
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,191
It just went to go live with your mother."

470
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,447
And I believed that.

471
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,201
Till a couple of days later,
I was digging around in the backyard...

472
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,204
found my mom's body.

473
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,290
[laughter]

474
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,676
Worst day of my life. I loved that turtle.

475
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,179
[laughter]

476
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:32,604
Now, listen. Look, guys.
I know, I know, I am aware

477
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:36,691
that I must seem like a tough,
cold son of a bitch up here.

478
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,068
In fact,

479
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:44,115
the only time I've ever cried in public
in my entire life

480
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,659
was at my mom's funeral.

481
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,747
I might be a tough, cold son of a bitch,

482
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,583
but that doesn't mean I'm not also...

483
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,794
one hell of an actor.

484
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,879
[laughter]

485
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,385
My mom was a depressed woman.

486
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,180
My mom was a very depressed woman.

487
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,766
My mom was so depressed,

488
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:16,815
she had the words "in case of an accident,
please do not resuscitate" tattooed...

489
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,110
across all of her children.

490
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,155
[laughter]

491
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:37,502
I'd say my mom's funeral was like ten,
eleven years ago now.

492
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,420
Last year,

493
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,589
I had her body dug up...

494
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:46,344
to settle a legal dispute
with my siblings.

495
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:48,805
Turns out I was wrong.

496
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:51,766
That is illegal.

497
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,810
-[laughter]
-You can't just...

498
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,313
You can't just do that. No.

499
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,655
Now, at this point, I should admit

500
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,867
my parents were actually
pretty reasonable people 

501
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,159
when they were raising me.

502
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,496
Unless they found drugs in my bedroom.

503
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,789
Oof...

504
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,876
Then they were high for days.

505
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,961
[laughter]

506
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,883
I think the strangest thing in my family,

507
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:30,096
my family was just weird about sex,
you know. I was the oldest of five kids

508
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,806
in a tiny little house.

509
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,142
When my parents wanted alone time,

510
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:38,062
they would gather us together, say,
"Kids, go play hide and seek,"

511
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,857
and they'd lock their bedroom door
for an hour.

512
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:44,652
Of course, I always knew
what was going on in there. I mean...

513
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,113
I would hide in their room.

514
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,198
[laughter]

515
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,249
My parents were weird about sex,
you know.

516
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,836
I think the most embarrassed
I've ever been in my entire life

517
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,505
was the time my mom
and dad caught me

518
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,967
watching hardcore bondage pornography...

519
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,887
over their shoulder.

520
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:13,473
[laughter]

521
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:24,400
And I'll never forget...

522
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:28,154
I'll never forget
the first time I had sex.

523
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,573
You know those stories you hear,

524
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:35,370
about kids who lose their virginity
to the hot babysitter?

525
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,706
I was the babysitter.

526
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,001
[laughter]

527
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,426
[cheering and applause]

528
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,184
Yeah, I could have opened with that
if I wanted to.

529
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,686
[laughter]

530
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,150
I don't like racism.

531
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:08,987
Thank you.

532
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,072
[laughter]

533
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,703
I don't get it.

534
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,080
Why would you hate?

535
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,708
Why would you choose to hate?

536
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:26,379
Why would you choose to hate
an entire group of people,

537
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,009
just because of the way they all behave?

538
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,345
[laughter]

539
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,650
I don't know about y'all.

540
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,609
[laughter]

541
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,862
Seems pretty narrow-minded to me.

542
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,530
[laughter]

543
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,785
Now, racism, of course, is...

544
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,330
starting to become a problem
in this country.

545
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:05,126
[laughter]

546
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,758
I was doing some research.

547
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,846
Found out one of my family members
used to own slaves.

548
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,140
I couldn't believe it.

549
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,434
My own brother.

550
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,604
[laughter]

551
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,740
I did even more research.

552
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,868
Went even deeper into this bit,
found this out.

553
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,329
[laughter]

554
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,580
This is a fact.

555
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,795
Do you guys know there are actually
more slaves in the world today

556
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,172
than at any other point in time?

557
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,384
A higher number of slaves
in the world right now

558
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,346
than any other period in history.

559
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,390
You think your job is bad? [scoffs]

560
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,018
Imagine...

561
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,270
counting slaves.

562
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,106
[laughter]

563
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,692
If you're not laughing at this one,
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

564
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,029
[laughter and applause]

565
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,700
I'm not trying that joke out,
I am showing off.

566
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,578
[laughter]

567
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,879
Now, I, of course, do not consider myself
to be a racist person,

568
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:33,506
but I get mad

569
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,135
when people tell me
that I can't understand racism.

570
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,847
I understand racism just fine.

571
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,684
I once got beaten up
by a pack of skinheads.

572
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,853
Beat the shit out of me.

573
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,272
I was in the hospital for a week,

574
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:50,857
and it was a...

575
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:53,192
a brutal initiation.

576
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,279
[laughter]

577
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:59,073
[applause and laughter]

578
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,708
Now,

579
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,626
we like to have fun.

580
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,211
[laughter]

581
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,923
But in all seriousness,
you do have to be very careful

582
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,093
telling ironically racist jokes

583
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,679
once you get to my level.

584
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,058
When you're a bad comedian,
you can say whatever you want.

585
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,685
I mean, that's true freedom.

586
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,354
You've seen those losers, they can fly.

587
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,441
[laughter]

588
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,236
Once you get to my level,

589
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,281
now you've got a responsibility, you know?

590
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:44,744
Like, I once told
an ironically racist joke on television.

591
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:49,540
The next day, I got a fan letter
from a white supremacist

592
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,417
in Jacksonville, Florida.

593
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,669
Bone-chilling.

594
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,880
He just started praising me.

595
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,382
"Thank you so much, Anthony.

596
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:02,011
Thank you for not denigrating
the great white race.

597
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,348
Thank you for making fun
of all the other races

598
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,891
the way that it should be.

599
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:11,604
And can I pay you $100,000,

600
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:15,775
come down to Jacksonville, Florida,
do a private show just for me

601
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,527
and my white supremacist buddies."

602
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,447
I wrote him back right away.

603
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,574
[laughter]

604
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,660
And I said, "Absolutely not.

605
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,664
You are against every single thing
that I stand for,

606
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,749
you cheap piece of shit."

607
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:35,628
[laughter and applause]

608
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,388
Look, I mean, I consider myself
to be a modern man.

609
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,350
I try to be tolerant
of all different races,

610
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,394
cultures, religions.

611
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,983
Not so much religions,
but the other two for sure.

612
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,401
[laughter]

613
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,070
But I'm not always at my best.

614
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,447
Sometimes I make mistakes.

615
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,491
For example,

616
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,327
every single day...

617
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,496
[laughter]

618
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:16,627
Every single day in Los Angeles,
my Latino neighbor tries to talk to me.

619
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,171
I don't understand shit.

620
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,339
[laughter]

621
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,092
Nine times out of ten, I am polite.

622
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,469
I smile and I nod,

623
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,305
but the other day,

624
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,557
the other day, I was tired,

625
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,350
I was hungover,

626
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,311
I'd smoked some pot,

627
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,439
I'd taken a handful of pills...

628
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,316
[laughter]

629
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:40,526
...and I was not at my best.

630
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,279
And I just snapped.

631
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,656
And I said, "Hey, asshole.

632
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,075
This is America.

633
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,537
I don't speak sign language."

634
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,206
[laughter]

635
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,170
[laughter and applause]

636
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,133
Now, that...

637
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,344
that...

638
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,596
is a fun joke from me.

639
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,181
[laughter]

640
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,475
You think
I'm about to make fun of Latinos,

641
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,352
I take a hard left.

642
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,145
[laughter]

643
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,606
Smack the shit out of the deaf...

644
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,691
[laughter]

645
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,366
...for almost no reason.

646
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,993
[laughter]

647
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,916
Guys, things like that just make me happy.

648
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,292
[laughter]

649
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,835
There's not a lot in life

650
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,254
that always makes me happy.

651
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:45,299
One thing,

652
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,302
one thing that always makes me happy.

653
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,222
I love it when I see this.

654
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,557
I love it when old married couples...

655
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,645
I love it when old married couples die

656
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,980
really close together.

657
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,066
[laughter]

658
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:03,818
I love that.

659
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,903
[laughter]

660
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,407
I will clip that out of the newspaper
every time I see it.

661
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,158
[laughter]

662
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,786
To me, there is just nothing more romantic

663
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,581
than a good old-fashioned murder-suicide.

664
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,376
[laughter]

665
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,293
True.

666
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,088
[applause and laughter]

667
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,424
In fact...

668
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,137
now that I'm saying this out loud,

669
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,057
it's probably more accurate

670
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,102
just to say that I love murder-suicide.

671
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,979
[laughter]

672
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,357
Because I do.

673
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,733
[laughter]

674
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:49,238
I mean, don't get me wrong, guys,
I like all of the suicides.

675
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,323
[laughter]

676
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,872
But murder-suicide's my favorite.

677
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,957
[laughter]

678
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,376
I have friends who worry about me.

679
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,044
[laughter]

680
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,130
They'll say, "Anthony,
why are you so into suicide?

681
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,506
You have everything."

682
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:08,924
Yeah.

683
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:12,470
Everything but
a successful suicide attempt.

684
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,555
[laughter]

685
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,643
I think I got really into suicide
just after college,

686
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,772
when I worked at a suicide hotline.

687
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,858
[laughter and groans]

688
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,029
Just for a couple of days.

689
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,865
[laughter]

690
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,994
Day and a half, really,
they got rid of me pretty quick.

691
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,079
[laughter]

692
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,541
They said,
"Anthony, we've got to let you go.

693
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,753
Half the people you talk to...

694
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,338
[laughter]

695
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,298
...end up committing suicide."

696
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:50,508
[laughter]

697
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,510
I said, "Guys, that's hardly fair.

698
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,180
Most of those were wrong numbers."

699
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,516
-My point...
-[laughter]

700
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,983
My point here is this:

701
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,903
that you should all trust me.

702
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:16,408
You should all believe me
when I tell you that I know my suicide

703
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,453
and murder-suicide number one forever.

704
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,288
[laughter]

705
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:22,790
'Cause what else you got?

706
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:28,087
Doctor-assisted suicide?
Get that weak shit out of here.

707
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,172
[laughter]

708
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:31,840
Fucking kidding me?

709
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,384
[laughter]

710
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,969
Teen suicide?

711
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,304
Teen suicide? No.

712
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,265
College is important.

713
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,683
I'm all about...

714
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,351
[laughter]

715
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,604
I'm all about murder-suicide.
Murder-suicide's the best.

716
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,815
[laughter]

717
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,613
You guys seem like you don't believe me.

718
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,365
[laughter]

719
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:57,575
That's okay.

720
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,243
I'm a pro.

721
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,954
Watch me sell this.

722
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,081
[laughter]

723
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,376
You hear your friend Jeff
just committed suicide.

724
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,878
Your only thought is devastation.

725
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:14,592
"Oh, my God, what could I have done
to save my friend Jeff?"

726
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,054
You hear your friend Jeff
killed his wife and then himself.

727
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,681
You just think, 

728
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,892
"Yikes, Jeff doesn't fuck around, huh?

729
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:27,605
[laughter and applause]

730
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,861
Holy shit, Jeff!

731
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,988
[laughter]

732
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,700
I didn't know the big guy had it in him.

733
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,785
[laughter]

734
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,331
Should have shown Jeff
more respect back in the day.

735
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,915
[laughter]

736
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,167
Jeff was a boss.

737
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,002
He wasn't cleaning that shit up."

738
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:53,881
[laughter and applause]

739
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,300
[cheering]

740
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,348
That...

741
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,184
is just one reason...

742
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:07,144
[laughter]

743
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,898
...why murder-suicide is so great.
Guys, listen to me.

744
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,191
[laughter]

745
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,109
Murder-suicide...

746
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,572
is practically a victimless crime.

747
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,658
[laughter]

748
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,619
You are...

749
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,872
You are allowed to kill your wife.

750
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,084
You are allowed to kill your husband.

751
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:35,089
You've got to be married,
otherwise you seem nuts, but...

752
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,174
[laughter]

753
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:41,011
...you are allowed to murder your spouse,

754
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,890
as long as you just kill yourself
immediately afterwards.

755
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,266
[laughter]

756
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,768
Then there's nothing they can do.

757
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,062
It's even-steven, you're above the law.

758
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,232
[laughter and applause]

759
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,283
What the fuck is wrong
with this crowd tonight?

760
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,369
[laughter]

761
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:10,582
You trying to tell me there are
those among you who are still skeptical?

762
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,668
[laughter]

763
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,505
You saying there are people here
right now who still don't believe me

764
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:20,300
that murder-suicide
is the goddamn cat's pajamas?

765
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,720
[laughter]

766
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,099
Okay.

767
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,892
[laughter]

768
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,020
Then think about it like this.

769
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,397
[laughter]

770
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,899
You're walking down the street.

771
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:39,236
Somebody comes up
and punches you in the face.

772
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,905
You are going to press charges no doubt.

773
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,742
But if you're walking down the street,

774
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,036
somebody comes up,
punches you in the face,

775
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,080
takes a step back,

776
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,084
and then punches themself in the face...

777
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,962
[laughter]

778
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,551
[applause and laughter]

779
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,102
-"Have a good day, sir." Right?
-[laughter]

780
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,775
You wouldn't even tell your friends
about that.

781
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,818
[laughter]

782
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,989
Murder-suicide... [laughs]

783
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:27,785
[laughter and applause]

784
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,621
[cheering and applause]

785
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,789
Shut up!

786
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,874
[laughter]

787
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,218
Murder-suicide is a victimless crime

788
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:47,012
as long as you don't leave behind
any kids.

789
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,182
Got to kill them, too.

790
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,477
[laughter and applause]

791
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,525
That's right,
I was going there the whole time.

792
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,610
[laughter]

793
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:07,574
Now,

794
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,537
I am going to leave you all with this.

795
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,749
And if you've been on the fence
about me tonight, one way or another,

796
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,960
then please, guys, please...

797
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,464
allow me to knock you clean the fuck off.

798
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,383
[laughter]

799
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,140
A couple of months ago...

800
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,105
A couple of months ago, I took
a friend of mine to get an abortion.

801
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,568
Get on board right now
if you are going to.

802
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,653
[laughter and applause]

803
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,947
This is a very long,

804
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,699
very true story.

805
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,741
[laughter]

806
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,788
I took my friend to get an abortion.
Don't worry, guys,

807
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,998
wasn't my baby,

808
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:57,749
wasn't important.

809
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,836
[laughter]

810
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,259
I don't know if you've ever done that.

811
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,096
Ever helped someone to get an abortion.
It's a big favor.

812
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,849
It's a big favor to do for somebody.

813
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,018
Not an easy favor,

814
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,186
not an easy favor at all.

815
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:19,938
Don't get me wrong,

816
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:23,191
I am as pro-choice as they come,
but still...

817
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:27,905
the whole time I'm driving her,
I'm just thinking to myself, "God damn.

818
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,033
There has got to be a better way to...

819
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,493
come up with new material."

820
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,330
[laughter]

821
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,173
And, yes,

822
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:51,303
yes, I did just say I'm pro-choice.
That does not mean I am pro-abortion.

823
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,180
You have other options.

824
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,726
If you don't want your baby,
you can still have your baby delivered.

825
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:02,105
Leave it outside any fire station
in the country...

826
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,440
[laughter]

827
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,192
...they will run it over for you.

828
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,818
[laughter]

829
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:07,778
It's true.

830
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,613
[laughter and applause]

831
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,031
It's true.

832
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,950
[laughter]

833
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,493
It's the law.

834
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,787
[laughter]

835
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:21,667
Far as I'm concerned,
they've been heroes since before 9/11.

836
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,504
[laughter]

837
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,051
Fun little New York joke for you guys.

838
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:33,387
[laughter]

839
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,264
Now...

840
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:44,648
Now people hear me tell this story

841
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:48,276
and they always say the exact same thing,

842
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,072
"Wow, Anthony, you're a good friend.

843
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:54,157
[laughter]

844
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:57,494
You would help someone like that, Anthony.
You're a good friend."

845
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,371
Fuck you. No, I'm not.

846
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,789
[laughter]

847
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,290
I'm not a good friend.

848
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,668
I'm a great friend.

849
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,794
[laughter]

850
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:07,295
You know the difference?

851
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,632
Great friends wake up
at six in the morning.

852
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,802
Great friends drive to your house.

853
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,263
Great friends pick you up

854
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,765
and then take you to get your abortion.

855
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,351
Good friends...

856
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,771
Good friends just babysit.

857
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,524
[laughter and groans]

858
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,485
[laughter and applause]

859
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,911
Now, I have given this a lot of thought,

860
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,872
a lot of thought.

861
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:45,667
And I still don't know
if it had been my baby,

862
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,170
would I have argued to keep it?

863
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,506
I think about that saying they always use,
you know,

864
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,927
"What if your baby
turns out to be a great artist someday?"

865
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:59,222
I don't need that competition.

866
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,267
[laughter]

867
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,732
People ask me, "What was it like?

868
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:12,319
What was it like to take your friend
to get her abortion?"

869
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,446
It was boring.

870
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,906
[laughter]

871
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,576
I don't know why I thought
it was gonna be fun and exciting...

872
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,661
[laughter]

873
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,831
...but trust me,

874
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,126
the only person more disappointed
than me that day

875
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,670
was the baby, all right?

876
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,756
[laughter and groans]

877
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,054
It was so boring.

878
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:44,226
It was just me by myself
for two and a half hours

879
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:47,938
in an abortion clinic waiting room
bored out of my mind.

880
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,232
I don't know if you've ever been

881
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:52,818
to an abortion clinic waiting room before,
but...

882
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,113
the magazines are not great.

883
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,198
[laughter]

884
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,995
The whole place is filled with kids
for some reason.

885
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:06,790
[laughter]

886
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,963
I mean, I thought they were kids.

887
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,091
Turns out they were just ghosts.

888
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,552
-There's a difference...
-[laughter]

889
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,720
...sort of, you know?

890
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,937
Yeah, that's the high point of the story.

891
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:31,064
[laughter]

892
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,608
But I'm only halfway done.

893
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,277
[laughter]

894
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,864
So I'm in this waiting room for so long

895
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:40,866
and I'm so bored

896
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,703
that after a while,
my mind just starts to wander,

897
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,372
and I start to think about my friend

898
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,750
and what she's going through
behind those doors.

899
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,211
And then almost immediately,

900
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,881
I bring it back to myself.

901
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:58,508
[laughter]

902
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,722
And I think, "Anthony,

903
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,309
what are you going to say to her
when she walks out of there?

904
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:10,812
You should think of something nice to say.
You should have a plan."

905
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:15,442
Because I'm not going to lie to you guys,
I blew it when she walked in there.

906
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,902
[laughter]

907
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:20,238
I didn't have anything nice prepared,
I didn't have a plan.

908
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,490
The doctor called her name,

909
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:23,783
she stood up,

910
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,787
turned around to look at me
one last time and I panicked.

911
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,498
I just went, "Um...

912
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,210
"kill 'em in there."

913
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:36,004
[laughter and applause]

914
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,176
I'm not proud of that, you know?

915
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,095
I consider that to be a total failure.

916
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,597
[laughter]

917
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,684
Worst part for sure was the fist bump,
I know that now.

918
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,770
[laughter]

919
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,610
And, yeah, she looked at me
like I'm an asshole, but...

920
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,695
who is she to judge?

921
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,823
[laughter]

922
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,831
But now the pressure is on me.

923
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,919
Think of something nice
for when she walks out of there.

924
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,255
But I'm not good at that.

925
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,464
[laughter]

926
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,049
That's not my specialty.

927
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,845
Thinking up nice things to say
to people in their time of need.

928
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:31,518
The closest option I could come up with
in my own mind was,

929
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,688
"Hey, did you lose weight?"

930
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,189
[laughter]

931
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,315
I know.

932
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,484
I know.

933
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,698
Look, I'm not proud of that either, okay?

934
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,075
That is useless.

935
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,996
I can't say that to my friend.
That is useless.

936
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,874
Except for the fact that it made me laugh.

937
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,419
[laughter]

938
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,504
And that's when I realized

939
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,881
I am chuckling to myself...

940
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,466
[laughter]

941
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,093
...in the waiting room...

942
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,012
[laughter]

943
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,806
...of an abortion clinic.

944
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,516
[laughter]

945
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,102
I catch myself, I stop, I look up.

946
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:17,188
I see a couple sitting
straight across from me.

947
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,901
The guy looks away in disgust
like he wants to fight me.

948
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,196
But the woman leans forward and goes,

949
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,782
"Hey, Anthony, big fan."

950
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,453
[laughter and applause]

951
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:37,292
Which I always appreciate.
Never a bad time for that. Literally...

952
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,460
[laughter]

953
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,295
...any trimester is good.

954
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,672
[laughter]

955
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,973
Couple of minutes later,
a nurse walks out,

956
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,059
comes right up to me,

957
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,145
hands me some paperwork
and says, "Hey,

958
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:00,398
are you here for Jessica's abortion?"

959
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,068
And at his point, I was so bored.

960
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,612
[laughter]

961
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,619
I just stood up as fast as I could
and said, 

962
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,454
"Wait! Don't you mean ultrasound?"

963
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:18,041
[laughter and applause]

964
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,719
And then I laughed for quite some time.

965
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,805
[laughter]

966
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,100
I mean,

967
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,811
really threw my head back on that one.

968
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,604
[laughter]

969
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:45,527
If you're wondering about the nurse,
don't worry, she was a total pro,

970
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,278
did not laugh at all.

971
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,364
[laughter]

972
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,747
So I got a little more time left
in this waiting room,

973
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,750
and it finally dawns on me, "Anthony,

974
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:03,169
you're just a terrible person.

975
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,462
[laughter]

976
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:08,299
And you are never going to think
of something nice to say to your friend.

977
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,302
So why not just get her a present,

978
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,264
get her a gift to make her feel better.

979
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,808
That way, you don't have to say anything."

980
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:19,269
But what do you get

981
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,729
for someone who's just had an abortion?

982
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,149
I had no idea.

983
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:27,569
So I Googled it.

984
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,821
[laughter]

985
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:31,948
You can Google that.

986
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,491
[laughter]

987
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:34,701
It worked.

988
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,911
A website popped up

989
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,582
and I'm glad I looked at it too.
It really helped me out.

990
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,375
'Cause my first thought,

991
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,795
commemorative coin, does not exist.

992
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,172
-[laughter]
-Yeah.

993
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,262
Turns out
it's actually never been a thing.

994
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,847
[laughter]

995
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,390
I must have dreamed it.

996
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,350
[laughter]

997
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:01,519
My second thought:

998
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,313
flowers.

999
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,106
Flowers are always good, right?

1000
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,985
No, not according to this website.

1001
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,071
This website said,
"Do not get her flowers.

1002
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:14,532
Flowers are more of a romantic gesture,

1003
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,368
then she's got to take them home,
put them in water.

1004
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,996
Do not put her through that on this day."

1005
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,290
According to this website,

1006
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,877
flowers are the worst gift
you can get someone 

1007
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,795
after they've just had an abortion.

1008
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,798
Now, I took that advice on the day.

1009
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,510
I still don't think I believe it.

1010
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:38,389
I feel like we can all agree
the worst gift you could get someone

1011
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,934
after they've just had an abortion

1012
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:44,187
would be a to-go box.

1013
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,814
[laughter]

1014
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,068
Think of something worse
and I'll change the fucking joke.

1015
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,028
[laughter]

1016
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,781
The answer is "to-go box."

1017
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,741
[laughter]

1018
00:58:56,908 --> 00:58:58,618
That would be inappropriate.

1019
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:02,413
That would be a real bucket
of cold water

1020
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:04,791
on abortion day. No.

1021
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,001
[laughter]

1022
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:10,630
According to this website,
there's only one gift.

1023
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,299
Only one gift is appropriate

1024
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,010
after someone has just had an abortion.

1025
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:20,515
And that is... a succulent.

1026
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:28,523
-Do you know what a succulent is?
-[laughter]

1027
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:30,900
'Cause I had to Google that shit too.

1028
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:31,859
[laughter]

1029
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:36,322
If you don't know,
a succulent is a desert plant.

1030
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:39,200
It's like a cactus, it's a plant
that doesn't need water.

1031
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:43,162
It's a plant that gets its nutrients
from the air. Give her that.

1032
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,082
I said, "Absolutely not."

1033
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:49,210
I would never do that
to my friend Jessica.

1034
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:52,213
I would never be like,
"Oh, here you go, Jessica.

1035
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,050
Here's something else
you never have to take care of."

1036
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,927
[laughter]

1037
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,097
[applause and laughter]

1038
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,474
[cheering]

1039
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:13,776
I would never do that.
What am I, a monster?

1040
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,069
[laughter]

1041
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,364
So I didn't get her anything.

1042
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,490
[laughter]

1043
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,577
She eventually walked out
from behind those doors.

1044
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,413
I didn't give her anything,
I didn't say anything.

1045
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,831
I just stood up,

1046
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,499
I gave her a hug,

1047
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,544
helped her to the car, drove her home.

1048
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,838
I sat next to her on her couch,

1049
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,549
holding her while she cried.

1050
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:38,343
I was a great friend that day.

1051
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:43,765
Such a great friend that even hours later
after she'd stopped crying,

1052
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:47,894
calmed down and forgotten about
the whole thing forever...

1053
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,772
[laughter]

1054
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,111
...I was still there next to her,

1055
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,739
writing down all these jokes.

1056
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:03,785
[laughter and applause]

1057
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:06,746
Now,

1058
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,290
my favorite part

1059
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:15,713
about having a true 15-minute story
about taking my friend to get her abortion

1060
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:19,008
to end my shows with
are the different reactions

1061
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,551
I get from the audience.

1062
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:27,058
Some people laugh, some people cringe,
some people get visibly upset.

1063
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,352
And the truth is, guys,

1064
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,355
those are all the same to me.

1065
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:35,316
[laughter]

1066
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:40,446
But the best reaction,
my favorite reaction I've ever gotten

1067
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,241
from this story
was just a couple of weeks ago.

1068
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:47,286
A woman in the back of the theater
stands up very confidently

1069
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:50,248
and she screams out, "Excuse me.

1070
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,500
Excuse me, Anthony,

1071
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:56,796
but what the fuck
is so funny about abortion?"

1072
01:01:58,005 --> 01:01:59,215
And I said, "Lady,

1073
01:02:00,341 --> 01:02:01,968
I just told you."

1074
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:04,053
[laughter]

1075
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,806
Thank you very much, everyone.
You've been a wonderful crowd.

1076
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:10,560
[cheering]

1077
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:15,022
[cheering and applause drowns out speech]
