I'm so glad y'all came out tonight!

Y'all here with your loved ones.

Give it up for
everybody here with a date!

Y'all lookin' good!

00:02:35,695 --> 00:02:39,157
First date. Yeah, y'all gotta be careful
when you're first datin',

15
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,492
'cause people
will do anything to get you,

and then when you marry 'em,
they change on you.

00:02:42,744 --> 00:02:45,121
And it's men and women, too.

00:02:45,204 --> 00:02:47,123
'Cause you...
Fellas, you, before you know--

00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:48,708
'Cause you see people,
you out there with your dates,

that's their representative
you out with right now.

You don't know who the hell
you out there sittin' with...

[chuckles]

25
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,308
'Cause, fellas, you ask a woman to do
anything for you before you marry 'em,

26
00:03:05,391 --> 00:03:06,601
if they want you, they gonna do it.

27
00:03:06,685 --> 00:03:09,145
Men, too, they do the same thing.
Men and women do it.

28
00:03:09,228 --> 00:03:11,648
Fellas, you can ask a woman, say,
"Baby, you go get me somethin' to eat?

29
00:03:11,731 --> 00:03:14,317
And somethin' to drink, please?
Something..."

"Okay. Is that all you want?"

"Yeah, baby, that's it.
That's it. Thank you, baby."

Here you go, baby."

36
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:47,559
You do that.
You marry her and ask her,

37
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:49,143
"Baby, you get me somethin' to drink?

38
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:50,437

You just gotta be careful, man.
'Cause I'm tired of datin'.

55
00:04:38,777 --> 00:04:39,819
Datin' ain't cool, man.
Datin' ain't...

56
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:42,321
Especially, you know,
sometimes you date and you think...

57
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,073
You date a little younger than you,
you think that's cool.

58
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:45,158
That ain't cool, man.

59
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,743
This new generation,
there's somethin' wrong with 'em.

60
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:48,537
I don't know what's wrong with 'em.

61
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,833
I'm serious. I was datin' this girl,
and it was goin' good, you know.

62
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:55,544
I thought it was cool.
I said, "This is gonna be good."

63
00:04:55,627 --> 00:04:57,003
You know, we got close,
it was wild,

64
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:58,171
and we started makin' love,
and I was like,

65
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:01,966
"This is good. She might be the one.
She might be the one!"

66
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,843
And I opened up my eyes
and she was tweetin'.

67
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:05,720
I said, "What the hell
you doin' tweetin' with the--

68
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,722

She's like, "People need
to know what you doin'."

"Uh-uh! No! Not this! No!"

74
00:05:21,945 --> 00:05:24,864
I took the phone and said,
"What the hell are you tweetin'?"

75
00:05:24,948 --> 00:05:26,199
Talkin' 'bout
"Chris handlin' his business."

76

but that's it. That's it! That's all."

77
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,411
What the hell's wrong with you?

78
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:36,292

Tired of datin', man.
I dated out of the country.

82
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:53,559
You think people don't know you that well,
but they know.

83
00:05:53,643 --> 00:05:55,645
They know me over there, too.

84
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,481
Dated a girl, man,
who didn't even speak English.

85
00:05:58,564 --> 00:05:59,565
I thought it was cool.
My friend's like,

86
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,901
"Do you realize
she don't even speak English?"

87
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:03,653
I said, "Do you realize
I don't give a damn?

88
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:06,155
Do you see how fine she is?"

89
00:06:06,239 --> 00:06:09,659
All she knew how to say was,
"Money! Money, Chris! Money!"

90
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,828
I should have known there was a problem.

91
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,705
She said,
"What 'bout my family, Chris?"

92
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:16,875
What 'bout..."
I said, "What about your family? Shit."

93
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,252
"They need money, Chris.

94
00:06:21,337 --> 00:06:23,006
You have it. They need it!"

95
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,590
I said, "Shit...

96
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:27,426
I already got a family that want my money.

97
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,014
No, you better go back to your village.
It's over. This is over."

98
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:33,683
"Chris, this is not right, Chris..."

99
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:36,560
"You'd better go learn English,
'cause you don't hear what I'm sayin'."

100
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:39,563
I dated outside my race,
I dated all...

101
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:42,066
I dated a white girl.
It was cool at first.

102
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,945
She had me doin' stuff I never did before,
like showin' up on time, and...

00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:48,156
[audience laughing]

104
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:56,039
Got me hooked on Starbucks.
It was pretty cool.

105
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:58,041
Everything was cool
till she took me rollerbladin'.

106
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,125
Then we broke up.

107
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:02,253
I almost broke my damn ankles
messin' around with her ass.

108
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,213
She was leavin' me and shit.
She was good.

109
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:06,257
She said, "Chris, come on.
It's okay. Follow me!"

110
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,677
Spinnin' around and shit.
"Just relax!

111
00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:12,055
Go side to side like I showed you!

112
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:14,307
You're spillin' your Starbucks, Chris.

113
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:18,144
You can't play basketball
every day, Chris."

114
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:22,148
I said, "This shit sound racist.

115
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,736
Slow your ass down, Samantha!

116
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,530
Told you it was my first time.

117
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:32,701
Get these goddamn rollerblades off me.
It's over. It's over!"

118
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:36,663
I dated a ghetto girl.
I was scared as hell every time...

119
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:41,375
She said, "Close your eyes."
I'd be like, "For what? What for?

120
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:42,460
What you want?"

121
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:47,173
"Ain't nobody tryin' to
rob your punk ass, Chris.

122
00:07:47,256 --> 00:07:50,259
Now put your arms up!" I was like,
"People know where I'm at."

123
00:07:54,055 --> 00:07:56,349
She said,
"No, I don't wanna date no damn punks."

124
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:03,314
Crazy, man!

125
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:04,648
Datin' is crazy, man.

126
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,901
You gotta be careful, man.
You gotta be careful.

127
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:09,237
But you got somebody good, man,
just keep 'em, man. Don't go--

128
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,155
Ain't nothin' out there, keep 'em.

129
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,908
Nothin' out there.
You got somebody that's half good,

130
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,076
try to fix 'em!

131
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:20,248
If they got small problems, not big ones.

132
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:22,291
Those small ones,
you can try to work with 'em.

[audience applauds]

134
00:08:23,626 --> 00:08:25,378
And treat 'em right.
Fellas, surprise your wife!

135
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,462
Surprise your wife.

136
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:28,089
Don't be doin'
the same thing all the time.

137
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:31,342
Buy her roses and sunflowers
and even sunflower seeds.

138
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:34,053
Whatever you can afford,
I don't care.

00:08:34,137 --> 00:08:36,472
"Now, listen, baby, they gonna grow.
They'll grow one day.

You can eat 'em, too, baby."

141
00:08:39,517 --> 00:08:42,686
She'll go,
"Lordy, that's so cute. He's so cute."

142
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:44,731
When I get married,
I want my wife to have a sense of humor,

00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:47,358
'cause I'm-a surprise her. She ain't
gonna know what the hell I'm-a do.

00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,371
I don't care though.
I tell 'em. I tell 'em.

303
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:40,956
I say,
"Look, people owe me, too. Shit."

304
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:51,425
"I'm serious." I said,
"Call Terry, he owes me $200.

305
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,511
Put that down on the bill."

306
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:58,140
They say, "We don't know who no Terry is,
or where he is."

307
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,559
I say, "I don't know
where his ass at neither!

308
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:03,271
Let's find his ass!

309
00:17:03,354 --> 00:17:05,231
Can't you see he's the problem? Shit.

310
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:10,444
We're up here fussing,
he's running free with our money.

311
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,198
You gotta look at
who's the problem here."

312
00:17:16,575 --> 00:17:20,288
Bill collectors make me sick.
They always go, "We need the money."

313
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:23,165
They act like
you owe them the money personally.

314
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,083
"We need the money."

315
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:29,129
I said, "Look, I don't owe you
a goddamn thing.

316
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:33,008
You know what I mean?

317
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,302
I owe the company the money.

318
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:38,221
You stay the hell out of me
and that American Express' business."

319
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:45,646
American Express make me sick, too.

320
00:17:45,729 --> 00:17:49,024
I should have left home without it.
They get on my goddamn nerve.

321
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:54,488
They don't tell you to stop, but they
want their money when you owe 'em.

322
00:17:54,572 --> 00:17:56,031
"Uh, you're overdue."

323
00:17:56,114 --> 00:17:58,992
"So, why y'all didn't stop me?"

324
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,744
I've been getting so much
on a credit card, I'll be like,

325
00:18:00,828 --> 00:18:04,415
"I think somebody else did it."
I'm like, "Who the hell did this shit?

326
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:06,542
I didn't buy all this shit!

327
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,337
When the hell did I buy a statue?"

328
00:18:11,297 --> 00:18:13,299
"May I remind you, I've seen you
shopping with Michael Jackson."

329
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:14,925
"Oh, shit!"

330
00:18:15,008 --> 00:18:18,304
I remember that.
Michael talked me into getting that shit.

331
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:19,555
You ever loan somebody some money

332
00:18:19,638 --> 00:18:22,475
and they get an attitude with you
when you ask for it back?

333
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,437
And they'd be like, "God damn, man! Shit!

334
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,271
God damn!

335
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:32,485
You're still worried
about that little-ass money?"

336
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,823
He looked me up and down like this,
"Little-ass money..."

337
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:43,787
"That shit wasn't little
when you borrowed it, God damn it!

338
00:18:43,871 --> 00:18:45,914
Give me my goddamn money!"

339
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:53,506
"Rich as you is?

340
00:18:53,589 --> 00:18:55,048
Let me tell you how much money you got."

341
00:18:55,132 --> 00:18:57,885
"No, what?
No, no, you don't know what I got."

342
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:02,931
"Damn, man, I told you
I was gonna pay you on Tuesday. Shit."

343
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:05,058
"Well, you told me last Tuesday,
not any Tuesday, man.

344
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,770
Go get my goddamn money!

345
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:10,606
What the hell is wrong with you?"

346
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:12,941
That's why when people ask me for money,
I take pictures of them now.

347
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:15,819
I take pictures
'cause they don't remember.

348
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,112
They don't remember!

349
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:19,281
When they was crying and shit
when they was asking for the money,

350
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:20,908
I take pictures of 'em.
I say, "Remember this shit?

351
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:23,411
Look at this picture. Look at it.
Remember, you was begging.

352
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,912
You was crying so much.
You don't wanna live no more.

353
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:26,789
You see this shit.

354
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:31,168
Give me my goddamn money, man!"

355
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:32,586
Then they try to deny it,
"Man, that ain't me."

356
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,171
"That's a close-up shot.
That is you!

357
00:19:34,254 --> 00:19:36,715
That's when you was on your knees.
Right there!

358
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:40,135
Give me my damn money!"

359
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:44,682
You can't trust nobody, man.

360
00:19:44,765 --> 00:19:46,850
I'm gonna be like Oprah.
Oprah Winfrey don't trust nobody.

361
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:49,728
That's why she's so rich.
Oprah don't trust nobody.

362
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:52,815
I remember one time Oprah invited
all these celebrities to her house,

363
00:19:52,898 --> 00:19:54,900
and I came and all these celebrities
were in her house,

364
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:57,445
and everybody came over,
and she had everybody in the yard.

365
00:19:57,528 --> 00:19:58,654
Wouldn't let nobody in the house.

366
00:19:58,737 --> 00:20:01,323
We was like, "God damn!
What kind of shit is that?"

367
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:02,825
[audience laughing]

368
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,288
Everybody asked everybody,
"Have you been in the house?"

369
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,873
"No, I haven't, no."

370
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:15,003
-"You've been in the house?"
-"No, that's why I asked you."

371
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:17,923
"I mean, she won't let nobody in there,
but Gayle and Maya Angelou. Shit.

372
00:20:18,006 --> 00:20:19,007
Damn.

373
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,053
'Cause she don't trust nobody else."

374
00:20:23,136 --> 00:20:24,597
I tried to get in with Maya Angelou.

375
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,098
Told Maya Angelou
I need to use the bathroom.

376
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,434
"Miss Angelou, I gotta use the bathroom.
Can I go in there with you?"

377
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,102
She was like, "Hell, no, son!"

378
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:31,645
[audience laughing]

379
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:35,941
"Who the hell do you think I am?
You know I'm wise.

380
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:38,486
Oprah don't want nobody in that house.

381
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,447
I'm gonna get me a ride
back on that plane.

382
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,906
Shit, I gotta go home tomorrow."

383
00:20:46,535 --> 00:20:48,954
Everybody want you to trust 'em.

384
00:20:49,037 --> 00:20:51,081
McDonald's got two windows.

385
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,085
Two windows!

386
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:59,673
One where you pay
and the other one where you get your food.

387
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:02,009
I'm like, "Man, if I give y'all
my money, I want my food, man.

388
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:04,052
Same time! Same time!

389
00:21:06,472 --> 00:21:08,891
What the hell is wrong with y'all?

390
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:13,937
You better go up there
and get my goddamn food, man!"

391
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:16,439
"Sir, sir, your food is
at the next window, calm down."

392
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:20,277
"No, no, you take your ass up there.
You go get my food and come back.

393
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:29,119
I gave you my money, I want my food, man!

394
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:31,789
I don't know you, man!

395
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:33,331
I don't know who the hell
at that next window.

396
00:21:33,415 --> 00:21:37,210
That could be another store.
I don't know who the hell up there."

397
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:39,838
People blowing their horns behind me,

398
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:43,175
so I said, "Man, they're playing
with people's food up here!

399
00:21:43,258 --> 00:21:45,886
Y'all can fall for this shit,
but not me!

400
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:49,222
Now, go get my food, man.

401
00:21:49,306 --> 00:21:52,768
You go up there and get my food,
and you come back, that's what you do.

402
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:54,477
All right, you don't wanna do that?
I ain't going then.

403
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,396
I'll stay right here.
I don't give a damn.

404
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,071
[audience laughing and applauding]

405
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,245
Go get my food, man!"

406
00:22:12,329 --> 00:22:14,540
They gonna call the cops on me.
Do you believe that shit?

407
00:22:14,623 --> 00:22:17,167
Any cops in here?

408
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,669
Where they at?

409
00:22:21,213 --> 00:22:24,382
Y'all play too much. Where they at?
Cops play too much, don't they?

410
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,260
They play too much.
They're childish.

411
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:33,183
Hiding in the woods,
waiting for somebody to speed.

412
00:22:33,266 --> 00:22:34,559
Man, that's childish!

413
00:22:34,643 --> 00:22:36,353
[audience cheering]

414
00:22:44,402 --> 00:22:48,115
You trying to go to work,
they playing hide-and-go-see and shit.

415
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,867
You know how they do,
hiding and shit?

416
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,202
Just hiding behind stuff.
You know how they...

417
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:54,955
[audience laughing]

418
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:00,335
"Shit.

419
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,842
Shit.

420
00:23:14,224 --> 00:23:17,394
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Oh!"

421
00:23:17,477 --> 00:23:19,479
[mimicking police siren]

422
00:23:24,985 --> 00:23:26,987
Making all that damn noise,
messing up your hearing and shit.

423
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,489
"Man, turn the shit down.
You got me!"

424
00:23:31,574 --> 00:23:34,494
Messing up my damn hearing
over a damn ticket!

425
00:23:37,122 --> 00:23:38,999
Then they're talking with you
like you're some little kid.

426
00:23:39,082 --> 00:23:41,418
"Turn that goddamn car off, boy.

427
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,970
Turn it off!

428
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:54,597
APB, we need a three-four-five.

429
00:23:54,682 --> 00:23:56,474
Tupac just went through here
like a goddamn bat out of hell.

430
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:57,559
Get down here now!

431
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,403
Where the hell were you going, boy?"

432
00:24:09,654 --> 00:24:11,073
"You ain't my daddy.
Who the hell are you?

433
00:24:11,156 --> 00:24:13,616
Don't talk to me like that.
You ain't my daddy."

434
00:24:15,452 --> 00:24:17,120
"Why was you speeding, boy?"

435
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:21,124
"'Cause I didn't see you."

436
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:22,835
[audience laughing]

437
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:31,760
"Why was you hiding, man?
Tell me that. Why was you hiding?

438
00:24:31,844 --> 00:24:34,596
That shit ain't fair, man!

439
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,682
There's good people out here
trying to go to work.

440
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:38,976
Playing games and shit."

441
00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:41,353
"Boy, watch your mouth, son!

442
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,647
Now, I ain't gonna tell you again!

443
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:49,527
One more time, out of you.
One more time.

444
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:54,574
Now, you've seen us behind you.

445
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:59,204
Why the hell you start speeding up?"

446
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,208
"'Cause you was catching up, that's why.

447
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:09,339
I don't just give up.
My mama didn't raise me like that."

448
00:25:10,673 --> 00:25:13,093
Cops, man.
That's why I love when I get over on 'em.

449
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:15,303
Don't you love it
when you get over on a cop?

450
00:25:15,387 --> 00:25:16,764
When you're speeding
and you think they got you

451
00:25:16,847 --> 00:25:19,474
but they done already pulled
somebody over. Don't you love that?

754
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:59,080
"He need his own place. Shit.

755
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:02,249
Always turning the TV and shit.

756
00:41:04,293 --> 00:41:06,713
Nobody wanna watch no damn Dallas."

757
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,632
[chuckling]

758
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:13,094
He thought we were sad,
and he came back one day to talk to us,

759
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:15,221
we was like, "Oh, shit, I know
he ain't comin' back, is he?"

760
00:41:17,556 --> 00:41:19,892
I said, "Daddy, you ain't
coming back, are you?

761
00:41:21,643 --> 00:41:23,645
Don't be a quitter now."

762
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:25,732
[audience laughing]

763
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:32,780
"You don't want us to grow up
to be quitters, do you?

764
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:35,742
Besides, we done took your room.
Mama in our room now.

765
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:37,534
We got the big room."

766
00:41:37,618 --> 00:41:39,620
"Go get your ass out in front of me."

767
00:41:41,413 --> 00:41:44,083
I worked for my daddy, too.
Don't work for family.

768
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,961
You ever work for family?
Don't work for family.

769
00:41:47,044 --> 00:41:49,088
You ever got a whoopin' at your job?

770
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:52,717
That's embarrassin' as hell.

771
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,053
My daddy would...
My daddy would whoop us anywhere.

772
00:41:56,137 --> 00:41:57,554
"Get your ass in there.
Do what I told you to do."

773
00:41:57,638 --> 00:41:58,890
I'm like, "Daddy, come on,
wait till we get home."

774
00:41:58,973 --> 00:42:00,016
"You don't wait for me, God damn it.

775
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:02,184
-You'll do what the hell I tell you to."
-"Daddy, please!"

776
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:10,692
My daddy come home
and just whoop everybody in the house.

777
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:12,862
Be whoopin' my friends and shit.

778
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,572
"Get your ass up there.
Do what I told you to do."

779
00:42:15,656 --> 00:42:18,075
"Mr. Tucker,
Mr. Tucker, I ain't your son!"

780
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:23,622
"Get your ass out of my house, then.
I told you not to come down here.

781
00:42:23,705 --> 00:42:26,250
You need an ass-whoopin'
anyway, God damn it."

782
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:27,752
"I'm-a tell my daddy."

783
00:42:27,835 --> 00:42:30,671
"I catch him in my house,
I'm-a whoop his ass, too!"

784
00:42:36,302 --> 00:42:39,096
One time, my daddy whooped me
and my brother like slaves.

785
00:42:40,306 --> 00:42:42,767
Like two slaves,
'cause he came home, he was mad.

786
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,977
He came home from the Atlanta dairy,
he was mad.

787
00:42:45,061 --> 00:42:46,478
We didn't know he was mad.

788
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:49,231
We did something, broke something,
so we tried to tell on each other.

789
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:50,357
So we ran up to him,

790
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:52,276
-"Daddy, he did it."
-"No, he did it, Dad."

791
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:54,653
My daddy whooped both of us.
He said, "Both of y'all go downstairs,

792
00:42:54,736 --> 00:42:55,905
take your clothes off,
and lay on the couch."

793
00:42:55,988 --> 00:42:58,074
We was like, "What the fuck?"

794
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:00,159
[audience laughing]

795
00:43:09,168 --> 00:43:10,669
"What Daddy say?"

796
00:43:10,752 --> 00:43:12,588
[breathing heavily]

797
00:43:12,671 --> 00:43:17,551
"All I heard was lay down there
butt-naked or something, on the couch."

798
00:43:17,634 --> 00:43:18,886
"Oh, shit.

799
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:22,807
We shouldn't have said nothing, man."

800
00:43:23,933 --> 00:43:25,810
We were downstairs, man,
my daddy was--

801
00:43:25,893 --> 00:43:28,270
Waiting, butt-naked on the couch.

802
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:32,483
Lookin' at each other,
"What the hell we do, man?

803
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:34,401
Why did we say something?"

804
00:43:35,652 --> 00:43:37,613
[sobbing]

805
00:43:45,162 --> 00:43:47,748
My brother tried to be strong,
"Be strong, boy.

806
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,920
You hear me, Chris?
Don't let him break you, Chris.

807
00:43:54,671 --> 00:43:57,049
Don't let him break you."

808
00:43:57,716 --> 00:44:01,470
[sobbing] "Okay, okay, okay, okay."

809
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:05,474
"Cry inside, Chris."

810
00:44:07,476 --> 00:44:09,103
"Okay, okay."

811
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:12,814
He hit my brother first, he's like...
[popping]

812
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:17,111
My brother said,
"Ahhh! Daddy, I'm sorry, Daddy!"

813
00:44:20,072 --> 00:44:22,992
I laughed so hard, I didn't even hurt
when he was whooping me.

814
00:44:23,075 --> 00:44:26,537
[laughing]
"Daddy. Daddy, stop."

815
00:44:30,041 --> 00:44:32,251
We were in the room, like,
"What's all that 'be strong' shit?

816
00:44:32,334 --> 00:44:34,378
What happened to that, where did that go?

817
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:36,463
Hmm? Where'd that go?"

818
00:44:37,798 --> 00:44:40,842
"Daddy hit me hard
'cause I'm older and shit."

819
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:42,136
"Yeah, right."

820
00:44:43,845 --> 00:44:45,264
Yeah, man.

821
00:44:46,682 --> 00:44:48,600
My daddy is somethin' else, man.

822
00:44:48,684 --> 00:44:50,144
It's a trip though, being the youngest.

823
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:51,520
I'm the youngest of six kids.

824
00:44:51,603 --> 00:44:54,565
You learn a lot
when you the youngest of six kids.

825
00:44:54,648 --> 00:44:57,068
You learn what not to do.

826
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,153
'Cause I seen my brothers
and sisters get whoopin',

827
00:44:59,236 --> 00:45:01,197
and I'd be like, "What'd you do?
Why Daddy whoop you like that?

828
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,740
God damn. Shit.

829
00:45:03,824 --> 00:45:06,660
Daddy tore your ass up, what'd you do?"

830
00:45:07,954 --> 00:45:10,539
"I didn't take out the garbage."

831
00:45:10,622 --> 00:45:15,461
"All that was over garbage? Shit.

832
00:45:16,462 --> 00:45:17,754
Damn.

833
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:23,010
Daddy's serious about the garbage, huh?

834
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:25,972
[exhaling sharply]

835
00:45:26,055 --> 00:45:28,224
What day the garbage man come? What day?

836
00:45:30,267 --> 00:45:33,437
Tuesday. Okay,
I'll remember that shit. Tuesday."

837
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,856
Being the youngest,
you don't get no college fund.

838
00:45:35,939 --> 00:45:37,483
My brothers and sisters
messed that all up.

839
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:42,196
I asked my dad about college, he was like,
"Shit. You better find something to do.

840
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:52,206
Talk to your brothers and sisters.

841
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:54,916
They had your college fund.
They messed it up."

842
00:45:56,335 --> 00:45:57,961
That was okay, though,
I didn't care, shoot.

843
00:45:58,045 --> 00:45:59,796
I barely got out of high school.

844
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,299
I wasn't gonna start
that shit all over again.

845
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,636
I was barely... I barely got out.

846
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:06,803
My teacher kept me back.

847
00:46:06,887 --> 00:46:08,097
I said, "What you keepin' me back for?

848
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,267
I don't wanna see you again
and you don't wanna see me again.

849
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,602
Let me go!
See what I can do.

850
00:46:14,978 --> 00:46:17,439
Let me be all I could be!"

851
00:46:17,523 --> 00:46:19,358
I used to get on teachers' nerves,
they used to hate me.

852
00:46:19,441 --> 00:46:21,693
They used to get mad.
They'd say,

853
00:46:21,777 --> 00:46:25,156
"Listen, Chris, if you act up again,
I'm gonna call your mama."

854
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:27,783
I said, "If you gonna call my mama,
you gonna have to pay the phone bill,

855
00:46:27,866 --> 00:46:30,994
'cause the phone been
cut off for two weeks."

856
00:46:31,078 --> 00:46:33,080
[audience laughing]

857
00:46:38,877 --> 00:46:41,088
She'd be pissed off,
"Get out of my room!

858
00:46:42,548 --> 00:46:45,967
You make me sick!
Go to the principal office!"

859
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:47,886
I'd go to the principal's office,
I didn't care

860
00:46:47,969 --> 00:46:49,555
because I was in
the principal's office so much,

861
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:52,474
I was cool with the principal,
we were tight.

862
00:46:52,558 --> 00:46:55,644
He'd be like, "What'd you do this time?
Get in here, get in here.

863
00:46:56,603 --> 00:46:58,355
Get in here, close the door.

864
00:46:58,439 --> 00:47:01,525
Sit down.
What'd you do this time?"

865
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:05,279
-"Call my mama, pay the phone bill."
-"Man, you crazy!

866
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:12,161
You're a fool, Chris.

867
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:14,955
You're a fool, boy.

868
00:47:16,165 --> 00:47:17,791
You gonna make me suspend your ass.

869
00:47:17,874 --> 00:47:20,211
I'm just playing. I'm just playing.
We ain't gonna suspend you.

870
00:47:21,837 --> 00:47:23,380
Give me my peanuts."

871
00:47:23,464 --> 00:47:27,008
I used to sell candy.
I had the principal hooked on peanuts.

872
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:29,010
He was hooked on salt.
He'd be mad if I don't show up.

873
00:47:29,095 --> 00:47:31,638
"Where the hell you was yesterday? Shit.

874
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,440
Shit. You got me hooked me on this shit,
and you don't show up for school.

875
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:45,444
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, boy.

876
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:47,571
I can only do so much, Chris.

877
00:47:49,906 --> 00:47:52,576
You know I'm playing.
Get out of here.

878
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:54,911
Don't be late, boy.
Don't be late again."

879
00:47:57,539 --> 00:47:59,541
School was fun, man.
I found out--

880
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:02,669
I tried to play sports, you know,
every guy wanna play sports.

881
00:48:02,753 --> 00:48:05,088
I ended up not playing it.
I wasn't that good.

882
00:48:05,172 --> 00:48:07,258
I tried to play football,
I wasn't that good.

883
00:48:07,341 --> 00:48:09,843
I broke both of my wrists
in practice and shit.

884
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:12,304
Ambulance came, they were like,

885
00:48:12,388 --> 00:48:14,556
"God, how you do that shit?"

886
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,100
I said, "Man, just take me
to the doctor. God damn.

887
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:20,771
I don't know how I did it. Damn!

888
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:23,982
Take me to the hospital!

889
00:48:24,065 --> 00:48:26,193
Stop asking all these damn questions!

890
00:48:28,945 --> 00:48:30,156
Shit."

891
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:37,371
I used to play, man,
'cause I wanted that jersey for pep rally.

892
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:38,955
I wanted that jersey
'cause I wanted to run out there.

893
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:40,291
That's how you get the girls.

894
00:48:40,374 --> 00:48:43,169
I used to run out there in the pep rally,
I used to run out there.

895
00:48:43,252 --> 00:48:45,629
Jersey clean, I ain't played one game.

896
00:48:48,965 --> 00:48:50,384
Coach never let me in a game.

897
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:52,553
I'm up there, I be in the bench
talking about the team

898
00:48:52,636 --> 00:48:54,971
'cause we losing, "They sorry as hell.

899
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,476
We'd win if he'd put me
in the game. Shit."

900
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,728
One time, somebody got hurt.
Coach put me in the game.

901
00:49:01,812 --> 00:49:03,146
I was like, "What the hell?"
He said,

902
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:06,650
-"Tucker, get up here!"
-"What the hell he want?"

903
00:49:10,654 --> 00:49:12,864
"I want you to go in the game,
wide receiver. Somebody got hurt."

904
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:14,157
"Shit."

905
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:19,288
I didn't know none of their plays.
I was like, "Shit.

906
00:49:22,458 --> 00:49:24,835
Coach, game almost over--"

907
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:27,838
-"Get in the game!"
-"What--"

908
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:31,174
I got out there, I ain't care, I said,
"Okay, shit, I'll go out there."

909
00:49:31,258 --> 00:49:32,343
Quarterback say he's running with--

910
00:49:32,426 --> 00:49:33,969
In the huddle,
he said we gonna run, run the ball.

911
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:36,054
They gonna run the ball.
I said, "He ain't gonna throw it to me,

912
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,306
so I'm gonna have some fun."

913
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:39,391
I was good, because I played
with my older brothers and sisters.

914
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:40,851
I could fake somebody out
in a minute, I was good.

915
00:49:43,061 --> 00:49:45,105
Playing street ball. I could... Whoa!

916
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,025
I said, "I'm gonna fake them out.
I'm gonna get out there."

917
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:51,152
He hiked the ball,
and I faked it.

918
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:53,154
Ah! He fell down. I was like...

919
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:56,116
[whooshes]
I was out there, I said, "Oh, shit."

920
00:49:57,158 --> 00:49:59,536
I saw my mama in the stands,
I said, "Hey, Mama.

921
00:50:01,705 --> 00:50:02,956
I'm going pro.

922
00:50:04,625 --> 00:50:06,377
I'll buy you a house, Mama."

923
00:50:08,295 --> 00:50:10,756
I knew I was cool.
He was gonna run the ball.

924
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,674
All of a sudden,
quarterback threw the ball at me,

925
00:50:12,758 --> 00:50:15,761
I was like, "What the fuck
are you throwin' it at me for?

926
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:22,934
Oh, shit, that ain't the play,
God damn, man!

927
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,733
He knew I didn't go
to practice last week. Shit."

928
00:50:29,816 --> 00:50:31,318
I was hoping something would happen,

929
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:34,112
like a bird would hit the ball
or somethin',

930
00:50:34,195 --> 00:50:35,531
a little rain or somethin'.

931
00:50:35,614 --> 00:50:38,284
Ball came, I dropped it,
I was like, "Shit."

932
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,201
My whole family was up cheering.
Everybody's like...

933
00:50:40,286 --> 00:50:43,914
I dropped the ball, they was like,
"That ain't our brother.

934
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:46,583
Our brother's number ten.
We don't know who that was. We don't.

935
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:47,918
Come on, Mama, let's go.

936
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:51,547
Come on, he gave up on us,
we're gonna give up on him. Shit.

937
00:50:51,630 --> 00:50:54,383
Embarrass the Tuckers like that.
Let's get out of here."

938
00:50:55,509 --> 00:50:56,718
Oh.

939
00:50:56,802 --> 00:50:58,637
We had fun in school.

940
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,307
My daddy one of the daddies,
he'd do stuff with us.

941
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:04,017
That's what he was cool about.
He did a lot of stuff with us.

942
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,812
But it was cool until he forget
we was his kids and shit.

943
00:51:07,979 --> 00:51:11,442
One time, he called my sister a bitch,
and we was like, "God damn, Daddy!"

944
00:51:13,944 --> 00:51:16,029
We was playing cards
and she said he didn't put up.

945
00:51:16,112 --> 00:51:17,197
He got mad as hell,

946
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,116
"She gonna tell me
what I God damn did, shit.

947
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,203
I put my money up."

948
00:51:23,787 --> 00:51:27,541
-We was like, "Daddy!"
-"I don't give a damn shit.

949
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:30,001
I knew her when she couldn't talk or walk.

950
00:51:32,253 --> 00:51:35,131
Don't tell me what I did, God damn it."

951
00:51:36,132 --> 00:51:38,259
My sister was crying. I was like,
"It's gonna be all right."

952
00:51:38,344 --> 00:51:40,387
[crying] She's like, "Uh-uh, uh-uh.

953
00:51:40,471 --> 00:51:43,682
My daddy called me a bitch. Uh-uh."

954
00:51:43,765 --> 00:51:46,101
I said, "Stop it, stop it. It's okay.

955
00:51:46,184 --> 00:51:48,562
He done called everybody something.

956
00:51:52,023 --> 00:51:54,275
He called me a punk bitch.
Let it go.

957
00:51:56,987 --> 00:52:00,031
Now get your head up
and get back in the game."

958
00:52:04,285 --> 00:52:05,371
My daddy funny, man.

959
00:52:05,454 --> 00:52:08,081
One time he lost his mind
playing cards over at my sister's house.

960
00:52:08,164 --> 00:52:09,958
Lost his mind.
He was losing a lot of money,

961
00:52:10,041 --> 00:52:11,752
and lost his mind.

962
00:52:11,835 --> 00:52:13,545
He thought my sister's roaches
was helping her cheat.

963
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:15,464
Boy, it got shit crazy.

964
00:52:16,507 --> 00:52:18,842
'Cause he kept getting
bad hand after bad hand.

965
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:22,303
He just got frustrated.
He was dealing and--

966
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:25,682
We didn't know how much money he lost,
but he just got to hallucinating stuff.

967
00:52:25,766 --> 00:52:27,601
He would be just shuffling his cards.

968
00:52:34,274 --> 00:52:35,692
[mouthing]

969
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,041
"Shit."

970
00:52:57,548 --> 00:52:59,508
He'd shuffle them again
like his hand gonna change.

971
00:53:17,818 --> 00:53:19,820
[audience laughing]

972
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,043
"I knew there was
some shit going on in here.

973
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,174
How long that goddamn roach been on
that wall, looking at my goddamn hand?

974
00:53:44,553 --> 00:53:47,556
I wanna know who the hell
working with this roach."

975
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:51,101
My friends are all, "God damn.

976
00:53:52,143 --> 00:53:53,812
Your daddy crazy as hell.

977
00:53:55,063 --> 00:53:56,356
We quit, man.
Y'all can have the money.

978
00:53:56,439 --> 00:53:57,899
There's something wrong
with your family, man.

979
00:53:57,983 --> 00:53:59,818
Y'all gotta work that shit out."

980
00:54:01,152 --> 00:54:03,947
My mama wasn't like that.
My mama was different, my mama was strict.

981
00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:05,281
Anybody got a strict mama?

982
00:54:05,365 --> 00:54:07,868
My mama told you something,
she meant it.

983
00:54:07,951 --> 00:54:11,622
One time, my mama told me...
I got lost in the mall.

984
00:54:11,705 --> 00:54:14,708
My mama didn't even look for me.
She didn't even look for me.

985
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:21,297
I had to find a security guard
to help me look for my mama.

986
00:54:21,381 --> 00:54:24,718
I was like, "Come on, man,
hurry up, before she leaves. Mama!

987
00:54:26,052 --> 00:54:27,679
Mama, where you at?

988
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:33,268
Mama! I'm sorry!"

989
00:54:35,186 --> 00:54:38,524
Man, I went everywhere in that mall
looking for my mama.

990
00:54:38,607 --> 00:54:41,026
My mama wasn't even in the mall no more.

991
00:54:42,986 --> 00:54:45,822
Found my mama
in the parking lot backing back.

992
00:54:46,948 --> 00:54:49,450
I was like,
"There she go. Mama!

993
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:52,579
[sobbing] I'm sorry, Mama."

994
00:54:54,205 --> 00:54:56,207
She's like, "Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

995
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,459
I thought you had a ride home.
The car is too full."

996
00:54:58,544 --> 00:55:00,295
[mimics engine accelerating]

997
00:55:00,378 --> 00:55:01,797
[mimics tires screeching]

998
00:55:04,007 --> 00:55:05,717
"Mama, I'm only five years old!"

999
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:07,803
"But you think you grown.
I told you not to leave my side!"

1000
00:55:07,886 --> 00:55:09,888
[mimics engine accelerating
and tires screeching]

1001
00:55:15,727 --> 00:55:16,937
"Mama!"

1002
00:55:17,979 --> 00:55:19,439
I thought she was gonna come back,

1003
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:22,317
she left me out there all night long,
I'll tell you something.

1004
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,610
[sniffles]

1005
00:55:23,694 --> 00:55:25,612
Wouldn't nobody even kidnap me.

1006
00:55:31,534 --> 00:55:34,746
Kidnappers don't kidnap black kids.
We too much trouble.

1007
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:38,458
We ask too many questions.

1008
00:55:39,835 --> 00:55:42,629
We'll be in the backseat asking questions,
we won't be quiet.

1009
00:55:42,713 --> 00:55:45,548
We'll be scared, but we
wanna know what's going on.

1010
00:55:50,887 --> 00:55:53,599
[breathing shallowly]
"Mr. Kidnapper?

1011
00:55:55,642 --> 00:55:57,268
Mr. Kidnapper?

1012
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:00,772
Where we going?

1013
00:56:06,695 --> 00:56:08,154
Mr. Kidnapper?

1014
00:56:10,531 --> 00:56:12,075
When we gonna eat?"

1015
00:56:12,158 --> 00:56:13,744
[audience laughing]

00:56:23,128 --> 00:56:24,545
"Mr. Kidnapper?

1017
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:28,383
Mr. Kidnapper?

1018
00:56:30,176 --> 00:56:34,097
Can you put the radio
to a black radio station, please?"

1019

[audience applauding and laughing]

00:56:46,026 --> 00:56:49,529
"Maybe a little Babyface,
Earth, Wind & Fire or somethin'?

1021
00:56:49,612 --> 00:56:51,156
I'm getting a little scared, man."

1022
00:56:52,073 --> 00:56:53,784
Kidnapper just goes,
"Just get the hell out, boy!

1023
00:56:53,867 --> 00:56:56,286
Get the hell out of the car!

1024
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:59,205
Drive me even more crazy, God damn!

1025
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:03,459
Do you realize
your life is in danger, boy?

1026
00:57:03,543 --> 00:57:04,670
Get out!"

1027

[sputtering]

1028
00:57:06,421 --> 00:57:08,423
"You kidnapped me, man!

1029
00:57:10,258 --> 00:57:13,219
You get more money
if you keep me alive. Shit."

1030
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:15,305
Yeah, my mama, man, she didn't play, man.

1031
00:57:15,388 --> 00:57:17,933
My mama made us go to church.
Made us.

1032
00:57:18,016 --> 00:57:20,644
We hadn't even sinned yet,
we still had to go to church.

1033
00:57:21,937 --> 00:57:24,314
"All right, get up.
You are going to church!"

1034
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:27,400
"Mama, can't the preacher
come here sometimes?

1035
00:57:29,695 --> 00:57:31,321
We always going to him.

1036
00:57:32,864 --> 00:57:35,701
He can preach on the kitchen table, Mama."

1037
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:37,703
"Get up! You are going to church!

1038
00:57:37,786 --> 00:57:41,081
Make me sick.
Making me late."

1039
00:57:41,164 --> 00:57:43,249
She's always talkin' bout
we making her late.

1040
00:57:43,333 --> 00:57:45,168
And she ain't dressed, neither.

1041
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,672
Walkin' around with her bra on.

1042
00:57:48,755 --> 00:57:50,590
"You are making me late!

1043
00:57:51,717 --> 00:57:54,761
I can't get dressed
fooling around with y'all!"

1044
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:01,142
"You can't get dressed
'cause you ain't dressed, Mama.

1045
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:04,980
You late, too.
We're just a late family."

1046
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:08,316
"Making me sick!"

1047
00:58:08,399 --> 00:58:09,776
She'd be mad at us every Sunday.

1048
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,902
She'd fix her some breakfast,

1049
00:58:10,986 --> 00:58:12,528
she wouldn't fix us nothin',
she'd be mad at us.

1050
00:58:12,612 --> 00:58:15,490
We'd be so late
she gotta eat it in the car.

1051
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:18,159
She'd come to the car with her food.

1052
00:58:18,243 --> 00:58:21,162
And one time she brought it to the car
and gave it to me to hold,

1053
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:25,333
but I didn't hear what she said,
and I thought she was giving it to me.

1054
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,710
And I ate my mama's breakfast.

1055
00:58:26,793 --> 00:58:29,170
Man, I ain't never seen her
this mad before.

1056
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,382
'Cause all I heard was, "Here."

1057
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:37,053
I didn't hear, "Hold this."
I didn't hear that.

1058
00:58:38,138 --> 00:58:40,140
And she says,
"Get that door! Get the door!

1059
00:58:40,223 --> 00:58:43,143
You make me sick.
Every Sunday, we gotta go through this!

1060
00:58:44,185 --> 00:58:45,395
Here!

1061
00:58:46,813 --> 00:58:48,231
Hold that."

1062
00:58:49,607 --> 00:58:51,067
And I got it, I was like, "Huh?

1063
00:58:52,527 --> 00:58:54,738
I thought Mama was mad at us.

1064
00:58:56,239 --> 00:58:59,200
Well, she said, 'Here.'

1065
00:59:32,692 --> 00:59:34,527
Why'd Mama fix me coffee?"

1066
00:59:39,032 --> 00:59:42,452
My brother was in the backseat,
"Man, what the hell you doing?

1067
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:45,413
That's Mama food."

1068
00:59:46,747 --> 00:59:47,958
"Shut up.

1069
00:59:49,793 --> 00:59:52,003
Can't stand to see me have nothing.

1070
01:00:01,012 --> 01:00:04,182
Just like Grandmamma said,
'Crabs in the bucket.

1071
01:00:05,892 --> 01:00:08,394
Don't even have to put a lid on the top.'

1072
01:00:10,021 --> 01:00:11,940
Mama fixed this for me!

1073
01:00:14,192 --> 01:00:16,444
Mad 'cause you ain't in the front seat.

1074
01:00:18,654 --> 01:00:19,823
Make me sick."

1075
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:22,742
All of a sudden, my mama said,
"Hand me my plate."

1076
01:00:33,711 --> 01:00:34,795
"Shut up.

1077
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,632
Mama, what'd you say?"

1078
01:00:39,425 --> 01:00:41,177
"Boy, I said, hand me my plate!"

1079
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,097
"Mama, you mean the plate you gave me?"

1080
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:47,517
"Boy, the plate I told you to hold!"

1081
01:00:48,809 --> 01:00:50,603
"Mama, you said, 'Here.'"

1082
01:00:52,772 --> 01:00:54,941
"Boy, I said, 'Here, hold my plate.'"

1083
01:00:56,317 --> 01:00:57,568
"Mama... [whimpers]

1084
01:00:59,404 --> 01:01:00,738
Mama...

1085
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,242
Mama, you still love me, Mama?"

1086
01:01:06,202 --> 01:01:08,121
"Boy, what are you talking about?"

1087
01:01:08,204 --> 01:01:11,624
"You know how sometimes
I be doing stupid stuff, Mama?"

1088
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:14,585
"Oh, I know you didn't sit up there
and eat my food!

1089
01:01:14,669 --> 01:01:16,129
You get out of this car
and you walk to church.

1090
01:01:16,212 --> 01:01:18,506
You hear me?
You get out and you walk to church!

1091
01:01:18,589 --> 01:01:20,175
You got enough energy, get out of here!"

1092
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:22,385
[sputtering]

1093
01:01:22,468 --> 01:01:24,470
"Mama, I'm sorry!

1094
01:01:25,638 --> 01:01:28,058
I left you the biscuit, Mama!"

1095
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,063
I had to walk
all the way to church, y'all.

1096
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:34,981
I didn't care, I was full.

1097
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,569
I got in the back of the church,
my brother was back there.

1098
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:42,822
We were back there talking.
My brother was like, "You crazy."

1099
01:01:43,907 --> 01:01:47,327
I said, "You crazy.
Let Mama treat you like that."

1100
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:53,708
My brother's like,
"You gonna go to hell."

1101
01:01:54,709 --> 01:01:56,920
I said, "You already living in hell."

1102
01:02:00,048 --> 01:02:01,091
We back there talking

1103
01:02:01,174 --> 01:02:03,676
and my mama friend see us
and say... "Uh-uh."

1104
01:02:03,759 --> 01:02:07,180
Sister Russell saw us back there
talking, she went, "Uh-uh.

1105
01:02:07,263 --> 01:02:09,474
Back there embarrassing Sister Tucker.

1106
01:02:10,766 --> 01:02:13,019
They ought to be ashamed of theirselves.

1107
01:02:13,103 --> 01:02:14,938
Somebody get Sister Tucker.

1108
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:18,524
Touch Sister Tucker.

1109
01:02:20,235 --> 01:02:24,614
Mmm-mmm. Chris back there talking.
Mary! Mary! Mary! Mary! Hey!

1110
01:02:24,697 --> 01:02:27,242
Mary, look. Mary. Mary, look. Look, Mary."

1111
01:02:34,415 --> 01:02:35,666
[mouthing]

1112
01:02:37,377 --> 01:02:39,045
"He made it to church.

1113
01:02:39,129 --> 01:02:42,215
I thought somebody was gonna
kidnap him, you make me sick!

1114
01:02:43,591 --> 01:02:45,885
Back there talking! Chris!

1115
01:02:45,969 --> 01:02:47,678
Chris, shut up!

1116
01:02:48,763 --> 01:02:51,682
Shut up, boy! You hear me? Shut up!"

1117
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:53,101
And I knew she couldn't get up and move,

1118
01:02:53,184 --> 01:02:54,810
'cause it was the middle
of the church, so I said,

1119
01:02:54,894 --> 01:02:57,063
"Mama. You shut up, Mama."

1120
01:02:57,147 --> 01:02:58,231
[audience gasps]

1121
01:02:58,314 --> 01:02:59,732
My mama...

1122
01:03:03,403 --> 01:03:06,281
"Boy, are you done lost your mind, Chris?

1123
01:03:07,823 --> 01:03:10,160
Now, I said shut up, boy."

1124
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:12,953
"Mama, I said shut up, lady."

1125
01:03:18,334 --> 01:03:21,171
"You wait till after church,
you wait till after church, Chris."

1126
01:03:21,254 --> 01:03:24,299
"No, Mama, you wait
till after church, Mama.

1127
01:03:24,382 --> 01:03:26,926
You hear me?
You wait till after church, Mama!

1128
01:03:27,927 --> 01:03:30,346
Ain't gonna fix nobody no breakfast!"

1129
01:03:30,430 --> 01:03:32,640
"Boy, you done went crazy, boy!

1130
01:03:34,267 --> 01:03:36,894
-You, you wait--"
-"Mama, you wait, you wait."

1131
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:40,106
My mama so mad at me,
they thought she was shouting.

1132
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:42,608
She mad at me,
"Lord, I'm-a get him, Lord, I'm-a get him!

1133
01:03:52,827 --> 01:03:54,954
He ate my breakfast, Lord,
he ate my breakfast!"

1134
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,001
[chuckles]

1135
01:04:02,587 --> 01:04:04,964
I love church, man.
I love going to church.

1136
01:04:05,048 --> 01:04:06,799
It's fun in church.

1137
01:04:06,882 --> 01:04:10,053
I like to see the people
shouting in church.

1138
01:04:10,136 --> 01:04:11,637
Especially the older ladies
shouting in church.

1139
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:13,098
You know, the mothers?

1140
01:04:13,181 --> 01:04:15,475
'Cause the mothers,
they don't go to clubs no more,

1141
01:04:15,558 --> 01:04:19,187
so the only chance
they get to dance is in the church.

1142
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:20,813
So they be getting down.

1143
01:04:20,896 --> 01:04:23,316
They be sharp, too.
They be having their suits on with the--

1144
01:04:23,399 --> 01:04:25,651
Shiny, with the pretty hats
and they get to shoutin'.

1145
01:04:25,735 --> 01:04:27,862
They be getting down,
they be like, oh...

1146
01:04:44,462 --> 01:04:46,672
I be like, "Get down, Sister Scott."

1147
01:04:47,923 --> 01:04:49,259
Sometimes I go out there with them,

1148
01:04:49,342 --> 01:04:51,802
"Go ahead, Sister Scott.
Go ahead, Sister Scott!

1149
01:04:53,763 --> 01:04:56,056
You still got it, Sister Scott!"

1150
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,853
"I know I still got it, boy.
You gonna get in trouble, Chris.

1151
01:05:00,936 --> 01:05:02,147
Your mama looking at you, Chris.

1152
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:04,232
Your mama right over there.

1153
01:05:04,315 --> 01:05:07,527
1952, doing the romp here, baby.

1154
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:09,362
I ain't lost a step, look at that.

1155
01:05:10,405 --> 01:05:12,990
Your mama gonna get you, boy.
You crazy.

1156
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:16,452
I heard you ate her breakfast.
I don't know what's wrong with you.

1157
01:05:17,537 --> 01:05:19,455
What is wrong with you?"

1158
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,375
"How'd you hear about that?"

1159
01:05:26,129 --> 01:05:27,963
Man, mothers know everything.

1160
01:05:29,132 --> 01:05:31,134
It'd be scary sometimes in church.

1161
01:05:31,217 --> 01:05:33,886
You know the people that
run around in church scare everybody.

1162
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:35,721
They just bust out screaming...
[screams]

1163
01:05:38,933 --> 01:05:39,934
"Hallelujah!

1164
01:05:42,895 --> 01:05:44,397
Thank you, Lord!"

1165
01:05:49,735 --> 01:05:51,070
Even the pastor be scared.

1166
01:05:51,154 --> 01:05:52,780
"Who the hell was that?

1167
01:05:55,074 --> 01:05:57,076
There's a demon in the church.

1168
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:01,038
Go to my office and get my oil...

1169
01:06:02,498 --> 01:06:04,083
and a hot rag.

1170
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:09,129
I'm gonna get that demon
right up out of this church.

1171
01:06:09,214 --> 01:06:11,424
We not gonna have this in this church.

1172
01:06:12,675 --> 01:06:15,678
That ain't one of my members.
I know all my members.

1173
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:17,472
And ain't none of them that crazy."

1174
01:06:20,725 --> 01:06:22,768
Some preachers be a trip, don't they?

1175
01:06:22,852 --> 01:06:23,894
Some preachers be stingy.

1176
01:06:23,978 --> 01:06:26,105
You ever been to a church,
preacher's stingy?

1177
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:29,984
Preacher have a pitcher of lemonade
up on his pulpit,

1178
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:32,570
and two cups,
don't offer nobody nothing.

1179
01:06:33,779 --> 01:06:36,824
Talking about,
"Can I get an amen, church?"

1180
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:38,743
"Hey, man, pass some of that lemonade!

1181
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:41,996
You know it's hot in this church!

1182
01:06:42,913 --> 01:06:44,957
You know the water fountain don't work."

1183
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:48,586
-"Who said that?"
-"Me, the brother in the fifth row!

1184
01:06:50,004 --> 01:06:51,922
Hot as hell in this church!"

1185
01:06:52,882 --> 01:06:54,717
"Who the hell in the fifth row?"

1186
01:06:56,302 --> 01:06:58,554
Church be hot! You don't care.

1187
01:06:58,638 --> 01:07:00,306
Church be so hot the flies leave.

1188
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:03,434
"We going to a white church.
It's too hot in here.

Let's get the hell out of here, come on.

1190
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:06,396
[buzzes] Shit, the window closed.

1191
01:07:08,523 --> 01:07:10,525
Somebody open the window!

1192
01:07:11,859 --> 01:07:13,110
Oh, shit, man.

1193
01:07:14,028 --> 01:07:15,946
We don't want to be no member no more!

1194
01:07:17,197 --> 01:07:19,158
Come on, man!
Let's get the hell out of here.

1195
01:07:20,075 --> 01:07:21,661
Let us go!

1196
01:07:22,953 --> 01:07:24,580
Y'all, niggazz."

[chuckling]

1199
01:07:36,634 --> 01:07:38,218
Preacher be moving too fast
through the Bible,

1200
01:07:38,303 --> 01:07:39,595
he don't care nothing about this.

1201
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:41,472
He don't wait on nobody.

1202
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:43,724
"Now, turn to John 45.

1203
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,269
I'll wait for you."

1204
01:07:53,443 --> 01:07:55,152
You'll be looking for it.

1205
01:07:55,235 --> 01:07:58,448
"Hey, is John in the front of the Bible,
or the back of the Bible?

Hey, is John in the front of the Bible?

1207
01:08:03,411 --> 01:08:05,955
Something wrong with my Bible,
I think it's broken.

1208
01:08:06,872 --> 01:08:09,041
God bless you.
God is going to bless you.

1209
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,377
You mean like that."

1210
01:08:12,587 --> 01:08:14,547
Soon as you get to John,
"Go to Luke 45."

1211
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:16,299
"Pastor, slow down."

1212
01:08:18,426 --> 01:08:21,095
-"Who is that?"
-"Me, the brother in the fifth row!

1213
01:08:22,305 --> 01:08:25,015
Nobody don't know the Bible like you."

1214
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:27,267
"Who the hell is in the fifth row?"

"I don't know, some brother."

1216
01:08:32,607 --> 01:08:34,692
Then the preacher keep you there
all night long.

1217
01:08:34,775 --> 01:08:35,776
Then got the nerve to say,

1218
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,697
"I want you all to come back
for tonight's service.

1219
01:08:41,366 --> 01:08:45,119
It's gonna be a fine,
dandy time tonight."

1220
01:08:45,202 --> 01:08:46,662
I'm like, "Man, look outside,
it is tonight.

1221
01:08:46,746 --> 01:08:48,623
Look outside, it is tonight!

1222
01:08:50,124 --> 01:08:52,292
We done been here all damn day."

1223
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:55,671
"Who the hell is in the fifth row?

1224
01:08:56,756 --> 01:08:58,341
Get him out of here!

1225
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:02,637
Messing up my sermon."

1226
01:09:04,722 --> 01:09:06,098
Now I'm a father.

1227
01:09:06,181 --> 01:09:08,017
I'm a father now, I'm raising my son.

Go to Africa. Especially if you're black,
go see your ancestors.

1265
01:11:06,301 --> 01:11:08,220
I went to Africa, they took me out there,

1266
01:11:08,303 --> 01:11:10,389
I went out there for a genealogy thing.

1267
01:11:10,473 --> 01:11:13,017
I went out there to see my ancestors.

1268
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:14,894
They took me out there, I did this thing.

1269
01:11:14,977 --> 01:11:17,062
And they took me out there.
They took me way out in this village,

01:11:17,146 --> 01:11:19,607
on this dirt road,
all the way out to this village.

1271
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,442
They took me, and they showed me
and said, "These are your people."

look like me.

all the way out here in the desert."

I was about to leave, till one of them
reminded me of my Uncle John.

01:11:33,287 --> 01:11:34,539
He was like African Uncle John.
He's like,

1281
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:07,655
I said, "I don't know how the hell
you gonna pay for it neither, man.

1282
01:12:07,738 --> 01:12:10,700
Well, African Uncle John,
I already got an African Uncle John.

1283
01:12:10,783 --> 01:12:12,451
Now, I brought y'all some Coca-Colas
and some shoes

1284
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:14,203
and I ain't giving y'all nothin' else.

1285

Where's my Jeep?
Get me the hell out of this village!

Get me out of here!"

1287
01:12:22,419 --> 01:12:24,839
When you're a celebrity
and you go to Africa,

1288
01:12:24,922 --> 01:12:26,549
they do special stuff for you.

1289
01:12:26,632 --> 01:12:28,467
They have people
meet you at the airport.

1290
01:12:28,551 --> 01:12:31,011
They had a big band
meet at the airport for me.

1291
01:12:31,095 --> 01:12:34,306
They had drums, they had signs and stuff.

1292
01:12:34,389 --> 01:12:36,308

'cause it's a long way to Africa.

I got off the plane, I said,
"I'm gonna get some sleep."

I ran out of that hotel so fast,
I was like,

1359
01:15:19,263 --> 01:15:21,724
"Shit! That cheetah gonna kill us!"

1360
01:15:21,807 --> 01:15:23,642
And the cheetah was so fast,
it ran by me, I was like,

1361
01:15:23,726 --> 01:15:25,560
"Oh, shit, the cheetah!

1362
01:15:25,644 --> 01:15:26,937
Get my ass back in the hotel.

1363
01:15:27,021 --> 01:15:28,731
Close the doors of the hotel!

1364
01:15:30,274 --> 01:15:31,566
What the hell y'all got
the doors open for?

1365
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:33,944
You know cheetahs
are coming in here and shit."

1366
01:15:34,862 --> 01:15:37,447
-"It only happen once a year."
-"That's enough! Shit!

1367
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,912
Scared the hell out of me."

1368
01:15:44,872 --> 01:15:46,456
Africa is great.
I went on some great trips.

1369
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,793
I went to Africa one time
with Bill Clinton.

1370
01:15:48,876 --> 01:15:51,670
That was fun, we went to, like,
three or four countries in Africa,

1371
01:15:51,754 --> 01:15:53,380
and Clinton was great, man.

1372
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:56,842
We had so much fun.
We had so many places to go,

1373
01:15:56,926 --> 01:16:00,595
we started getting bored,
sometimes we just started playing games.

1374
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:02,556
I started doing impressions
of Bill Clinton

1375
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:04,767
and he started liking it.
He was like,

1376
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:07,686
[mimics Bill] "Oh, shit.
That sounds just like me. That sounds--

1377
01:16:09,188 --> 01:16:11,982
Oh, that sounds good, that sounds great.

1378
01:16:13,692 --> 01:16:15,152
I like that."

1379
01:16:17,863 --> 01:16:19,739
He invited me to Africa, man.
He invited me, he said,

1380
01:16:19,824 --> 01:16:22,827
"Tucker, you wanna go to Africa with me?
I think you'll like it.

1381
01:16:22,910 --> 01:16:25,329
You're black, I'm black.
I think you'll like it.

1382
01:16:28,498 --> 01:16:31,751
Come on.
It'll be fun, come on."

1383
01:16:32,711 --> 01:16:34,296
So I started doing impressions, man.

1384
01:16:34,379 --> 01:16:35,965
Everywhere we went,
he wanted me to do him.

1385
01:16:36,048 --> 01:16:37,341
We're at little parties at night...

1386
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:41,303
"Tucker, come, come do me.
Come do me. Come on over here."

1387
01:16:42,304 --> 01:16:43,347
Every country we went to.

1388
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:45,015
Finally, I got tired,
we got to Nigeria

1389
01:16:45,099 --> 01:16:47,601
and he wanted me to do it
in front of the president of Nigeria.

1390
01:16:47,684 --> 01:16:49,979
I was scared. Shit, if I mess it up,
they'd put me in jail.

1391
01:16:50,062 --> 01:16:51,897
I just said, "No, not now."

1392
01:16:51,981 --> 01:16:55,150
And he said, "Tucker!
Come on, come do me. Come do me.

1393
01:16:55,234 --> 01:16:56,360
Don't act like that, come on."

1394
01:16:56,443 --> 01:16:59,113
I said, "Mr. President, I'm tired,
it's been a long trip.

1395
01:16:59,196 --> 01:17:02,032
-Maybe I won't do it this time."
-"Tucker, come on now, I need you.

1396
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:04,326
I set it up now.
Come on, don't let me down.

1397
01:17:05,911 --> 01:17:07,537
You want a ride home, right, huh?

1398
01:17:09,414 --> 01:17:13,252
You wanna ride commercial or private?
You let me know, Tucker.

1399
01:17:13,335 --> 01:17:17,172
That's a long-ass flight home, Tucker,
that's a long flight."

1400
01:17:17,256 --> 01:17:18,798
[audience cheering]

1401
01:17:18,883 --> 01:17:20,759
Clinton got Barack elected!

1402
01:17:20,843 --> 01:17:21,886
Clinton came out there and said,

1403
01:17:21,969 --> 01:17:23,803
"I'm telling you right now,
I'm going to tell you the truth.

1404
01:17:23,888 --> 01:17:26,390
You ain't gonna like this,
I'm gonna tell you right now.

1405
01:17:26,473 --> 01:17:29,434
You won't be laughing after I say this."

1406
01:17:29,518 --> 01:17:31,311
And black people, we love Clinton

1407
01:17:31,395 --> 01:17:33,647
because Clinton knows how to
break it down, we'd just be listening,

1408
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:34,940
"God damn!"

1409
01:17:35,024 --> 01:17:36,901
We'll be listening like
he ain't supposed to be telling us.

1410
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:39,694
"Clinton, you ain't supposed
to be telling that shit.

1411
01:17:39,778 --> 01:17:40,946
We aren't supposed
to be hearing all this!"

1412
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:43,448
"No, I'm going to tell you
'cause you need to know!

1413
01:17:45,117 --> 01:17:47,870
These Republicans are crazy as hell!

1414
01:17:47,953 --> 01:17:50,789
They tried to put me out of office. Shit!

1415
01:17:50,873 --> 01:17:53,167
And the economy was up!

1416
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:56,753
They don't give a damn,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.

1417
01:17:58,797 --> 01:18:00,966
I'm not bullshitting you."

1418
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,342
[audience cheering]

1419
01:18:02,426 --> 01:18:03,427
He said...

1420
01:18:05,012 --> 01:18:06,931
[giggles]

1421
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:10,225
He said, "Now, listen, if you're black,
you should really hear this."

1422
01:18:12,352 --> 01:18:14,854
And black people were like,
"What? What is it?"

1423
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:17,983
"The Republicans are trying
to bring back slavery,

1424
01:18:18,067 --> 01:18:20,444
I swear to God!
I'm not lying to you!"

1425
01:18:20,527 --> 01:18:23,030
He know how to rattle us.
"What?"

1426
01:18:24,949 --> 01:18:28,160
"Vote for Barack,
I bullshit you not. Do it.

1427
01:18:29,453 --> 01:18:32,289
I told ya, I'm going to
break it down today.

1428
01:18:32,372 --> 01:18:34,041
I'm not gonna lie to you."

1429
01:18:35,084 --> 01:18:39,504
He did good for Barack. Barack was like,
"God damn, that was good. Shit.

1430
01:18:39,588 --> 01:18:42,257
Bill, that was a good-ass speech.

1431
01:18:42,341 --> 01:18:44,718
I thought you was
running for president, God damn.

1432
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:48,680
It was so good.
[chuckles]

1433
01:18:48,763 --> 01:18:51,308
You made it hard for me.
How the hell I'm-a follow that, Bill?"

1434
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,768
[mimicking Bill]
"Well, do what you gotta do, bro.

1435
01:18:57,356 --> 01:18:59,441
I told you I was going to set you up.

1436
01:19:01,068 --> 01:19:03,903
And that's what you wanted,
that's what you asked.

1437
01:19:03,988 --> 01:19:06,031
You wanted four more years,
you called on your boy Billy.

1438
01:19:06,115 --> 01:19:07,241
I'm gonna do it for you.

1439
01:19:07,324 --> 01:19:09,326
[audience cheering and applauding]

1440
01:19:10,369 --> 01:19:13,288
I'm gonna hook you up.
I'll do it right here.

1441
01:19:13,372 --> 01:19:15,749
If I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna do what I do.

1442
01:19:15,832 --> 01:19:17,626
I'm not gonna mess around with ya."

1443
01:19:18,793 --> 01:19:22,089
Barack was happy as hell.
He came out there, "Give me five, yeah.

1444
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:27,386
That's my boy, that's my boy right here.

1445
01:19:27,469 --> 01:19:29,471
That's my dawg, that's my dawg, right."

1446
01:19:31,098 --> 01:19:33,475
But Barack knew he was gonna get
back in office when he got Bin Laden.

1447
01:19:33,558 --> 01:19:35,602
Remember when he got Bin Laden?
He knew it!

1448
01:19:35,685 --> 01:19:38,522
He came out there, man, he was ready!

1449
01:19:38,605 --> 01:19:41,191
He was in front of the White House lawn,
he was ready.

1450
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:43,110
He said,
"No, no. I got this. I got this.

1451
01:19:46,071 --> 01:19:49,491
Uh, America, la-di-da-di,
we got Bin Laden.

1452
01:19:53,453 --> 01:19:55,205
Got his ass. We got him.

1453
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:58,000
We got him yesterday
in Pakistan, 0400 hours,

1454
01:19:58,083 --> 01:20:00,085
I sent the SEAL team
over there to get him.

1455
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:01,836
Matter of fact, I went with 'em.

1456
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:07,259
And I saw him. I said, 'Look, there he is,
right there, look at him.

1457
01:20:09,469 --> 01:20:13,640
In the window, fixin' breakfast and shit,
like he ain't did nothing, look at him.'

1458
01:20:13,723 --> 01:20:15,475
I said, 'Give me the gun.
I'll get him, I'm the president.

1459
01:20:15,559 --> 01:20:16,726
Shit, I'll go get him.'

1460
01:20:17,519 --> 01:20:20,272
So I went in and busted in there,
I said, 'Bin Laden, la-di-da-di, bitch!

1461
01:20:20,355 --> 01:20:22,982
[imitating machine gun]

Let's get the hell out of here, come on.

1463
01:20:24,443 --> 01:20:28,072
Let's get on the plane. I got some chicken
on this plane, come on, let's go.

1464
01:20:29,656 --> 01:20:32,034
Let's get the hell out of here.

1465
01:20:32,117 --> 01:20:34,119
Thought we forgot. Shit, no.'"

1466
01:20:35,995 --> 01:20:37,622
Barack couldn't believe
he won the first time,

1467
01:20:37,706 --> 01:20:38,707
remember he won the first time?

1468
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:40,625
He was like,
"God damn, I won? Shit!

1469
01:20:42,836 --> 01:20:47,174
Oh, shit! I was just playing,
God damn. What?

01:20:48,467 --> 01:20:50,552
What the hell? Shit.

I was just bullshitting."

1472
01:20:55,182 --> 01:20:56,891
-"Mr. President, come this way."
-"Who you talking to?"

1473
01:20:56,975 --> 01:20:58,893
-"You."
-"Oh, shit, I'm sorry.

1474
01:20:58,977 --> 01:21:01,271
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Shit.

1475
01:21:01,355 --> 01:21:03,523
God damn, I gotta get this in my head.

1476
01:21:03,607 --> 01:21:05,067
God damn, I was--

1477
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:07,569
I just wanted to find
something to do, God damn.

1478
01:21:08,612 --> 01:21:10,114
How am I gettin' around?"

1479
01:21:10,197 --> 01:21:11,573
"Air Force One is right over there, sir."

01:21:11,656 --> 01:21:13,617
"God damn, I got a plane? Shit!

1481

Look at this! Sasha, Malia,
go sit in captain's seat.

1483
01:21:21,416 --> 01:21:23,960
That's your daddy's plane.
Go on up there.

1484
01:21:24,043 --> 01:21:27,464
I got a goddamn plane
for wherever the hell we wanna go."

1485
01:21:27,547 --> 01:21:30,259
I love his walk.
Barack even got that little African walk.

1486
01:21:32,344 --> 01:21:34,763
African-American, African walk.

1487
01:21:34,846 --> 01:21:37,599
He'll be walkin' and drums be going off.

1489
01:21:55,074 --> 01:21:57,244
Barack ain't gonna put up with
reporters yelling out no more,

1490
01:21:57,327 --> 01:21:58,453
he ain't gonna put up with that.

1491
01:21:58,537 --> 01:22:00,164
He was doing the first year,

1492
01:22:00,247 --> 01:22:02,582
they would say,
"Mr. President, you're a liar!"

1493
01:22:02,666 --> 01:22:06,378
Barack was like, "Who said that shit?
Who said that? Who said that?

1494
01:22:06,461 --> 01:22:09,923
Come down and slap the hell out of you,
who said that shit?

1495
01:22:10,006 --> 01:22:12,592
Don't talk to me like that,
I'm President of the United States. Shit.

I'm from South Side, Chicago.
I'll come down and whoop that ass.

Come on, not this term, not this term.

1498

I put up with that last term,
not this year.

Not now.
Not no more, I swear.

You're talking to Barry here,
God damn it. Barry!"

1501
01:22:30,152 --> 01:22:31,361
Reporters are a trip, man.

1502
01:22:31,445 --> 01:22:34,113
These reporters be all over the place,
man, they be...

1503
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:36,575
