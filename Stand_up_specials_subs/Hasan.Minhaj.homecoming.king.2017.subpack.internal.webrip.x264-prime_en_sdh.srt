00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,475
[theme music: orchestral hip-hop]

2
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,239
[crowd roars]

3
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,740
What's up?

4
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,410
Davis, what's up?

5
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,496
I'm home.

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,457
I had to bring it back here.

7
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,878
Netflix said, "Where do you want
to do the special? LA, Chicago, New York?"

8
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,381
I was like, "Nah, son. Davis California."

9
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:51,093
[cheering, whooping]

10
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,719
This has, um...

11
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,889
This has been a very good year for me.

12
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,933
I recently got married, you guys.

13
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,726
Thank you, thank you.

14
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,895
Thank you. I need the claps.

15
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,106
It's a very heavy ring. Very heavy.

16
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,650
It was a reverse
<i>Lord of the Rings </i>situation.

17
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,819
I got a ring and then lost my powers,

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,488
which is a very different
<i>Lord of the Rings</i>.

19
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,865
"Listening? Compromise?
Take the ring, Sam."

20
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:18,787
The movie is done in eight minutes.
It's not a 90-hour saga.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,331
We just celebrated
our one-year anniversary,

22
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,126
so it's one year down, forever to go.

23
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:27,713
Which is terrifying to say.

24
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,216
But you know what's great?
Now, it's just kind of liberating.

25
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,762
Because I don't give a fuck
about any of my single friends.

26
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,683
I don't care about any of you
and it feels great.

27
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,270
Because you guys are at home,
just swiping for love,

28
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,813
and complaining.

29
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,565
"Oh, how do you find people?"

30
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,152
"Dimples? Off with his head!"
Like a god-damn emperor.

31
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,903
"Brunettes? Not for me."

32
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,157
I'm like, "You work at Subway.
You don't deserve so much choice."

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,950
We're getting soft.

34
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,787
You realize my parents
physically never saw each other?

35
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:04,458
Thirty years ago in a town in India,
population 990,000 -

36
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,751
that's a small town -

37
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:10,047
my dad heard a buzz in the streets
about this woman named Seema, my mom.

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,550
And, like,
Seema was that chick, you guys.

39
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,677
In '82, Seema could get...

40
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,263
Look at that red <i>langa</i>. Killing it!

41
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,642
She was like the iPhone 8.

42
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:25,479
"Have you heard of Seema?
She's slim. Her family owns a camera."

43
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,689
My dad was like, "A camera?"

44
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:31,068
So he runs to my grandfather's house
and lays it on the line.

45
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,154
"I'm going to America.
I want to marry Seema. YOLO."

46
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:39,326
In ten minutes, the man married a woman
he had never laid eyes on.

47
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,746
You understand?
That's Tinder with no photos.

48
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,914
[laughter]

49
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,375
"I want that for the rest of my life.

50
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,543
I hope she has a good personality.

51
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,464
Let's move to the US where we're
the only people that know each other."

52
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,384
I'm so grateful for that decision.

53
00:02:55,842 --> 00:03:00,013
Najmi marries Question Mark,
they come to the States, I come out.

54
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:04,434
Popping out of your mom is like
real estate. It's all about location.

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,313
I popped out here. Anybody brown,
we popped out here, we made it.

56
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:10,941
We're the rappers that made it.

57
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:18,198
What's wild is, I never even knew how
the whole <i>X-Men Origins </i>story went down.

58
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,369
It's crazy, because we know
nothing about our parents

59
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,329
and our parents know nothing about us.

60
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,832
"Dad, your favorite color?" "Stanford!"

61
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,208
"What? No."

62
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:34,131
"No, I want to know more about you."
"Why? Get into Stanford."

63
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,885
And I think it's just that, like,
immigrants love secrets.

64
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,555
Right? They love them.

65
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,141
They love bottling them up deep down,

66
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,310
and unleashing them on you later
when it's no longer relevant.

67
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,898
"Mom's a ninja, Dad's a communist?
Why are you telling me this right now?"

68
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,445
Every conversation with my dad
is like an M. Night Shyamalan movie.

69
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,990
It's just 90 minutes of build-up
to no payoff.

70
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,992
[laughs and applause]

71
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,243
"That's the ending?"

72
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:07,539
So my dad marries my mom,
they come to the States, they have me,

73
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,458
in Davis, California,

74
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:13,086
but my mom has to go back to India
to finish up med school.

75
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:16,047
So the first eight years,
it was just me and my dad.

76
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,800
Just the two of us trying
to make it in America.

77
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,052
Minus all the unconditional love.

78
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,306
Brown love is very conditional.

79
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,768
In the photo he's like,
"You had better get all As."

80
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,438
Like, let's be real.

81
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:35,776
I grew up here. Like, Pioneer...
I grew up here.

82
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,693
Yeah.

83
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,153
[huge cheer]

84
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,031
But Davis was, like, super white.

85
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,908
Kind of like tonight.

86
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,285
[laughter]

87
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,830
Roll call was a problem.
It was a big deal for a lot of us.

88
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,875
- Like, what's your name?
- Jasura.

89
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,794
Okay. What would you get?

90
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,338
- Jasuriah.
- Jasuriah?

91
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,132
Yeah. I would get, like,
"Hanson Minaja..."

92
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,301
"Sahan Minha."

93
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,845
"Saddam Hussein."

94
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,097
It was my English teacher.
"I'm not Saddam."

95
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,557
- What's your name?
- Biju.

96
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,559
- What would you get?
- A blank stare.

97
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,977
A blank stare?

98
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,399
I'm the only brown kid at school,
Dad is the only brown guy at work.

99
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:20,904
In a weird way that brings us together,
and we have to do everything together.

100
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,367
Try to understand immigrant fathers.
I still can't understand some of you.

101
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,994
There are uncles here.
None of you guys are smiling.

102
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,413
I don't get it.
You're going to die. Laugh.

103
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,457
Why aren't you laughing?

104
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,918
You're always stressed and always tired.

105
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,673
You could wake up any immigrant father
from a 12-hour nap, and they'd say...

106
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,049
[angry yawn]

107
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,135
"Why do I have to pay taxes?"

108
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,971
You're like, "Jesus..."

109
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:50,350
We'd do everything...
I remember being in the grocery store.

110
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,937
And we'd be walking through the aisles,
and my dad would pick up yogurt.

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,356
"Ah, yogurt."

112
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,027
Or milk. Just like, "Ah."

113
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,450
And I'd look at him and be like,
"Oh, man. Dad hates yogurt."

114
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,119
[laughter]

115
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,954
"He hates milk."

116
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,790
But I get that look, now.

117
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,876
Life is tough and sometimes
you don't know what you're doing.

118
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,589
He has a little kid
and I'm not making his life any easier.

119
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,924
I'm picking up soda and I'm like, "Ah!"

120
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,427
"Don't do that."
"I'm going to live forever!"

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,096
Then I would trip on my Velcro shoes

122
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,057
and I would drop the soda
and it would explode.

123
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,477
And then my dad would do
what most brown parents do.

124
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,439
He would check
to see if the coast is clear...

125
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,568
and he'd slap the shit out of me.

126
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,986
[laughter]

127
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,322
I love it. Thank you. Thank you.

128
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,907
Pockets were acknowledging that.

129
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,868
And for the liberal white guilt,

130
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,246
immigrants aren't going to hit
their children the way you do.

131
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,874
Americans hit on the arm
and bruise the body.

132
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,668
Immigrants slap your face
and bruise your soul.

133
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,087
It's Guantanamo of the mind.

134
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,259
And I know some of you guys are like,
"Hey, this is Davis, okay?

135
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,596
I listen to NPR. Ira Glass says
children are our future."

136
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,266
Have you seen the show called <i>The Slap</i>?
This is a real show on NBC.

137
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,355
This is a real show about a white kid
that gets slapped at a birthday party.

138
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,148
Are you fucking kidding?

139
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,902
Thirteen episodes for this kid?
Are you kidding me?

140
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,448
Do you know when brown kids get slapped?
Every brown birthday party.

141
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,993
And usually it's the kid
whose birthday it is,

142
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,579
and we stand there and point and laugh.

143
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,874
We go, "Ah,
Biju got slapped on his birthday!"

144
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,419
And that's what makes us
tough and resilient.

145
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,881
It's why we become cardiologists
and win spelling bees.

146
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,218
Slapping is important.
It elevates your game.

147
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,222
You ever seen an Indian kid
win a spelling bee?

148
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,848
Incredible!

149
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,394
Ice water in the veins.

150
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,895
[laughter]

151
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,982
That kid won't choke on camera.
He's been slapped on camera.

152
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,859
- Of course he can spell "knaidel".
- <i>Knaidel.</i>

153
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,697
Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing!

154
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,950
He's 12 years old. Nothing!

155
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,579
This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing.

156
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:22,252
People ask, "Where does that come from?"
Look at this kid's parents.

157
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,423
Your son just won
the Scripps National Spelling Bee.

158
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,302
Look at his brother. His brother is like,
"I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

159
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,930
The bar is way too high.
I should kill myself."

160
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,099
People say, "Where's Bobby Jindal from?"

161
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,144
That's where he comes from.
That is an Indian sociopath.

162
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,855
[raucous laughter]

163
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,274
I know what happens
when I talk about this.

164
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,943
People say, "Your parents don't love you."

165
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,487
I think our parents love us.
We have great fathers.

166
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:53,867
I just think our fathers didn't download
all the great dad software.

167
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,995
There are just a few apps missing.

168
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,873
Birthdays aren't their thing.

169
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:04,169
Every immigrant father feels like
if they brought you to the US...

170
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,297
Happy Birthday.

171
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,216
Starbucks, Wi-Fi, freeways,
happy birthday.

172
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,677
No more birthdays. Go be president.

173
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,514
At an interview, this lady said,
"Describe your earliest birthday memory."

174
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:18,516
I was like, "Do I have to?"

175
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,602
So I'm six, I'm turning seven.

176
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,313
My dad wakes me up
super early in the morning.

177
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:24,856
"Hasan, get up!

178
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,274
Get in the Camry."

179
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,443
The immigrant car of choice.

180
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,489
We get in the Camry, we're driving
from Davis to Sacramento.

181
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,116
There's one mall in the entire area.
Arden.

182
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,785
We get to this intersection,

183
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,454
and I look to my left,

184
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,082
and it's the one place
every kid dreams about.

185
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,792
Toys 'R' Us.

186
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,919
I was like, "Oh, shit!

187
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,713
Dad saw the Toys 'R' Us catalog
on my wall.

188
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,674
He saw my vision board.

189
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,638
He saw the blue BMX bike I wanted.
He's here to surprise me.

190
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,808
Turn left. Turn left.

191
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,477
Turn... left."

192
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,271
Then he turns right,

193
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,524
and I'm like, "Home Depot?

194
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,193
No!"

195
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,613
I'm like, "Why are we here?
Do you know what day it is?"

196
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,739
"It's Saturday."

197
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,575
"No, it's my birthday. Did you forget?"

198
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,912
He's like, "Hasan, how could I forget
that it's your birthday?

199
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,706
That's why I brought you here.

200
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,127
So you could pick the door handle
for the bathroom."

201
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,711
[laughter]

202
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:34,300
And I was like, "Why don't you
have me pick out the toilet?

203
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,177
You are shitting on my dreams."

204
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,140
I didn't say that. I would have gotten
a slap. I wanted to say that.

205
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,349
That's when I realized

206
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,144
there's a generational gap
between us and our parents.

207
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,479
You're going to fight with your parents,

208
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,566
and there's a finite number
of hands you can play.

209
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,067
You know about this.

210
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,528
Not going to be a doctor?
That's a hand.

211
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,740
Marry a white girl?
Boom! That's a big hand.

212
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,367
[laughter, applause]

213
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,079
I could have been like,
"Dad, fight me. I want that bike."

214
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,666
But I was like, "Hang on to your cards.
You'll need them later."

215
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,085
Like, I had vision as a six-year-old.

216
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:14,048
And my mom, she would come and visit,
and just kill the mom game.

217
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:18,678
One year, she came to school and
brought me a <i>Ghostbusters </i>proton pack.

218
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,140
The wheelie thing, the backpack,
the gun that catches ghosts...

219
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,309
Literally shut Pioneer down.

220
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,980
Kids were losing their minds. "What?
Saddam Hussein's a Ghostbuster?"

221
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,317
"Yeah, I'm a brown Ghostbuster.
Deal with it."

222
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,360
One of the happiest days of my life.

223
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,323
But then she would go back to India.

224
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,742
That's when I realized I don't want a toy.

225
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,369
I just want my mom. I want to be a family.

226
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,873
I was very emo. I was like Drake.
I missed that girl.

227
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,209
"When is she coming back?
I need her in my life.

228
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,381
I need her. I need that girl.

229
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,800
I need that girl in my life.

230
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,553
I need her, Dad.
She used to call me on my phone."

231
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,222
My dad's like,
"When the visa comes through."

232
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,850
"When the visa comes through."
It's a big deal.

233
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:09,812
I don't care what anyone says.
It's difficult to get in this country.

234
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,690
It's not like a broken condom
where you're like, "I'm in!"

235
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,774
[laughter]

236
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,568
Eight years.

237
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,780
August 11th, 1993. I'm so excited.

238
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,533
I put on my <i>Ghostbusters </i>proton pack.
I'm standing there.

239
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,494
Dad goes, "Put on Indian clothes."

240
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,578
I'm like, "Alright.

241
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,747
I can be an Indian ghostbuster."

242
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,251
I put on a <i>Salwar Kameez</i>.
I'm standing there.

243
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,963
Door opens.

244
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,756
Dad walks through.

245
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,258
Mom walks through.

246
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,011
And then immediately behind my mom,

247
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,306
is this little brown girl
with a mushroom cut.

248
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,184
She runs up to me and hugs me.

249
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,811
"Hasan<i> bhai</i>!"

250
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,439
And I'm in full hover-hands mode,

251
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,984
because I have no idea who this person is.

252
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,403
What happened was,

253
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,612
my dad

254
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,365
would go back and forth to India
to visit my mom,

255
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,618
and during one trip he knocked her up.

256
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,328
[shocked laughter]

257
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,955
And I had a sister.

258
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,251
But no one told me about it.

259
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,878
[uproarious laughter]

260
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:21,050
Remember how I told you
that immigrants love secrets?

261
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,302
This is a secret that nobody told me!

262
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,554
He says, "Hug her."

263
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,056
"You brought her out
like <i>Maury </i>for immigrants."

264
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,435
"Hasan, you are the brother."
I'm like, "No, no!"

265
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,646
She was breakdancing,
and I'm like, "Who the fuck are you?"

266
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,024
"You don't know me?"
"I've no idea who you are."

267
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,693
I hated that brown girl so much.

268
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,362
I was like, "Build that wall."

269
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:44,907
I was like a little Republican.
I was like, "I get it."

270
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,368
I remember leveling with my parents
at dinner.

271
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,537
"Look, Mom, Dad, let's just be real.

272
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,290
Oh, my God, these brown people...
Oh, jeez.

273
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,168
Coming into our house...

274
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,880
eating our Fruit Roll-Ups...

275
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,175
they don't speak the language...

276
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,803
I say we tell them to go back
where they came from."

277
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:08,556
He's like, "You can't say that.
We're family."

278
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,767
I'm like, "No, that's on you and Mom.

279
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,437
You guys decided to get
your Angelina Jolie on,

280
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,147
and bring over this FOB.

281
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,107
That's on you, that's not on me."

282
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,651
Why do you do this to your daughters?

283
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:25,448
Every single brown mother makes your
daughter <i>quinceañera </i>dress, chop cuts.

284
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,077
Why? Princess from here down,
Toad from here up.

285
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,164
I've got this shit following me around
on the playground. "Hasan <i>bhai</i>!"

286
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,707
I'm like, "Yo, kick rocks!"

287
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:37,543
I go play tetherball. "Hasan <i>bhai</i>!"
"Get lost!"

288
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,714
Eventually, I run to the boys' bathroom.
She follows me into the bathroom.

289
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:42,799
"Hasan<i> bhai</i>!"

290
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,176
All the kids at the urinal are like, "Uh!

291
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,178
What's <i>Hasan-bye</i>?"

292
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,849
I went to school with a bunch
of Ryan Lochtes. Just all traps.

293
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,645
[slow, stupid voice] "Uh, I don't
understand other cultures, bro.

294
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,355
What is that? What does it mean?"

295
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,358
It's a term of endearment in my culture,
meaning "brother".

296
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,484
"Shut up, Cody!"

297
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,070
I took that anger and channeled it at her.

298
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,279
I was like, "Hey!

299
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,198
You're not my sister."

300
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,866
[gasps in audience]

301
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,868
But she couldn't understand English.

302
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:14,664
[laughter, applause]

303
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,499
But she got what I was saying.

304
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,918
She starts crying and runs out.

305
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,503
I was like, "No!

306
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,131
She's going to tell Dad."

307
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,301
Let's focus on what's important here.

308
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,428
But she didn't.

309
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,971
And my dad...

310
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,349
It was her first birthday in the US.
She was turning five.

311
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,853
So for her first birthday,
he wanted it to be special.

312
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
I can imagine being a father,

313
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,567
missing your daughter's first steps,
her first time saying "Dada..."

314
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,985
That's a hard thing.

315
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,071
So for her birthday,
he brings everyone into the living room.

316
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,616
He drags in this big box
and goes, "Aisha, open the box."

317
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,369
She cuts open the box
and unfurls one of the flaps,

318
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:57,665
and I see "Toys 'R' Us"
emblazoned on one of the flaps.

319
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,376
And he reaches in,

320
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,880
and pulls out a beautiful, blue BMX bike.

321
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,298
[audience gasps]

322
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,010
"Here you go, Aisha." He looks at me.
"Happy Birthday."

323
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:12,346
[shocked laughter, booing]

324
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,476
Savage, right?

325
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,105
I'm livid. I'm like, "Yo, when did
Home Depot Dad become Danny Tanner?

326
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,065
This is bullshit. Really?"

327
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,066
I'm livid.

328
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,654
And Aisha senses it. She's like,
"Hasan <i>bhai</i>, why don't you take it out?"

329
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,408
And as an elder brother,
I felt entitled to that bike.

330
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,076
"That's my bike. Thank you."

331
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,456
Younger siblings, you guys are worthless.
You bring nothing to the table.

332
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,168
I see you getting mad.
"Hell, no. I have a personality."

333
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,129
Where do you think
you got that from, dummy? Us.

334
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,256
Clothes, culture, money.

335
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,468
"Whoa! I have opinions."
No, you don't.

336
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:53,471
And then you have the audacity
to be, like,

337
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,515
"Hey, why are you so melodramatic?"

338
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:59,310
Because I went to war for you.
Mom and Dad was my Vietnam.

339
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,562
And you're like, "Everybody loves me."

340
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,231
It's such bullshit, right?

341
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,359
Elder siblings,
we walk through the world like,

342
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,902
"Do people love me?"

343
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:11,405
And you're like, "Mom and Dad
fucked up with you, not with me."

344
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:13,866
[shocked laughter]

345
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,328
She's like, "Take it for one lap
around the block."

346
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,205
[speaking Hindi]

347
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,333
I grab those handlebars,
I'm like, "Fuck that noise."

348
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,711
Boom. I take off.
She's like, "Hasan <i>bhai</i>, come back!"

349
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:28,589
I'm like, "Eat my dust, immigrant."
I'm flying.

350
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,342
I see a curb. I'm about to pop a wheelie.

351
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,094
The bike goes left, I go right.

352
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,429
And that beautiful blue BMX bike...

353
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,391
Bam! It crashes into the cement.

354
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,686
All the paint is chipped off
the right side of the bike.

355
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,479
I pick it up,

356
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,773
and it's destroyed.

357
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,858
I hear the patter of her chappals.

358
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,945
She's crying,
"Hasan <i>bhai</i>, why would you do this?"

359
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,322
Animé tears of innocence.

360
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,075
"Why? I gave you the first ride."

361
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,619
And I'm looking down at her,

362
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,454
and I'm like, "Man...

363
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,999
I'm being a dick."

364
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,002
Like, this whole time

365
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,463
I was looking for acceptance
from Cody, Corey and Cole...

366
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:13,426
[laughter]

367
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,137
and I had it right here
this entire time.

368
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,180
I'm supposed to be her big brother,

369
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,350
help her navigate the American dream
and protect her.

370
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:25,104
And I'm out here stealing her bike?
This is fucked up.

371
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,481
And Aisha hates that story.

372
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:32,153
She's always like, "Oh, my God,
you are so melodramatic.

373
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,197
You make me sound like a refugee baby."

374
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:38,200
That's true. I'm doing that right now.

375
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,245
It's not fair,
because she's not a refugee.

376
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,789
And, like, she learned English.

377
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,794
She went to an Ivy League law school.
She does mergers and acquisitions now.

378
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,838
She is the one percent.

379
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,548
Meanwhile, I...

380
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,384
I didn't go to grad school.

381
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,762
I became a comedian. This is what I do.

382
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:02,016
And then, when it came time
for me to get married,

383
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,061
I got married to a girl
from a Hindu family.

384
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,564
I heard an audible "Oh!" Alright.

385
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:12,109
Fuck. I heard you go, like, "Ugh!"
I didn't punch you.

386
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,820
Damn!

387
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,656
So some of you guys don't know.

388
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:20,326
Hindus and Muslims are like
the Montagues and Capulets of India.

389
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,453
We've been warring for centuries.

390
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,373
You're like, "What's the difference?
You look the same."

391
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,084
So how do I explain this?
Hindus and Muslims.

392
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,252
So Hindus...

393
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,548
Hindus don't eat beef.
"No beef!" Right?

394
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:38,469
And Muslims, we don't eat pork.
"Is that pepperoni pizza? No.

395
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:40,471
No pepperoni!"

396
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,182
And then Hindus, they like statues.

397
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:47,520
They're like, "Oh!
This is a statue of an elephant.

398
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,106
I'm going to put this in my car."

399
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,693
[laughter, applause]

400
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,951
Muslims are like, "No statues!
Calligraphy! We're about the alphabet.

401
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,705
We put that in our car.
We're different."

402
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,457
And then Hindus, they like cartoons.

403
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,002
They're like,
"Oh, this is a cartoon Ganesh.

404
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,422
I'll just put this on the wall."

405
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,590
And Muslims...

406
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:21,303
we don't really, uh, like cartoons.

407
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,223
We've got to get better
about our cartoon policy.

408
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,518
Because of this we've been killing
each other for centuries.

409
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,896
And I know the older generation
doesn't like those jokes.

410
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,649
"Pakistan was created
because of this reason."

411
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,234
I know, but...

412
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,486
I convinced my dad.

413
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,613
"Dad, I love her, she loves me.

414
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,574
Isn't there something bigger

415
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,077
that unites all of us
outside of race, color, creed, class?

416
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:49,415
This is America. We can choose what
we want to adhere from the motherland.

417
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,461
Isn't life like <i>biryani</i>, where you push
the weird shit to the side?

418
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:57,089
Why do we got to adhere
to this weird shit from back over there?

419
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,215
He agrees.

420
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,884
He's like, "That's a good point.

421
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,386
Fine. You should get married."

422
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,347
That's a Hall of Fame brown dad decision.

423
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,309
There's brown dads here, like,
"If my son did that,

424
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,895
I would shoot myself and then shoot him."

425
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,646
He says yes.

426
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,649
We rally the troops,
Me, Mom, Dad, Aisha,

427
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,986
we get in the Camry,
we're driving to my fiancée's house.

428
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:22,281
And we're about to pull up
and we get to the door,

429
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,451
and my dad is about to ring the doorbell,

430
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,328
when he says the sentence

431
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:30,581
that is the killer
of every brown kid's dream.

432
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,626
He goes,

433
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,962
"I don't think we should do this.

434
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,799
<i>Log kya kahenge</i>?

435
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,467
[audience gasps]

436
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,260
"What will people think?"

437
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,180
I don't know if you know,

438
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:49,391
but every time a brown father
says <i>log kya kahenge</i>,

439
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,477
a star actually falls from the sky.

440
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,770
[laughter]

441
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,272
"I don't want to be a doctor!"
<i>"Log kya kahenge!</i>"

442
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,816
No!

443
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,027
"I don't want to marry!"
<i>"Log kya kahenge!</i>"

444
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,737
Why?

445
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,532
I bet you,
when Mahatma Gandhi told his parents

446
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:07,159
he was going to liberate India,

447
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:10,079
even they were like, "<i>Log kya kahenge!</i>

448
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,791
"Stop marching. The British
are going to talk shit about us.

449
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:17,336
Why are you bald and skinny?
You're never going to get married."

450
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,046
And I'm standing there...

451
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,882
on that doorstep.

452
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,551
[applause, cheering]

453
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:25,844
Wait, I'm standing there...

454
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,597
on that doorstep,

455
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:32,226
like, "Wait, you want me to change my life
because of <i>log kya kahenge</i>?

456
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,228
Come on, Dad.

457
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,481
How many times do we complain
about racism in our community?

458
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:38,566
All the time.

459
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,902
Now the ball is in our court,
we're going to be bigoted?

460
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:45,114
Dad, I promise you,
God doesn't like bigotry.

461
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,866
God's not like, 'You're racist. Good job.'

462
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,951
No!

463
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,787
Number two, you want me
to change my life

464
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,790
to appease some aunty and uncle
I'm never going to see?

465
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,669
You want me to change my life
for Naila Aunty? Fuck Naila Aunty.

466
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,421
Are you fucking kidding me?

467
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,256
My life?"

468
00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:05,593
But I can't say that.

469
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:10,264
Because I've played all my cards.
So I can't say anything.

470
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,685
Now I'm losing hope.
I'm, like, "Maybe this is bigger than me.

471
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,355
Why can't I put my head down
and do what I'm supposed to do?

472
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,274
This ain't <i>Jodhaa Akbar</i>."

473
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,652
Have you ever been trapped
by the time you live in?

474
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,196
It's been going on for centuries.

475
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,324
So I'm walking back to the Camry,

476
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,284
then I hear a voice behind me.

477
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,202
"Oh, my God.

478
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:37,082
You guys do this all the time."

479
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,169
And it is Aisha, and she is pissed.

480
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,755
And she's like, "Dad,

481
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,300
I did not fly out from Philly for this."

482
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,385
[laughter]

483
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,764
"Beena is so legit.

484
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,807
She has a PhD.

485
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,226
Hasan <i>bhai </i>is a comedian."

486
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,856
[laughter, applause, whooping]

487
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:04,193
"No one is going to marry him.

488
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,279
Get him married
before she changes her mind."

489
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,949
She stepped up.
She laid down one of her cards for me.

490
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:15,329
She Phil Jacksoned that situation.
She got all these people working together.

491
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,248
Because of her,
I got to marry the love of my life.

492
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:21,126
Because of my sister. I can't believe it.

493
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,546
[rapturous applause]

494
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,925
For years I resented that brown girl.
I hated her.

495
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,428
But on that day, on that special day,

496
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,264
I couldn't have been more proud
to be her Hasan <i>bhai</i>.

497
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,561
[applause, whistling]

498
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,525
[whooping]

499
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,988
[huge applause]

500
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:53,951
[applause fades]

501
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,870
You know, they say

502
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:01,166
every generation is defined
by a great struggle or tragedy.

503
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,837
And it's wild
that our kids will never know

504
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,589
there was a period in time in this country

505
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,633
where you had to make a choice

506
00:25:09,717 --> 00:25:12,761
between being on the internet
or being on the phone.

507
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,347
[laughter]

508
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,434
They won't get it, dude.
You'll never get it.

509
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,521
You don't get it, man. You won't.
That was our World War I, man.

510
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,858
Especially in middle school,
if a girl called the house,

511
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:28,694
you had to pick up the phone
before your parents.

512
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:34,283
We used to have landlines.
It's like phones connected to the land.

513
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,411
And one time in middle school
a girl called the house.

514
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,329
My dad picked it up before me.

515
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,706
"Hello, who is this?"

516
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,126
"Hi, it's Alice. Is Hasan there?"
"What you want, Alice?"

517
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,378
I was like, "I'm going to die a virgin."

518
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,549
"I'm in Geometry with Hasan.
I had a question.

519
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,426
Can I ask him the question?"

520
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,470
He's like, "Okay, Alice.

521
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,764
Why don't you ask me the question,

522
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,684
then I'll ask Hasan?"

523
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,895
That's the way our parents are.

524
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:07,149
Ages zero through 30, "No girls!"
At 35, "Why can't you talk to girls?"

525
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,693
That's basically it. "Ah, you kill me!"

526
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,445
[applause, whooping]

527
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,906
That's the way our parents are, right?

528
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,076
Our parents are like a firewall
to the outside world.

529
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,914
They disseminate information to us.
It's like living in North Korea.

530
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,459
My dad is the leader of the household.

531
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,170
So when 9-11 happened
I was in high school.

532
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:30,172
My dad sits everybody down.

533
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,424
He's like, "Hasan, whatever you do,

534
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:35,677
do not tell people you're Muslim
or talk about politics."

535
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:40,057
"Alright, Dad, I'll just hide it.
This just rubs off."

536
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,351
We're sitting there. Phone rings.

537
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,145
I run, but my dad beats me to the phone.

538
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,439
"Hello?" I grab the second phone.

539
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:50,692
I hear a voice. "Hey, you sand nigger,
where's Osama?"

540
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,236
[audience gasps]

541
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,529
He looks at me.

542
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,908
"You can hear me, right?
You fucking dune coon. Where's Osama?"

543
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,998
"Hey, 2631 Regatta Lane,
that's where you live, right?

544
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,334
I'm going to fucking kill you."
Click.

545
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,462
And my dad's looking at me.

546
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:15,884
Do you ever see your parents,
and you see the mortality in them?

547
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,055
I'm looking at my dad
and I see all five-seven of him.

548
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,726
And that's when I realize I'm a <i>darapok</i>.
I'm a scaredy-cat.

549
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:28,564
We can speak two languages.
We can speak at home and outside.

550
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,316
I should have said something. I didn't.

551
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,695
We sit down.
I hear "thud, thud, thud" outside.

552
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:39,324
Me and Dad run outside and all the windows
on the Camry are smashed in.

553
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,161
My backpack's open.
"Fuck, they stole my stuff."

554
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,497
I reach and I pull out my backpack.

555
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:48,292
Pieces of glass get caught in my arm.

556
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,794
Now blood is gushing down my arm,

557
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,171
and I'm pissed, I'm fucking mad.

558
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:54,423
Fuck this, man!

559
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,760
These kids know where we live, they're
timing this, so they're watching us.

560
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:02,014
So I'm looking in the trees, the bushes...

561
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:06,310
I look back in the middle of the street,
my dad is in the middle of the road

562
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:10,063
sweeping glass out of the road
like he works at a barbershop.

563
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:14,443
"We've got customers. <i>Log kya kahenge?</i>
We've got to clean this up."

564
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,278
Zen!

565
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,072
Brown Mr Miyagi, just, like,
not saying a word.

566
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:21,617
I'm like,
"Why aren't you saying something?

567
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,827
I'm asking you, say something!"

568
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,622
He looks at me and goes, "Hasan..."

569
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,082
[speaking Hindi]

570
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,169
[speaking Hindi]

571
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:35,339
"These things happen,

572
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,175
and these things will continue to happen.

573
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,511
That's the price we pay for being here."

574
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:46,141
That's when I was like, "We really are
from two different generations."

575
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,018
BMX bikes aside.

576
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:53,440
My dad's from that generation where
he feels like if you come to this country,

577
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,400
you pay the American dream tax.

578
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,946
You endure racism, and if it doesn't
cost you your life, pay it.

579
00:28:59,029 --> 00:29:00,405
There you go, Uncle Sam.

580
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:03,367
But for me, I was born here.

581
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,495
So I actually have the audacity
of equality.

582
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,915
I'm like, "I'm in Honors Gov,
I have it right here.

583
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:13,502
Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness.
All men created equal."

584
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,462
It says it right here, I'm equal.

585
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,422
I'm equal. I don't deserve this.

586
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,925
[deafening applause]

587
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,760
But as soon as I say that...

588
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,808
He looks at me like I believe in Santa.
"Hasan, you'll never understand."

589
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,601
"I'll never understand?

590
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,272
Dad, you're the guy that will argue
with the cashier at Costco

591
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:35,691
when he doesn't let you return
used underwear.

592
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,859
And now you want to be the bigger man?

593
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,446
Now you're like, 'Let's be reasonable
with the bigots.' What?"

594
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,702
And then he just walks back into the house
with glass in his feet.

595
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,622
And I honestly don't know
who is more right.

596
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:54,084
Maybe he's right. Put your head down.

597
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:58,422
Be a doctor, get a house in the burbs,
let them call them whatever you want.

598
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,759
But isn't it our job to push the needle
forward little by little?

599
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,304
Isn't that how all this stuff happens?

600
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,473
I don't know. The pendulum swings
back and forth for me.

601
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:12,811
And I know 9/11 is a super touchy subject.
I understand.

602
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,730
Because when it happened,

603
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,442
everyone in America felt like
their country was under attack.

604
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,653
But on that night, September 12th,

605
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:24,448
it was the first night of so many nights

606
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,993
where my family's loyalty to this country
was under attack.

607
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,662
And it always sucks.

608
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:34,916
As immigrants we always have
to put on these press releases

609
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,376
to prove our patriotism.

610
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,838
We're auditioning.
"We love this country, please believe me."

611
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,215
Nobody loves this country more than us.

612
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,052
I fell in love here.
Six years old, Janice Malo.

613
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:48,305
I saw her in the sandbox.
I run up to her. First grade.

614
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,891
"I love you!"
"You're the color of poop."

615
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,976
That's memory number one.

616
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,271
The first time you experience racism?

617
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,858
I was like, "What? Oh, no!
It's not rubbing off!"

618
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,360
I was fucking terrified.

619
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:04,404
It was like <i>Inception</i>.
There were so many levels.

620
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,615
I just wanted to wake up and be like,

621
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,659
"Oh, it was all a dream. I'm JGL.
It was all a dream."

622
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,829
But it's not a dream,
it's the universe telling you,

623
00:31:12,913 --> 00:31:15,957
"It's a Fair and Lovely world.
Navigate accordingly."

624
00:31:18,168 --> 00:31:22,923
In the third grade, Miss Anderson said,
"Write what you want to be."

625
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:26,635
Some kids were like,
"an astronaut," or "a firefighter."

626
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,387
I was like, "I want to be white."

627
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,055
[shocked laughter]

628
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,431
"What do you mean?"

629
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:34,643
"I want this part of my skin
to be all of my skin."

630
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,355
And it wasn't like, "I hate melanin."

631
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,981
I love melanin.

632
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,401
I've never gotten a sunburn. I'm blessed.

633
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:45,987
[laughter, applause, whooping]

634
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,826
But when you're white and you're
playing the video game of life,

635
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,869
and your avatar is white,

636
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,872
you just get asked less questions
along the way.

637
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,375
You pop out. Boom.
"I want to be Batman."

638
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:02,087
"Well, of course.
Batman is white. Duh!"

639
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,839
"I want to be president."

640
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,842
"Duh! Forty-four-and-a-half presidents
are white.

641
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,803
We've had a great track record."

642
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:15,142
And I know the privilege debate
is very heavy for white people.

643
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,853
I know you guys have problems.
I've seen <i>Girls.</i>

644
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,938
[laughter]

645
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:25,193
My dad did not give a shit
about any of this identity stuff.

646
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,237
His rules with me were very simple.

647
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,407
"No fun, no girlfriends.
Have fun in med school."

648
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,035
Which is a huge lie.
It never gets popping in med school.

649
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:37,873
I've never been to a club and seen
nine dudes: "Yo, what's going on?"

650
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,542
"What's going on? Residency, fam!"

651
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,043
Never happens.

652
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:46,006
"I got a career I hate from my parents."
It's a lie. We buy into it.

653
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,675
So by my senior year of high school,

654
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:53,430
I had yet to go to a school dance,
I had been cut from the basketball team,

655
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,349
and I had just got off
this medicine called Accutane

656
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,435
so my skin and face was peeling.

657
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,020
I'm crushing life.

658
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,898
Out here, killing it. No one did that.

659
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,942
Don't clap.
No one did that for that photo.

660
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:09,654
No one ever did that at my school.
It's too late.

661
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,782
But there was one bright spot,

662
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,493
this girl named Bethany Reed.

663
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:18,580
And her family had just moved
from Nebraska to Davis,

664
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,790
and we were in AP Calc together, but...

665
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,793
we had chemistry.

666
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,630
She sat behind me,
first day, she's like,

667
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,881
"Hey...

668
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,342
what's your AIM screen name?"

669
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,468
[laughter]

670
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,639
I was like, "It's about to go down.
Do you want it? I could give it to you."

671
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:39,684
Whatever I lacked in real-life game,
my digital game... bananas.

672
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,021
Status updates,
away messages, sub profile,

673
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,732
Boyz II Men. Don't say
you don't like "Water Runs Dry".

674
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,234
I was a lover.

675
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:51,112
Late at night on AIM,
back and forth, back and forth...

676
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,739
You guys don't know this.

677
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,992
Some of you guys are just in college,
Snapchatting.

678
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,746
Back in the day, we had to fire up
the internet like goddamn cavemen.

679
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,289
You know what I mean?

680
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:06,336
[makes long, crackling, buzzing noise]

681
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,338
[blows]

682
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,633
If someone picked up the phone,
"Hey, get off the phone!

683
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,927
I'm trying to talk to somebody!"

684
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,846
That's how we would communicate.

685
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:21,101
Late at night, back and forth,
back and forth.

686
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,145
One night she was like, "Hey, come over."

687
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:26,398
I bike over to her place,

688
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,276
white picket fence, McMansion,
Ford Expedition,

689
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,778
Eddie Bauer edition.

690
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,196
[audience cheers]

691
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,614
"Oh, they made it!"

692
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:38,493
Mrs Reed opens the door. Her father
is this successful retired judge.

693
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,288
Mrs Reed's like, "You want brownies?"
"Yeah. Cool."

694
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,916
"Hey, stay for dinner."
"We just had brownies, but okay."

695
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,711
We're sitting there at the dinner table.

696
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:52,299
And now Mrs Reed's like, "Hey, honey,
we know so much about Bethany,

697
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,176
but we don't know anything about you.

698
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,220
What do you like? What are you into?"

699
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,305
I was like, "What?"

700
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,390
[laughter]

701
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,267
"What do I like? Um...

702
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,684
Nobody...

703
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,396
Nobody has ever asked me that before."

704
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,440
[laughter]

705
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,483
"I guess I like acoustic guitar."

706
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,527
"You should do that.

707
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:15,363
You should follow your dreams."

708
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,200
[laughter]

709
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,869
"Maybe I will.

710
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,330
Maybe I will follow my dreams."

711
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:27,334
Then Bethany's like, "Hey,
we always study at my house.

712
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,544
Why don't we study at your house?"

713
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,380
I was like, "I've got to go."

714
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,467
What, invite you over to my house?

715
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,637
You walk in: "What language
are you guys speaking?

716
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,472
What's that smell?"

717
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,976
I'm not going to open myself up to that.
But I was like, "No, she's different."

718
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,770
I hit her up late at night.

719
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:51,483
"Mom, Dad, a school friend is coming over.
Everyone here, please be normal."

720
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,904
My dad is like, "We are normal."
Killing me, you know what I mean?

721
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,991
"Hasan, we're normal.
Be proud. You should be proud."

722
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:03,203
Who is proud? No one is.
You're walking around like a rooster.

723
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,205
I'm not proud and no one is proud.

724
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,373
We get there.

725
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,959
We're sitting on my living room table.

726
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,505
My mom and dad are arguing in Hindi.

727
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,549
My mom is frying pakoras.
The fobbiest thing ever.

728
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,220
<i>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</i>
is playing on Zee TV.

729
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,514
But it's too much.

730
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,016
It's all coming at this girl.
It's too much.

731
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,352
You've got to ease your way in.

732
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,978
She's from Nebraska.

733
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:30,814
Soul cycle, yoga, then Zee TV.

734
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,108
Don't just, like, go into it.

735
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,194
So I'm looking at her, like,
"Don't say anything.

736
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,863
Please don't say anything."

737
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:44,119
She looks up from her book,
and she's like, "You know what?

738
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:47,038
This is really nice.

739
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:51,376
We should do this more often.
This is really nice."

740
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,587
And I look at her, and I'm like,
"Oh, my God.

741
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,507
I love you, my white princess."

742
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,259
[laughter]

743
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,595
"You see me.
I don't got to change who I am?

744
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,973
I can be me!"

745
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,268
So I'm going back and forth.
Her house, my house.

746
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,855
One night, we're on the living room table.
We're doing integrals.

747
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,982
[laughter]

748
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,319
She closes her book.
She's like, "Hey. It's late."

749
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:21,239
And I'm like, "It is late."

750
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,159
And she's like...

751
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,453
"I should go home."

752
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,581
I was like, "Yeah, you should..."
Why did you say that?

753
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,541
That was your chance. Don't do that.

754
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,210
I said, "Wait, let me walk you out."

755
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,379
So I'm walking her out.

756
00:37:36,463 --> 00:37:38,757
She gets in the car.

757
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,425
I'm about to close the door.

758
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,803
She rams her arm into the door,
leans out and gives me a kiss.

759
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:46,973
"I love you." Drives off into the night.

760
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,434
Like a fucking G!

761
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,562
Because she knew the rules.

762
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,816
She knew the rules.
No fun, no friends, no girlfriends.

763
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,195
All we had was that stolen moment
in my driveway.

764
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,657
You guys are like, "I was getting handjobs
when I was nine."

765
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,826
Not me. Not this guy.

766
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,661
Not you, not you, not you.

767
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,871
Not us.

768
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,999
I was like, "Are we getting married?
I have to change my pants.

769
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,834
We are definitely getting married.

770
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:16,711
When is the <i>shaadi</i>?"

771
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,506
[applause]

772
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,842
Now, my AP Calc class was
a group of overachievers

773
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,053
and my Calc teacher, Mr Pendleton,

774
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,597
wanted us to live lives outside of school.

775
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,600
So one day he gets up
in front of the entire class.

776
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,853
"Alright, you guys are
all killing it academically

777
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:37,732
but I want you to know
there is more to life

778
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,652
than just getting into UC Berkeley."

779
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,988
One kid was like,
"I know, getting into Stanford."

780
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,742
He's like, "No, you have to live
a life worth talking about,

781
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:51,955
which is why I'm making it mandatory
for everyone in this class

782
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:54,332
to go to prom."

783
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,627
I'm like, "All 30 of us?
We're all going to prom?

784
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:58,962
AP Calc? Us?

785
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,840
Me, Jehovah's Witness girl,
Korean exchange students,

786
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,299
going to the prom?

787
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:04,717
Thirty for 30? All of us?"

788
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:06,678
I'm laughing so hard, I'm crying.

789
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,305
He's like, "Hanson, this is not funny."

790
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,975
He walks over to the board,
he pulls it down.

791
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:16,521
It's a bracket with everybody's name on it
leading up to the big dance.

792
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,315
It's March Madness for nerds.

793
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:22,527
I'm like, "Whatever,
it's not going to happen.

794
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,237
He can't do this."

795
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,656
Weeks go by.
Kids start getting dates.

796
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,033
Three days before prom
he walks to the board.

797
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:31,953
Last two names:
Hasan Minhaj, Bethany Reed.

798
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,789
The class goes nuts. They're like, "Oh!

799
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,792
They're going to fuck!"

800
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:42,046
"No, we're not! Are we?
No, no we're not."

801
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:45,216
I look at her,
"Please don't say anything."

802
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,760
She says nothing, like a G.

803
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,262
[laughter]

804
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:53,349
Bell rings. I'm walking to my locker.
I hear footsteps.

805
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,269
She's like, "Wait up."
I was like, "What's up?"

806
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:01,232
"Oh, that was crazy back there.
What are the chances?"

807
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,484
She's like, "Listen, you know,

808
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:07,196
ever since my family moved
from Nebraska,

809
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,657
you've been my best friend.

810
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,327
And you're really special to me.

811
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:15,330
This year wouldn't be the same
without you.

812
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,791
So I was wondering,
will you go to prom with me?"

813
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,421
[applause, whooping]

814
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,218
I was like, "Yes, my white princess."

815
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:33,056
As soon as I said that, I was like, "No!"
I had bitten off more than I could chew.

816
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:37,435
"No, wait. You've got cards to play.
You're good. You're a good kid.

817
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:42,690
Also, remember, parents respect honesty.
You've seen this on TV.

818
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:45,568
If you go home and are honest,

819
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,737
your parents will be like,

820
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,574
'Even though I disagree with you,
I respect your candor.

821
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:53,826
Therefore I will grant your wish.'"

822
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,705
I ran home, I was like,
"Dad, I would like to go to prom."

823
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,040
[speaking Hindi]

824
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:02,126
Which means, "I will break your face."
"Duly noted, father."

825
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:06,631
"Bethany, situation at home.
Father doesn't want us to go to prom.

826
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:09,550
I'm going to sneak out.
I live on the second story.

827
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:12,053
I'm going to jump off and land on my bike.

828
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,847
I'll bike to your place,
we dance it up,

829
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,641
and if I die, I had a great run."

830
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:20,103
You know? You're going to die,
so put it on the tombstone.

831
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,897
"Hasan Minhaj, 4.3 GPA,
kissed a white girl."

832
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,816
What an amazing way to go.

833
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,819
The night of prom rolls around.

834
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,862
I put on the JC Penney suit.

835
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,782
Spray on the Michael Jordan cologne.

836
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,743
Six puffs, one for each championship.

837
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:39,288
You don't want to overkill it
with the MJ cologne.

838
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,832
Don't be tacky.

839
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:45,712
I'm scaling down the side of my roof,
scraping my knees.

840
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,089
I jump off the roof. It's like 20 feet.

841
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,175
I jump off, I somehow land,
I get on my bike.

842
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:55,513
It's beautiful, the sun is setting,
it's one of those gorgeous evenings.

843
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,391
And I'm biking with my knees bowed out.

844
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:01,310
So my slacks don't get
caught up in the chains.

845
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:06,315
Fast enough to get there, but slow enough
to not get pit stains.

846
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,026
I'm balancing the corsage.

847
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,738
[panting]

848
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,367
"Alright, go. Go.

849
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,286
You're good. You're getting there."

850
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,163
[wild applause and cheering]

851
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,416
I get to her house. I park my bike.

852
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,877
I'm walking up to the doorstep,

853
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,963
and I'm about to ring the doorbell
when I'm like, "Wait.

854
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,091
30 second time-out. Do you understand
what's about to go down?

855
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,054
You're about to go to prom
with Bethany motherfucking Reed."

856
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:38,181
[applause]

857
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,099
"This is the American dream.

858
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,769
This is what Dad fought for."

859
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,732
Ding-dong. Mrs Reed opens the door.

860
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,069
She has this look of concern.

861
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,988
And I look over her shoulder,

862
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:58,034
and I see Jeff Burke putting a corsage
on Bethany's wrist.

863
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:00,244
[audience sighs]

864
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:04,332
And she's like, "Oh, my God, honey,
did Bethany not tell you?

865
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,503
Sweetie, we love you,
we think you're great.

866
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,671
We love that you come over and study.

867
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,175
But tonight is one of those nights...

868
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,470
We have a lot of family
back home in Nebraska

869
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,807
and we're going to be taking photos,

870
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,893
so we don't think you'd be a good fit.

871
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,479
Do you need a ride home?

872
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,731
Mr Reed can give you a ride home."

873
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,026
And I was like, "No, I have my bike."

874
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,197
And I just biked home
and played <i>Mario Kart</i>.

875
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:40,409
That's the nicest I've ever been
dressed, playing <i>Mario Kart</i>.

876
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,577
[laughter]

877
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:45,748
I wish I had said, "Fuck that,
I'm going to the dance."

878
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,250
I didn't.

879
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,086
The sad part is,
I felt bad for being there.

880
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,589
Who was I to ruin
their picture-perfect celebration?

881
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:57,635
You've seen movies. How many times
do you see that on screen?

882
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:01,097
And it's not like they were yokels
yelling "sand nigger!"

883
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,807
I could let that pass.

884
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,601
I'd eaten off their plates,
kissed their daughter.

885
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:10,064
I didn't know that people could be bigoted
even as they were smiling at you.

886
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,818
It's hard when you see people
saying they love you

887
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,112
but they're afraid at the same time.

888
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,990
And I didn't know what that meant.

889
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,158
[applause]

890
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:24,245
Then the following Monday,
during first period she finds me.

891
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,331
She's like, "Everybody
has been asking why we didn't go.

892
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:29,125
Please don't say anything.

893
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:32,253
It's a generational thing.
Please don't say anything."

894
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:36,424
And I look at her.
Second period rolls around like clockwork.

895
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,468
Mr Pendleton's like,
"So, lovebirds, what happened?

896
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:41,554
Everybody's wondering."

897
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,391
So I'm, like, "Yeah, what happened?"
Looking at her.

898
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,310
She just looks down.

899
00:44:47,393 --> 00:44:50,313
Now everybody's looking at me
so I've got to improvise.

900
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,607
I was like, "Yeah, you know,

901
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,525
I decided not to go.

902
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:58,821
I mean, dances are overrated.
They're a cliché. I decided not to go."

903
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,908
Everybody in the class looked at me.
"Wow, you dick."

904
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,661
"You stood up the new girl?
Thank God Jeff took her.

905
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,204
You're a dick."

906
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:10,041
That's the last time we ever spoke.

907
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,337
And you know,

908
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,882
time has passed,
and I don't really think about that day.

909
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,301
I mean, I did write
a show about it, but...

910
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,594
[laughter]

911
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,095
like a lot of people...

912
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,306
[cheering]

913
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,850
[more cheering, whooping]

914
00:45:27,934 --> 00:45:31,020
you move on
to different chapters of your life.

915
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:36,233
You have selective memory.
You're in college. Tools, Clear History.

916
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:39,195
Out of college.
Tools, Clear History. Never did that.

917
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,781
Married. Tools, Clear History.
Never happened.

918
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,034
Second marriage, Tools, Clear History.
Never happened.

919
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:49,080
But for the most part, I actually think
about it the way my dad does.

920
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,792
"Oh, you couldn't go to prom
with a white girl?

921
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,126
Who gives a fuck?

922
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:57,672
At least your spine isn't getting
shattered in a police wagon,

923
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,133
though it's happening
to African-Americans to this day.

924
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,970
So this is a tax you have to pay?
I'll pay it.

925
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,224
'I can't date your daughter.'
I don't give a fuck, Uncle Sam. Take it."

926
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,768
But then I realized, wait, hold on.

927
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:15,231
Why is it every time
the collateral damage has to be death,

928
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:16,816
for us to talk about this?

929
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,485
A kid has to get shot 16 times
for us to be like,

930
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,988
"Maybe we have a race problem."

931
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,699
For every Trayvon Martin
or Ahmed the clock kid,

932
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,034
there is bigotry that happens every day.

933
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:31,080
Because we're too afraid of the Other.
Someone who's not in our tribe.

934
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:33,207
I wish I could tell 18-year-old me,

935
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,961
"Hey, man, don't let
this experience define you.

936
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,172
It's good people and bad people.

937
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:43,467
Irrespective of creed, class, color,
find those people.

938
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:45,845
Because love is bigger than fear."

939
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,638
I wish I could tell him that.

940
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,474
I really believe that.

941
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,351
[applause, cheering]

942
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,443
I really believe love is bigger than fear.

943
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,278
Fox News has taught me that.

944
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,739
Fox News is incredible.

945
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:08,492
I've never seen so many people
with spray tans hate people of color.

946
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,328
It is amazing.

947
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:17,460
And Fox News is in New York.
They're in New York.

948
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,588
<i>Daily Show</i>, Fox News,
five avenues away from each other.

949
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,382
That's it.
Professor X, Magneto, that close.

950
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:26,302
Every day I walk past
their building during lunch.

951
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:29,472
I'll see all the employees,
Hannity, Coulter, O'Reilly,

952
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:33,517
leave their building,
cross the street, walk past me,

953
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,478
and line up for halal chicken and rice.

954
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,730
I'm like, "Uh...

955
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:41,025
Racist Randy wants that red sauce."

956
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,945
Your brain can be racist,
but your body will just betray you.

957
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,864
I love that so much.

958
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,118
All morning, they're like,
"Mexicans, all lives matter, Arabs...

959
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,661
12:01! Shwarma time!"

960
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:55,247
I love that so much.

961
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,335
And I wish I could tell
18-year-old me that, but I can't.

962
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,505
I don't have a time machine.
I can't tell him that.

963
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,382
You know what the shitty part is?

964
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:09,804
When you first fall in love, you get
that first taste of the Heisenberg blue.

965
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,599
It's never the same after that.

966
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:17,311
People here with girlfriends are like,
"Babe, it's different with you."

967
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,105
You're lying and that's okay.

968
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,816
But we had those first secrets.

969
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:25,736
My secret was, "I want to be a comedian."
She said, "I want to be a journalist."

970
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,905
We promised we would
follow our dreams,

971
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,699
no matter what people would think.

972
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:33,702
So I started doing comedy.
I wasn't very good.

973
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:37,081
Two years, three years, four years,
six years, seven years...

974
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,167
I finally get a chance
to headline a comedy club.

975
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:43,212
It's a big deal for me.
Gotham Comedy Club, New York City.

976
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:48,217
I did what a lot of early comedians do.
I got on Facebook, I got super cocky.

977
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,554
I was like, "Yo, Facebook!

978
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:57,143
Your boy, headlining Gotham Comedy Club.
Let me know if you want some tix."

979
00:48:57,226 --> 00:48:59,520
All caps. Like, relax! I sent it.

980
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,314
I was like, "I'm a headliner.
Let's go to the airport.

981
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:06,735
LA, Chicago, Nashville, New York...
I'm flying Southwest.

982
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,779
I was like, "I made it!

983
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:14,326
Oh, hello. La Quinta Inn!
Don't mind if I do.

984
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:16,453
Free Wi-Fi? Why not?

985
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:19,081
Let's see what the internet
is saying about me.

986
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:22,459
I open up my laptop,
fire up Facebook, and I see this.

987
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:28,883
"Hey, um, long time no see.

988
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,261
You're doing comedy now. So cool.

989
00:49:33,137 --> 00:49:36,807
Listen, me and my girlfriends
live in Manhattan

990
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,561
and we were wondering
if we could get some tix?"

991
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,687
Question mark.

992
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,355
Okay.

993
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:44,815
[laughter]

994
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,360
[sighs with pleasure as he drinks]

995
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,904
[applause]

996
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,282
I don't know if you know what this means.

997
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,953
But, you know, if life gives you lemons,

998
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,665
sometimes you've got to make
"revenge lemonade."

999
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,710
Sprinkle in a little irony.

1000
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,630
Reply, son. Reply.

1001
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,799
"Bethany, comma, enter.

1002
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,345
Totally remember you.

1003
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,306
Long time no see, indeed."

1004
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:22,144
[talks gibberish in high-pitched voice]

1005
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:24,480
"Seven years. A lot of time.

1006
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:28,943
Listen, I would love to give you some tix,

1007
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:33,113
but we're going to be taking
a lot of photos tonight...

1008
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:37,368
[audience gasps, applauds]

1009
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,703
and I don't think you'd be a good fit."

1010
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,122
Send that shit! Send that shit right now!

1011
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:44,917
Send that shit right now!

1012
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,918
I jump on stage!

1013
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:50,005
I run to the club, jump on stage...
I don't even know what I said.

1014
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,966
I was like, "Fuck that. Goodnight."

1015
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,843
Boom. I go to the airport.

1016
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:58,555
We go from New York, Chicago,
to Nashville to LA.

1017
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,393
I pick up my Toyota Camry
L-motherfucking-E.

1018
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,604
Don't you ever forget about it.
Cloth interior for life.

1019
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,899
Whipping through the streets of LA.

1020
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,235
"Hello, headliner. What do you need?"

1021
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,529
"Hasan <i>bhai</i>, Dad had a heart attack.

1022
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,364
Hey...

1023
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,491
idiot, pick up your phone.

1024
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,743
I need you. Dad had a heart attack."

1025
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,163
My dad had just suffered
a quintuple bypass.

1026
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,083
So they're rushing him to the hospital.

1027
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,876
Aisha goes, "Come home, now."

1028
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,672
I was like, "I got a set
at the Comedy Store.

1029
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,967
I'm going to do that,
then I'll come home."

1030
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,429
And I did a set at the Comedy Store.

1031
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,432
And then I drove home.

1032
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,268
And I don't know why...

1033
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,898
I get to Kaiser and run upstairs.
My mom and my sisters are crying.

1034
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:54,320
My sister looks at me, she's like,
"They don't know what you did. I do."

1035
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,281
Doctor sees me. "Are you his son?"
"Yeah."

1036
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,283
"You're over 18? Sign this."

1037
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,368
I sign this waiver

1038
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:06,123
that clears the hospital of liability
if something happens to my dad.

1039
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:08,083
The surgery is that risky.

1040
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,837
I'm signing this piece of paper
and looking at him,

1041
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,299
and I feel like I'm signing
a death certificate.

1042
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:18,886
His body temperature is so low
that he looks blue.

1043
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:23,515
They wheel him into surgery
and I hand the clipboard to the doctor.

1044
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,353
I look at my dad, like,
"If this is the last time I see my dad...

1045
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,315
I'm saying goodbye
to a person I barely even know."

1046
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,570
And I'm waiting, hoping
that he comes out of surgery okay.

1047
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:39,448
And somehow he makes it through.

1048
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,993
We're in the hospital.
I have to tell him stories.

1049
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:47,081
So I'm telling him stories about my life,
he's telling me stories about his.

1050
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,083
So I tell him the prom story.

1051
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,002
He goes, "Hasan, I'm mad at you."

1052
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,547
"I know, I kissed a girl.
I'll never do it again."

1053
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,424
[laughter]

1054
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,801
He goes, "No...

1055
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,011
why don't you forgive Bethany?"

1056
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,056
[speaking Hindi]

1057
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,934
He wanted to be the bigger person again.

1058
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,061
I was like, "Why?"

1059
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,147
"You know when I emigrated
to this country in 1982,

1060
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:15,526
I thought if I let you go
to a school dance,

1061
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:19,488
you would join a gang, get a girl pregnant
and become a drug dealer, in one night.

1062
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:21,031
I wanted to protect you.

1063
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,993
Her family saw stuff about us.
They wanted to protect their daughter.

1064
00:53:25,077 --> 00:53:27,871
Everybody's afraid of everybody.
But Hasan..."

1065
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:31,125
[speaking Hindi]

1066
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:37,506
[speaking Hindi,
voice becomes more insistent]

1067
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,552
"Hasan, you have to be brave.

1068
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:46,432
Your courage to do what's right
has to be greater than your fear.

1069
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,268
So, Hasan, be brave. Hasan, be brave."

1070
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:53,564
It's a very beautiful poem.
I think about it all the time.

1071
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,693
And look, there are some days
where I can forgive that person.

1072
00:53:57,776 --> 00:54:01,071
The past is the past.
Tools, Clear History. It's done.

1073
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:02,739
Other days, "No, fuck that.

1074
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:05,284
This is <i>House of Cards</i>.
Crush our enemies."

1075
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,828
I didn't know how to feel, until this.

1076
00:54:08,412 --> 00:54:11,540
<i>Pizza Hut new big pizza sliders are here.</i>

1077
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,209
<i>Get nine in a box for just ten bucks.</i>

1078
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:15,627
<i>Ten bucks.</i>

1079
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:17,713
<i>Match up to three ways.</i>

1080
00:54:18,172 --> 00:54:19,965
<i>Three? Cheese!</i>

1081
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:23,427
<i>Big, delicious sliders,
only at your Pizza Hut.</i>

1082
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,804
<i>And that's how you make it great.</i>

1083
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:27,723
Alright, so...

1084
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:31,059
so this airs during March Madness.

1085
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:34,980
Everyone sees it. The night this airs,
friends send me text messages.

1086
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,273
"Hey, man,

1087
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,941
by any chance do you know

1088
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,612
how many pizza sliders you get in a box
for just ten bucks?"

1089
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,822
[laughter]

1090
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,868
"Nine!"

1091
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,747
"Is it true you can mix and match
up to three ways?"

1092
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:53,916
[laughter]

1093
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,584
"Yes, three. Yes."

1094
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,754
A buddy of mine sends me this screengrab.

1095
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:06,220
"Just saw my high school prom date
in a Pizza Hut ad."

1096
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:08,222
#throwback.

1097
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,806
#it's a small world.

1098
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,559
#brilliant.

1099
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,562
To which I reply,

1100
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:20,567
"We didn't end up going, though.

1101
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,070
How've you been?"

1102
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,697
#MrP.

1103
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,116
#Calc.

1104
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,911
To which she replies,

1105
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:36,667
"I know! Made for a better tweet though.

1106
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,294
Let me know when you're in New York."

1107
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:41,672
To which I reply,

1108
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,757
"abso-fucking-lutely."

1109
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:47,636
Now, against the advice of my therapist
I go on Facebook,

1110
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,805
because she has a public profile.

1111
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:53,433
So I start clicking around.
"Bethany Reed." Okay.

1112
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,228
"Lives in Manhattan." Duh, we knew that.

1113
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,147
"In a relationship with..." I click it.

1114
00:56:01,108 --> 00:56:04,486
[audience gasps, applause]

1115
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:17,541
"Rajesh...

1116
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:20,168
Rengatramanajanana..."

1117
00:56:20,252 --> 00:56:22,754
She is dating an Indian dude,

1118
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,965
and this dude is Indian as fuck.

1119
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,842
Look at his name!

1120
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,386
Look at how big his name is.

1121
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:33,348
It's so big, it barely fits
in his Facebook profile.

1122
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,809
So big. Ten syllables.

1123
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:40,981
Ra-jesh Ren-gat-ra-ma-na-ja-na-nam.

1124
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,234
Are you kidding me?
How many letters are in the alphabet?

1125
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,405
How many letters in the alphabet?
26 letters in the alphabet, right?

1126
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,283
How many letters are in
Rajesh Rengatramanajananam? 25.

1127
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,494
That's one less letter
than the entire alphabet.

1128
00:56:54,578 --> 00:56:57,789
Come on! How easy is my name?
Hasan Minhaj. So easy.

1129
00:56:57,873 --> 00:57:00,000
She was like, "Fuck that.

1130
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,170
Give me the Rajesh Rengatramana...

1131
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:05,005
motherfucking-jananam."

1132
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,508
Like, "No!" God is laughing at me.
God is laughing at me.

1133
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,553
Now, against the advice of my therapist...

1134
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:13,889
I make contact.

1135
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,559
She's like, "Do not make contact."
I'm like, "Tell me what I want to hear."

1136
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,020
"Need closure? Go for it."
"See you next week."

1137
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,188
Therapy is bullshit.

1138
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,734
"Bethany, I've got a gig in New York
next week. I would love to meet up."

1139
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,278
She's like, "Yeah, let's meet up."

1140
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:32,491
And I go from LA to New York,
direct flight. Pizza Hut money.

1141
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:35,535
I'm walking through New York. I'm livid.

1142
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,662
I'm pissed.

1143
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,664
How is this possible?

1144
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,416
How is this possible?
Rajesh Rengatramana...

1145
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,210
How does she make love?

1146
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,545
"Oh, my God,
Rajesh Rengatramanajananam,

1147
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:47,214
give it to me right now.

1148
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,425
Rajesh Rengatramanajananam,
I want you so bad.

1149
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:52,803
Put your Rajesh
in my Rengatramanajananam."

1150
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,262
I was like, "Stop it.

1151
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:59,059
Stop imagining her having sex
with Rajesh Rengatramanajananam.

1152
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:02,020
You've got leverage.

1153
00:58:02,104 --> 00:58:05,565
Walk in there, be cool.
Walk in there, be confident.

1154
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:08,819
Be like this, dude.
Walk in there and just own it.

1155
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,238
Be like this, be like this."

1156
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:15,075
[laughter]

1157
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,744
[whistling, whooping]

1158
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,621
"What's up?"

1159
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:23,375
Do that with this, and then lick the lips
and go, "What's up?"

1160
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,085
I'm practicing it.

1161
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,046
I get to the door, open the door,

1162
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,965
then I hear, "Hey, Hasan!"

1163
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:32,175
She's sitting outside.

1164
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,929
She saw me doing this shit
in the street.

1165
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,307
[applause]

1166
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,104
I was like, "Oh, hey, what's up?

1167
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,482
Is someone sitting there? Cool."

1168
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:50,485
I just walk up and I'm like,
"Alright, yeah.

1169
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:52,738
I'll just sit here, cool."

1170
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,906
I'm sitting there.

1171
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:57,325
When you see
someone from your past,

1172
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:59,953
all of a sudden, you're that age again.

1173
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:04,541
So all that Kanye juice
just goes out of my body.

1174
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:07,502
I can't say anything.

1175
00:59:07,586 --> 00:59:09,713
It's like the adults in <i>Charlie Brown.</i>

1176
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:13,008
I can't say anything.
20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes.

1177
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,053
"Dude, are you going to be
a <i>darapok </i>again?

1178
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,721
Say something."

1179
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,475
She starts talking about rent control
and I cut her off.

1180
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,435
"Bethany, do you know why I'm here?

1181
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,646
I'm here to talk about prom."

1182
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,608
[laughter]

1183
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,611
And her face went white.

1184
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:37,074
You guys knew she was white?
It went whiter than white.

1185
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,243
And I was like, "You knew my situation.
You knew it.

1186
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:42,954
I was ride or die for you.
At that age, that's a lot.

1187
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:46,083
You weren't the same for me, fine.
Whatever.

1188
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:48,168
But what makes matters worse is,

1189
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,253
you had me socially crucified.

1190
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:52,005
You knew how hard it was for me,

1191
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:56,718
and then I was so insecure at that age
that I couldn't date another white person,

1192
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:00,097
because I was afraid of not being able
to be with them,

1193
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:02,724
because of the color of my skin.

1194
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:04,601
Do you know what that's like?

1195
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,853
And now, I'm trying to pursue my dreams,

1196
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,438
I'm trying,

1197
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,900
but now you're writing about me,
you act like we're cool,

1198
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,860
when we're not.

1199
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,238
Why do you do that?"

1200
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:21,034
And she was like, "I am so sorry.

1201
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:25,080
But you know we were 18, right?

1202
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:28,583
Like, I really wanted to go with you.

1203
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:30,836
But my mom, she's very controlling.

1204
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:35,048
Do you know what it's like to have
a parent that controls your life?"

1205
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:40,345
"No, I don't. What is that like? Do tell.
I would love to hear that story."

1206
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:41,429
[cheering]

1207
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,681
"Tell me more."

1208
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,643
What?

1209
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,104
She's like, "I wish I could
have gone with you.

1210
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,231
But I can't change the past.

1211
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:55,777
I never thought you would want
to talk to me ever again.

1212
01:00:55,861 --> 01:00:58,280
But the reason why I write about you

1213
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,991
is because I see you kept your promise.

1214
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,911
So even if you never want
to talk to me ever again,

1215
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:07,664
I'll always be rooting for you."

1216
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:12,919
You know how you carry hatred
in your heart about people in your past?

1217
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:15,172
"They did this to me. Fuck them."

1218
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,590
Damn them.

1219
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:22,012
In that moment, I let it go.

1220
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,890
I crushed it like a Voldemort Horcrux.

1221
01:01:24,973 --> 01:01:27,309
[makes crushing sounds]

1222
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:31,062
[cheering, applause]

1223
01:01:33,732 --> 01:01:37,110
But I had to ask her the question
that we're all thinking.

1224
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,780
[laughter]

1225
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,909
"What about Mr Rengatramanajananam?"

1226
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:47,954
She's like, "I hit it off with this guy.
We decide to move in together.

1227
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:50,874
I needed money for a deposit
so I called my mom."

1228
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,417
"What did your mom say?"

1229
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:56,630
"My mom was like, 'No.
You know the way our family is.

1230
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,465
So make up your mind.'"

1231
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,343
And I was like, "What did you say?"

1232
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,929
And she's like,
"I told my mom, 'Not again.

1233
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,974
This isn't high school.
Raj is a good person and so am I.

1234
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:10,727
So I'm going to be with him
because it's right.

1235
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,021
I hope you make up your mind.'"

1236
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:16,483
And I'm looking at her,

1237
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,069
and I'm so embarrassed.

1238
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,156
I'm like, "Dude, what are you doing?

1239
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:28,662
Why are you hunting down people
from your past like a psycho?

1240
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,038
[laughter]

1241
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:33,041
You're not Liam Neeson.
What is going on?"

1242
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,212
I realized, "You don't give a shit
about this person."

1243
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,005
I care about what she represents.

1244
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:42,217
Growing up, we just want that co-sign.

1245
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,219
To tell them you're good enough.

1246
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:48,431
"Sit here. You're good enough."
But that's not the American dream.

1247
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:52,811
It's not asking for a co-sign.
It's what every generation did before you.

1248
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:54,980
You claim that shit on your own terms.

1249
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,816
Pizza Hut pizza sliders.
Nine in a box for just ten bucks.

1250
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,109
That's you.

1251
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:03,238
You're not Hasan Minhaj.
You're "Hussan Minhajj".

1252
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:07,409
This is new brown America. The dream
is for you to take, so take that shit.

1253
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:09,244
Stop blaming other people.

1254
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,330
[cheering, whooping]

1255
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:19,671
Now I'm standing outside the restaurant
and I can't even concentrate,

1256
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,048
because I know she's
more evolved than me.

1257
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,968
She's like, "Next time,
me, you and Raj should hang out."

1258
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:29,306
I'm like, "Yeah, let's not do that."
And I'm walking to the subway station.

1259
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,434
But I take one last look
at the restaurant.

1260
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,728
Just to see her one last time.

1261
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,231
To know that generational change
is possible with one choice.

1262
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,567
I turn around and I look,

1263
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,445
but she's gone.

1264
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,114
And I never saw her again.

1265
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:50,785
I did keep my promise, though.
You know, I kept doing comedy.

1266
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,370
I never knew...

1267
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:56,082
I never knew if I would do
anything more than Pizza Hut.

1268
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,293
You know how you hit that point

1269
01:03:58,376 --> 01:04:01,171
when your parents give up on you
and move on?

1270
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,797
"Let's move on to Aisha."

1271
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:06,176
One day I get an email
from my manager.

1272
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:10,722
"Want to audition for <i>The Daily Show</i>?"
That's not a question. That's a statement.

1273
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,724
"Hey, audition for <i>The Daily Show.</i>"

1274
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,185
I submit a tape. I get a call.

1275
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,188
"Jon Stewart saw your tape.
Come to New York.

1276
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:19,898
They want you to audition.

1277
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:22,609
But, but...

1278
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,654
you have to write another original piece.

1279
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,323
Can you write another?"

1280
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,743
"No, I can't. I'm not Larry David.

1281
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,829
I can't do <i>Seinfeld </i>and <i>Curb.</i>
I'm a mere mortal."

1282
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:37,415
I'm walking back and forth
in my apartment,

1283
01:04:37,499 --> 01:04:39,709
like, "I'm going to die here."

1284
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:43,171
And it's amazing
how racism will always happen to you

1285
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,964
when you need it the most.

1286
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:49,761
Like changing the oil on your car.
"Oh, 15,000 miles. Racism."

1287
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:52,514
So I'm watching <i>Real Time With Bill Maher.</i>

1288
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:55,558
Have you guys seen
<i>Real Time With Bill Maher</i>?

1289
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:57,310
You know Bill's demeanor.

1290
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,647
"Hey, do you believe in God?
You're a fucking idiot."

1291
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,484
And everyone's like,
"Oh, the atheist prophet speaks!"

1292
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,821
So this clip went viral,
him and Ben Affleck.

1293
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:11,908
Bill Maher is like, "These Muslims,
85 percent of them hate our freedom.

1294
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,453
We've got to round them up,
we've got to contain them."

1295
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:19,290
And Ben Affleck's like, "Are you crazy?
Round them up, contain them?

1296
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:23,586
Dude, we did that to the Japanese.
You can't do that. Am I crazy?"

1297
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:25,839
And I was like, "No, you're not crazy.

1298
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:28,299
You're my white prince."

1299
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,301
[laughter, applause]

1300
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:33,430
Don't you realize
what happened in that moment?

1301
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:36,850
We got our first A-list celebrity
to back the Muslim community.

1302
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:38,518
We got Batman, baby!

1303
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,730
"He may not be the hero we want, but he is
the hero the Muslim world needs."

1304
01:05:42,814 --> 01:05:44,357
"Batman versus Bill Maher."

1305
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,652
I write the piece, go to New York.

1306
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,362
You get it, right?

1307
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:52,365
The producer answers the door:
"Audition with me.

1308
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,951
When you're ready, Jon will come down.

1309
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,161
Run it with me."

1310
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,246
We're walking down the hallway,

1311
01:05:58,329 --> 01:06:03,084
and I see all these photos of the old
correspondents that came before me.

1312
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:06,421
Steve Carell, John Oliver,

1313
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,756
Sam Bee, Jason Jones,

1314
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:11,759
Ed Helms, Steven Colbert...

1315
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,303
and me?

1316
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,139
<i>Keema roti</i>, me?

1317
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,310
You know we don't end up this far.
You know the way it is.

1318
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,520
Middle management till we die.

1319
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,772
We're not on that stage, ever.

1320
01:06:26,065 --> 01:06:28,568
I walk in and I see that <i>Daily Show </i>globe.

1321
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,778
I can't tell you how blue it is.

1322
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,740
And now I'm sweating through my suit.

1323
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,035
The producer is like,
"We'll run it a few times."

1324
01:06:37,118 --> 01:06:39,704
And I sit down and I get to the desk.

1325
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,081
Sitting presidents
have sat on that desk.

1326
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:45,627
I sit down and we're running it,
and I'm nervous.

1327
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,214
He goes, "Hey, man,
just slow down. Alright?"

1328
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:52,342
We run it a second time.
Now I'm stuttering.

1329
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,970
And he goes,
"Hey, man, relax. You're funny."

1330
01:06:56,596 --> 01:07:00,683
Which is a tell-tale sign of being, like,
"Hey, man. You're not funny.

1331
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,186
You shouldn't relax."

1332
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:06,356
And I can feel it. I'm choking.
We've all been there.

1333
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:10,109
Everyone's, "How did it go?"
You're like, "Positive thoughts."

1334
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,863
No, it's not happening. You're not.
You are choking.

1335
01:07:13,947 --> 01:07:16,991
MCAT, DAT, you're going to the Caribbean,
it's a wrap.

1336
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:20,912
You choked, right? Too real? It's real.
We've all been there.

1337
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:24,165
And I can feel this turtle head
coming out of my butt.

1338
01:07:24,249 --> 01:07:27,502
I'm really nervous. I'm pooping my pants.
I'm like, "No!"

1339
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,962
Then I hear...

1340
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:32,006
[sings <i>Daily Show </i>theme]

1341
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:34,759
I know that voice.
It's Jewish Yoda. It's Jon.

1342
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:40,223
He's walking through the tunnel
where the guests come,

1343
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,558
so he's just back-lit.

1344
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:45,979
So I just see a giant shadow
walking towards me,

1345
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:49,023
and I hear his accomplishments
at each step.

1346
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,402
"Boom! I am Jon Stewart.

1347
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:56,990
Boom! Twenty-two-time
Emmy-award-winning Jon Stewart.

1348
01:07:57,574 --> 01:08:02,579
Boom! I redefined political satire
and comedy. What have you done?"

1349
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,123
I'm like, "Have you heard of Pizza Hut?"

1350
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:07,500
[laughter]

1351
01:08:07,584 --> 01:08:10,461
[applause, whooping]

1352
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,925
Then he steps into the light,

1353
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:19,053
and he's shorter than I thought.

1354
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,472
And he has all this scruff on his face.

1355
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:25,143
And I look at him, and I'm like...

1356
01:08:26,144 --> 01:08:27,562
"Dad?"

1357
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,773
He had Jewish Najmi vibes.
He shakes my hand.

1358
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:33,943
I could feel it,
like he'd slapped me in a previous life.

1359
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,528
I was like, "I know this hand!"

1360
01:08:35,612 --> 01:08:38,364
He starts riffing, I start riffing.

1361
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:41,451
The prompter guy: "What are you doing?"
"I got this."

1362
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,911
I had it all memorized.
One shot, <i>Eight Mile</i>.

1363
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:46,998
And I stuck my landing
like a Russian gymnast.

1364
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,208
"Thank you for the opportunity."

1365
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:52,754
I tucked that turtle head
back in my butt. "We're going home."

1366
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,548
I walk out the door,
but then I hear a voice.

1367
01:08:55,632 --> 01:08:57,925
"Hey, man, where are you going?"

1368
01:08:58,009 --> 01:08:59,636
And it's Jon.

1369
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,181
I was like, "Oh, I live in LA.

1370
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,352
I've got to go back to LA."

1371
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,979
"Well, I'll see you Monday, right?"

1372
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,732
I was like, "Why?"

1373
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,110
"Well, you work here.

1374
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,946
So I'll see you Monday, right?"

1375
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,616
[huge cheer]

1376
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:24,952
I couldn't believe it. I was like,
"Oscar speech, go.

1377
01:09:25,036 --> 01:09:26,663
Say what you got to say."

1378
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:28,247
What I wanted to say was,

1379
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:32,543
"Jon, this is one of the only things
that I've gotten

1380
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,797
in my entire career

1381
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:37,757
that my dad actually knows."

1382
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,883
[laughter]

1383
01:09:38,966 --> 01:09:40,635
"So thank you."

1384
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:43,304
But what I said was,

1385
01:09:43,388 --> 01:09:45,056
"Jon!

1386
01:09:45,682 --> 01:09:47,350
My dad...

1387
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,353
knows you!"

1388
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,030
He's like, "Yeah, I'm sure he does."

1389
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:05,618
I pinch myself. "You're Hasan Minhaj.
You're going to be on <i>The Daily Show</i>."

1390
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:09,664
I run outside.
I call my girl. She's crying.

1391
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,499
I call my mom, she's crying.

1392
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,626
I call my dad, he says "Good job."

1393
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:18,881
"What? 'Good job'? Say it again.
I can't hear you, Dad. Say it."

1394
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:22,927
A car almost hits me.
I'm, like, "No! I can't die.

1395
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,346
I've got to drop
the greatest status update."

1396
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,266
I run upstairs, open my laptop,
fire up Facebook,

1397
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:29,475
and then I see this.

1398
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:35,022
[audience gasps, moans]

1399
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,572
[quiet laughter]

1400
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,116
You guys see this, right?

1401
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,618
[laughter]

1402
01:10:47,702 --> 01:10:49,454
Don't you know what this means?

1403
01:10:50,955 --> 01:10:52,498
Don't you get it?

1404
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:56,544
I'm the cure for racism.

1405
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:59,005
[laughter, applause]

1406
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:00,715
I cured it.

1407
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:05,428
Alright, maybe I didn't cure it,
but everyone has a purpose.

1408
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:08,347
Some people were put here
to find a cure for cancer,

1409
01:11:08,431 --> 01:11:09,932
or find a vaccine for Ebola.

1410
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:14,353
My life is definitive proof
that once you go brown,

1411
01:11:14,437 --> 01:11:16,272
you've got to lock that shit down.

1412
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:21,194
[huge cheer, applause]

1413
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:31,204
Thank you. Thank you.

1414
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:35,082
Good night. Be well.
God bless. I love you guys.

1415
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,835
I love you guys. Good night. I love you.

1416
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:43,132
