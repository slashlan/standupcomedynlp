00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:11,970
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL
COMEDY SPECIAL

2
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:31,364
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

3
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,950
How's it going, guys? Good?

4
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,078
Let's get started.

5
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,747
Girls, okay,

6
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:42,876
do you remember the first time
you found out about blow jobs?

7
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,419
Do you remember that day?

8
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,923
It should be a different day
than the first day you gave a blow job.

9
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:52,927
I hope those were vastly different days
for you.

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,930
I hope you had a lot of time
to process that information.

11
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,767
I know I needed it. I was...

12
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:03,688
The day I found out about blow jobs,
it was a pivotal day of my life. It was...

13
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,941
I remember the date actually,
it was September 11th, 2001,

14
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,487
and I don't know what else happened
that day.

15
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,533
Devastated.

16
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,496
I... couldn't understand it.

17
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,998
At first I go,
"Blow job? Blow? Do you blow on it?"

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,122
Remember that?
Remember for a couple seconds you go,

19
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,627
"Do you blow it? Uh!"

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,050
You wish.
You wish that's all you had to do to it.

21
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,552
Oh, that'd be a cakewalk.

22
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,389
It's much more invasive than that.

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,975
Blowing on it!

24
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,106
No, I didn't... I couldn't believe
you have to like suck it.

25
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,111
You have to like French a dick.
I was like you...

26
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,452
I thought I could, maybe like, mwah,
like peck it, but you got to French it.

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,700
All I knew about penises
at this point in my life were

28
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,269
that they're these noodly things
that hung between a guy's legs,

29
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,796
they pee from them,
and you shouldn't look at your cousin JD's

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,565
when you guys are getting changed
to go swimming.

31
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,467
Like, that's all the information
I had about penises.

32
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:17,595
And now, one's going to go in my mouth.

33
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,768
Okay, I knew that sex was a thing,
a penis would go in my vagina some day,

34
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,937
but that was... It’s my vagina.

35
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,773
Like, I don’t have tastebuds down there,
or whatever...

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,528
Like, stick whatever you want down there,
I can’t taste it, okay?

37
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,656
So, I was like,
"Who cares about my vagina?

38
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,576
But my mouth? That’s where candy goes.

39
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,912
Like, I can't believe you would
put a dick there."

40
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,291
I was devastated.

41
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:51,462
And you like... You kind of go,
"Maybe I don't have to do it,

42
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,882
maybe it's something
that not every girl does."

43
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,468
And then you realize
it's kind of your destiny as a woman.

44
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,387
Like, you're gonna do it.

45
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,348
You know when I realized
you have to do it?

46
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,642
Is when I found out
it was one of the bases.

47
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,354
'Cause I knew homeplate was sex,
and if I ever wanted to have sex,

48
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,982
'cause I wanted to, I don't know,
make a family someday,

49
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,317
I was gonna have to...

50
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,987
You can't skip a base, if you want kids
you're going to have to suck some dicks

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,488
on the way to those kids.

52
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,827
That's the last thing
my kids want me doing.

53
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,627
Sex made sense 'cause it makes kids.

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,879
What do blow jobs make, you know?

55
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,506
And then you find out, careers.
And it's like, "Okay.

56
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,678
I do want one of those.
I would like to have one of those."

57
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:44,681
I got one.

58
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,730
You accept it. You're just like,
"Okay, I'll do that someday.

59
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,399
Not today, but it's going to happen. I..."

60
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,112
I accepted it the same way
I kind of accept death.

61
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,876
I feel like, you know when you find out
about dying and you're like,

62
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,117
"Oh, no. I don't wanna die."

63
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,745
And it's like, sorry you have to,
you were born, so someday

64
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,205
you have to suck a dick and die.

65
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:11,542
Like, those are kind of like
the touchstones of a woman's life.

66
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,964
You might get to vote and go to college
somewhere in there,

67
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,633
but then it's back to sucking dicks
and grave time.

68
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:25,515
And then more information
about blow jobs trickles in.

69
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:32,480
Like, okay, if you do a good job at it
you're rewarded at the end

70
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:35,900
with a liquid substance.

71
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,363
Hold on, before the liquid
you will know it's about to come

72
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,033
because he's going to turn into a demon
for a couple seconds. Sorry.

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,745
Yeah, that's a key part
of this whole thing.

74
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,539
He's going to shape-shift...

75
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,836
No one warned me about that.

76
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,631
I'm here to...
If someone hasn't had sex before,

77
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,568
I'm here to tell you before he comes,
about five seconds before he comes,

78
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,679
he turns... Every man turns into

79
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,056
Vincent D'Onofrio's character
in Men In Black.

80
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,602
You know the...
That's every man is on his way to that.

81
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,770
I don't know.

82
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,231
It's just like a...

83
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,402
Like a roach crawling out of your eye,
just...

84
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,906
It's frightening.

85
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,163
And you're like, "The liquids,
I didn't know...

86
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,581
I don't know any liquids."

87
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,167
All I know about that comes out of a guy
is pee at this point.

88
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,210
I'm like, "Is it pee?"
They're like, "You wish.

89
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,173
Oh God, again. So naive, 'pee'."

90
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,718
It's much more viscous than pee. It's...

91
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,763
Pee has the consistency of like
a <i>Gatorade,</i>

92
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:51,351
whereas semen,
it's more like a bum's loogie, if...

93
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,358
It's what it is.

94
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,904
I know it's gross, but when you like...
These are facts and...

95
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,992
When you spell it out like that,
aren't you, girls, aren't you just like...

96
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:13,539
Like, we're so strong.
Like, we... can do anything.

97
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,291
Yes.

98
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,586
I can't believe we do it.

99
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,548
I couldn't believe about that liquid.
I was just like, "That is awful.

100
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,258
Where does it come from?"

101
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,928
And then you find out
it comes from the sack

102
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,721
that rests beneath the noodle,

103
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,183
the grossest part of a guy's body
that's covered in hair and every...

104
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,351
The balls!

105
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,853
It's so gross. The liquid's so gross,

106
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,649
the male body has found a way
to store it outside of the body,

107
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,110
because it's like,
"I don't want this in me, either."

108
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,989
It's just a...
Balls are just a crock pot for the liquid,

109
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,325
that's been on simmer all day.

110
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,372
And then, it drains into your head.

111
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,543
I just... It just kept getting worse.

112
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,754
What do you do with it?

113
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,507
And that's where you find out
you get to exercise your right

114
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,175
to choose as a woman.

115
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,555
Thank God, finally.

116
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,600
That's... And that's a right
Congress will never take from us, ladies.

117
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,061
Oh, they'll try.

118
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,772
They probably will, but...

119
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:24,444
You have two choices,
you can spit or you can swallow.

120
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,196
Right, you got to register as one
before November 9th.

121
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,866
Just make sure you know
what you're gonna do.

122
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,036
I knew what I was gonna do.
I was registered as a spitter

123
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,081
long before I ever got in that booth,
you know what I'm saying?

124
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,667
I knew I was gonna spit,
because I knew about girls who spit

125
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,688
and I knew about girls who swallowed.
Girls who spit are grossed out by it,

126
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,630
and they're like... "Fuck off, gross."

127
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,175
And guys don't appreciate it,
but it's far better

128
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,658
than a girl who swallows,
'cause I knew girls that swallow...

129
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,472
Oh, these sloven whores, they love it.

130
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,266
It's fuel for them.

131
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,852
It's how they survive.

132
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:05,443
It's the base of a slut's food pyramid.
It's just a sturdy base of come.

133
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,197
And so, I was like,

134
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,741
"I'm not gonna be a slut.
Like, I don't wanna be that.

135
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,785
So, when I give a blow job
I'm totally gonna spit."

136
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,704
So, I get in there,
I give my first blow job

137
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:19,957
and I swallowed immediately,
'cause I was like, "This is disgusting.

138
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,085
Let's get it down the hatch.
Take it like a shot. Like, this...

139
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,631
is clearly the most efficient way
to dispose of this."

140
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,333
Immediately. I didn't even have
to think twice about it.

141
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,930
I've never spit, and...

142
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,890
Ever!

143
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:39,227
If you spit, that means you have
to hold it in your mouth as you like

144
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,647
walk through his apartment
and find the bathroom

145
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,066
that he shares with his roommates,
you run into them,

146
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,360
they're all watching <i>Varsity Blues</i>
in the living room.

147
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,779
You have to be like,
"Hey guys, is anyone in there?

148
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,448
Can I get in or...?
Oh, so, Andrew's in the shower.

149
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,325
I'll wait. It's fine. I love this movie.

150
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,578
What is... This is such a good movie,
I forget.

151
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,789
You forget how good it is.

152
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,505
You're quoting classic lines. I'm like,
"I don't want your life."

153
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,588
Like, and I can...

154
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,050
It's a better James Van Der Beek
because of it.

155
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,678
Okay, it's one benefit of it.

156
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,431
But you're doing like a wine tasting,
like you're just...

157
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,074
And don't get it twisted, guys,
a girl isn't... She's not swallowing

158
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,358
'cause she's like,
"Yummy cummy in my tummy."

159
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,944
No.

160
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,533
I mean, sometimes.

161
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,121
Turns out I'm a whore. Pretty big whore.

162
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,457
But, it's usually 'cause you're just like,
"This is the way to get it done."

163
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,061
Sometimes, if I think a load
is gonna be really gross, I'm like,

164
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,965
"Let's deepthroat."
So it's like a feeding tube,

165
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,256
and I don't have to touch it
to my taste buds, so...

166
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:53,884
Pro tip.

167
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,719
You're welcome.

168
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,019
Some girls love sucking dick.
They like love it.

169
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,437
And I've never understood it.

170
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,397
I'm like,
"What are you getting out of it?"

171
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,816
And then I realize,
it's 'cause they're good at it.

172
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,777
That's it. It's as simple as that, truly.

173
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,739
If you're... If you love sucking dick,
it's 'cause you're good at it.

174
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:17,217
And if you don't like it, if you're like,
"I hate blow jobs."

175
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,244
It's 'cause you're bad at it.
It's... You're really bad at it.

176
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,996
We like doing things we're good at,

177
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,248
and if you're good at it
you would do it all the time.

178
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,751
If you're just like,
"It's such a bore, it's such a pain."

179
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,879
You suck at it and I'm one of you.

180
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,298
I could have been good.

181
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,800
All it would have taken
was one guy to just like

182
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,178
give me a compliment early on, you know.

183
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,931
Someone to just like show me
that I had a little promise or something.

184
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,643
Just send me off in the right direction.

185
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,731
We just want to be good.
And... It's early intervention is key.

186
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:53,611
Like, I feel like true blowjob queens,
girls that are like, "I love it."

187
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,488
It was like one of the first times

188
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:59,909
they gave a blowjob, the guy was like,
"You're great," and like believed in them.

189
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,162
'Cause that's what it takes.
It takes one guy.

190
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,246
One coach.

191
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,793
One youth minister to lay the foundation
for a girl.

192
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,590
The first time, oh, you're so nervous,

193
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,134
and all you want is a guy
to just take your chin and be like,

194
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,969
"Hey, look up." And you go, "What?"

195
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,433
He's like, "You've got spunk...

196
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:30,314
in your hair, but like the way that you
handled my balls is pretty cool.

197
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,566
And I think you're on to something."
Just anything.

198
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,609
Little nudge.

199
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,656
And that's why I tell guys, lie to us.

200
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,867
Tell us we're good and we'll blow you
all the time.

201
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,027
Honestly, like, you hook up with a girl
and she blows you and it's not very good,

202
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,808
just lie and be like,
"That was the best blow job ever."

203
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,834
'Cause she'll just be like, "It was?"

204
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,629
And then, she'll like set off on a course
to like be the best,

205
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:58,175
and she'll go out and she'll be like,
"I was good once." You know?

206
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,306
And I know you're like,
"Why would I encourage a bad blow job?"

207
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,190
First of all,
she's going to blow you a bunch,

208
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,227
'cause this bitch
has never heard she's good.

209
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,104
She's going to be like,
"This guy gets it."

210
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,440
And then, she's going to blow you a bunch.

211
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,445
And she's going to get better
with practice.

212
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,238
She's going to Malcolm Gladwell that shit,

213
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,657
and you're going to have
an expert blowing you.

214
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,955
Ten thousand hours later,
you've got to work with her.

215
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,959
It's going to be several years.

216
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,422
But she'll get there.
I mean, I don't know.

217
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,175
Just lie...
Even if it's so bad you can't come.

218
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,593
I swear to God, even if...

219
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,012
You could be like,
"That was so good I couldn't come."

220
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,432
I'd be like, "I guess that's a thing.
I guess, cool, wow!"

221
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,852
You could tell that to me tonight,
and I just made it up, and I'd be like,

222
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,480
"I guess that thing I made up is true,
I don't know."

223
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,940
That's how bad I want to be good.

224
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,321
An innocuous compliment
from a guy you like means everything.

225
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,324
I don’t think you guys understand
what power you wield,

226
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,159
with just dumb compliments.

227
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,994
I stand before you tonight,

228
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:11,707
because I did stand-up comedy one time
fifteen years ago on a whim, I was like,

229
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,543
“I’ll try it,” and I was fine,
but a hot guy after the show was like

230
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,254
“You were great,” and I was like
“I’ll do it forever, thank you.”

231
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,635
I swear to God.

232
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:27,056
It's just...
I just needed someone to believe in me,

233
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,701
and then I look at the first time
I gave a blow job, and I’m like,

234
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:33,395
“What did that guy say?” And it was not...
It actually was the same, he was like,

235
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,606
“You should do comedy.
I mean, I'm serious.

236
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,276
This is so funny, what you think is good."

237
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,821
So...

238
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,785
I crave compliments.
I love them so much.

239
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,120
I was an ugly child.

240
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,373
So, I like, I saw the people get them
and I was like,

241
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,209
"That looks fun to experience."

242
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,378
You know?

243
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:02,049
I was diagnosed as an ugly child
at... the age of 11,

244
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,928
by a caricature artist at a Six Flags,
and...

245
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,390
I didn't know until then.

246
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,161
I really didn't, you know,
and then he turned that canvas around

247
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,938
and my dad was like, "That's great.
Oh my God, it's uncanny."

248
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,692
And my whole family was like,
"Woah! Nik, it's you."

249
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:26,490
I'm like, "Really? Okay, I didn't know
I had buck teeth and bushy eyebrows,

250
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,284
a Founding Father haircut...

251
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,120
a tiny bicycle."

252
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,709
But then, I knew.

253
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,755
Listen, I kind of had an idea
that I wasn’t that cute, you know.

254
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,799
‘Cause I had a really beautiful sister
growing up.

255
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,595
Never went through an awkward phase,
she was just so stunning.

256
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,806
She literally would stop traffic,
when I pushed her in front of it.

257
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,019
I tried to get her out of the way.

258
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,939
And I'm the second prettiest sister
and then there isn't another one, but...

259
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,233
So, I've got that, but...

260
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,695
People would stop my mom as a child

261
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,156
and tell my mom that my sister
should be a model,

262
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,284
like right in front of me, and be like,
"This child needs to be a model."

263
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,489
And they wouldn't see me at first
and then I'd emerge

264
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,580
from behind my mom's legs like <i>Nosferatu,</i>

265
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,582
like, "What should I be?"

266
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:24,048
Just like, desperate to be discovered
or whatever.

267
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,758
And they're like, "You should be...

268
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:29,219
you're going to be
a model train enthusiast, probably.

269
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,014
I think you should start collecting soon,

270
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,309
'cause you're gross."
And I was like, "Cool."

271
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,303
Whenever I see two kids
and one's cuter than the other,

272
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,230
I always tell the mom,
"Your kids are cute."

273
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,524
I make an emphasis on kids
and then I wink,

274
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,276
'cause she knows. She'll know.

275
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,239
And you can get away
with a pretty obvious wink,

276
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,604
'cause usually the ugly one
has like a lazy eye situation,

277
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,869
so they'll miss it entirely,
so you can be...

278
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,165
But just don't single out one child
as cuter than the other,

279
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,875
'cause we don't need more female comics.

280
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,920
I can't take the competition,
and that's how you make them.

281
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,925
As an ugly child, boys didn't like me.

282
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,386
I was okay with that at first.
I was just like,

283
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,223
"Good, like, I don't want their dicks
in my head, anyway, like this is perfect."

284
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:20,229
And then I hit puberty around like 22,
and I was like...

285
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,068
And at that time,
guys started to take interest

286
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:30,406
'cause I had sort of blossomed
into this like blackout drunk and...

287
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,407
they wanted in.

288
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,037
But the problem was, the second I thought
that maybe I wasn't so ugly up here,

289
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:39,748
I realized I was ugly down here.

290
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,628
I have a vagina that resembles
a hastily packed suitcase.

291
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,840
Yeah, okay.

292
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,343
I know there are some bitches

293
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,762
that are late for their flights tonight
in here, too.

294
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,141
I know you're out there.
I see you at the gym locker room.

295
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,560
I spy on you. Yes, I do.

296
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,106
There's a lot of hermit crabs
looking for new shells.

297
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,525
Out and about.

298
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,572
I know.

299
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,283
I used to feel alone.

300
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,911
I really did, 'cause you watch porn
and you're like, "Where's my vagina?"

301
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,913
That's when I realized, I was like,
"Shit...

302
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,751
That's not...
None of these look like mine. I have a..."

303
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:26,128
I felt like a young black girl
watching Disney movies.

304
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,713
I'm like, "Where's one with me in it?

305
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,883
Do you want to make one with me?"
That would have been nice.

306
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,261
"Oh, you made one with a mermaid
before making one with me. Cool.

307
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,721
That feels great."

308
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,558
But I truly...
I didn't know any other vaginas.

309
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,186
And why would I?
You don't see vaginas growing up.

310
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,869
You know? You don't even see your mom's.

311
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,065
If you do, there's a giant bush
in front of it,

312
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,192
so you don't know what her lip action is.

313
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,903
I had no idea.

314
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,115
And now, mine has to be like out,
you have to have like, here it is!

315
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,953
No hair and everything's out,
and guys make fun of vaginas like ours.

316
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,580
Don't they, girls? We hear it.

317
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,583
"Roast beef, five for $5.

318
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,628
Cold cut combo."

319
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,842
I know they look like meaty sandwiches.

320
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,385
I know.

321
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,763
We get it, and it's just like...

322
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,350
Dead on, dude. It's dead on!

323
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,104
You nailed it.
That's what it looks like and it's funny.

324
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,732
It's so funny, that's what sucks.

325
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,114
Sometimes, as a vegan,

326
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:39,952
I offend myself sometimes. I'm like,
"Meat is murder." Every time I wipe.

327
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,081
Throw paint on myself.
It's a whole process.

328
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,877
But I'm just tired of caring. It's just...

329
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,721
And I've gotten over
most of my insecurities.

330
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,340
I feel like pretty good,
'cause I've done a lot of work up here

331
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,967
and a little right here and...

332
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,470
Got something on the books
for this next week, but...

333
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,433
Little snip-a-rooney.

334
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,146
Great clips, but I...

335
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,736
I didn't masturbate my whole life, almost.

336
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,240
I didn't start masturbating till I was 28,
'cause I quit Zoloft.

337
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,451
Yeah, I was on Zoloft
for like my whole adult life,

338
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,163
and I had orgasms,
but what I thought were orgasms

339
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,791
turned out to be like
okay sneezes compared.

340
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,087
Oh my God, I had my first real orgasm
off Zoloft and I was like,

341
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,089
"Why is everyone not doing this
all the time?"

342
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,176
And so I started, all the time.
I was chronically masturbating.

343
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,305
Like, a 28-year-old woman
behaving like an 11-year-old boy, truly.

344
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,575
You know you hear these stories
from guys that are like,

345
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,934
"I did it till I bled. I didn't know."

346
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,144
I did that.

347
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,230
It was my period but it counts,
and I still count it.

348
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,109
I was... I couldn't stop.

349
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,988
I did it on a plane once
and got caught, and...

350
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,575
She saw me and I was just like,
"I thought you could in first class."

351
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,119
And she's like, "No...

352
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,250
Also, you're seated in coach
and you just walked up here,

353
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,710
so that doesn't even make sense."

354
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:15,047
And I go,
"I thought if I was beyond the curtain."

355
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,179
Masturbating now, I just am too exhausted
by all of it, you know?

356
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,640
I've too many toys. I got all the toys.

357
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,285
As soon as I started masturbating
I was like, "I gotta get that rabbit.

358
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:30,622
I've heard about this thing for a while."
So, I go to PetSmart and I get that thing,

359
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,774
and I returned it, you know?

360
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,860
I was just like,
"This thing bit my clit off!"

361
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,658
Felt good for a second, then...

362
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,035
a lot of blood, but...

363
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,454
I got too many toys.

364
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,998
And now, when I go to masturbate,
I just look at all my toys

365
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,917
in the bucket... With a bucket?

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,962
What the fuck did I just say?

367
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,505
I do not have a bucket.

368
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,633
I don't want you thinking
I'm having a bucket of dildos.

369
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,512
It's literally a ripped
Victoria's Secret bag,

370
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,472
that I keep in my closet.

371
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,977
So, I got to the old dick bucket.

372
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,901
I have so many toys, too many.

373
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,705
And every time I go to masturbate
I have to like look at all of them,

374
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,840
and I always feel bad
that I'm not using all of them.

375
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,450
I have some sort of <i>Toy Story</i> guilt
with it all.

376
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,746
I'm just like,
"Oh, Woody, you used to be my favorite.

377
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,456
I'll sit on you."

378
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,960
And I'll just sit on that,
and I'll put Buzz up here,

379
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,171
and then I got something inside me
that I'm working like this,

380
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,465
and I just... It's too much going on.

381
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,677
I always feel like a one-man band.
Eventually, I'm just like...

382
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,346
"Come on, join in, kids."

383
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,975
Like, I just feel like a town square fool.

384
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:54,646
There should be a monkey on my shoulder
with a tambourine like collecting coins

385
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,234
from passers-by like that is...
I feel like Dick Van Dyke in <i>Mary Poppins.</i>

386
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,778
That is how I feel
every single time I masturbate.

387
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,862
It's not hot.

388
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,869
Ironically enough, Dick Van Dyke

389
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:13,165
are the three words I type in
to find every porn that I look at.

390
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,420
So, I need all those elements
to really get me there.

391
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,840
My porn searches are disgusting.

392
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,843
Oh, man, those got gross, fast.

393
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,263
Listen, I know what I like.
I like bondage.

394
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,890
I'm into like getting tied up.

395
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,559
I'm into watching girls getting tied up.
I don't...

396
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,687
I’ll sell it to you, ladies,
if you’re not into it, you’re about to be.

397
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,565
Guess what? Bondage, forced laziness.

398
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,526
You don’t have to do anything to him
if you’re tied up.

399
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,821
“Oh, I want to jerk you off,
but my hands are tied.

400
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,948
Let me out!

401
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,826
No, I'm just kidding it’s fine,
just leave it. What are you doing?”

402
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,373
If there’s a ball gag in your mouth,
no dick in your head.

403
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,750
It’s just very comfortable.

404
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,796
You make it look like a struggle, like,
“Oh no! Oh!”

405
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,091
But, it’s easy breezy, man.

406
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:08,387
They blindfold you, oh my God.

407
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:12,641
And you go, “Oh no!
I can’t see you, how am I going to come?”

408
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,560
Easily. Thank you for the assist.

409
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,815
It's so good.

410
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,152
But bondage porn,
it's always like in a cellar

411
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,279
with like dripping walls.

412
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,241
Or like a warehouse,
and she's just like abandoned.

413
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,951
It's like, can't she be comfortable?

414
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,846
I don't understand why there always
has to be a guy with a welder's mask

415
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,791
and a purpose, like with a stick.
Like, can't it be nicer?

416
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,252
But it can't be,
they're always mean to her.

417
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,922
And I'm just like, "Be nice!"
Like, she's invited all these dudes over.

418
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,217
You guys... One of you showed up late,
there's nowhere for your dick to go now.

419
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,096
And so... I hate that guy.
He's always just like, "Where do I go?"

420
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,391
It's just like, "Go fill the Brita, Tony.
Why were you late?

421
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,560
Like, do something useful.

422
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,229
We're all going to be very dehydrated
after this."

423
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,733
But... no.

424
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,988
Then Tony's just like
hitting his dick on her shoulder,

425
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,699
as if that's doing anything
for either of them.

426
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:14,077
And it's just like, "Look inside yourself,
Tony. Why were you late?"

427
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,582
God!

428
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,502
She's not like a bison
on the Great Plains.

429
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:25,881
You don't need to use
every single part of her...

430
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,924
to honor her.

431
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,180
Gangbangs, like, I love gangbangs,

432
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,391
but I'm just looking
for like a respectful gangbang.

433
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,228
Like, why not just a nice...
Be nice to her.

434
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,482
A respectful gangbang,
that would just be a girl tied up,

435
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,568
and guys doing lots of things
to her down here,

436
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,403
and then up here
guys just brushing her hair

437
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,946
and telling her she's strong.

438
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,655
Respectful.

439
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,035
It's all I want.

440
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,205
You know what's frustrating
about masturbating when you're a woman,

441
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,999
is that you can't really fuck yourself,
you know?

442
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,711
Like, you can do clit stuff or whatever,
but truly, having been penetrated,

443
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,047
it's hard to do to yourself.
Like, this is...

444
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:10,759
And it is hard to come from that
if you're like doing a CrossFit sequence,

445
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,178
as you're like getting tennis elbow.

446
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,555
I mean, it's a lot of work
and I always give up.

447
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,599
And I'm just like, "This is too hard."

448
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,519
And that’s why I get so jealous of guys,
‘cause I’m like,

449
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,438
"Jerking off is so easy for guys."
It’s just this...

450
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,482
That’s so... That’s literally...

451
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,169
That’s what you do when you think...
When you say something’s easy.

452
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,913
You’re just like,
“we’ll fucking bang it out

453
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,738
and go to <i>Chipotle,</i> man. I'll just...

454
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,784
Just get the reports done,
and we’ll go to the game.”

455
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,287
Like, that's how easy that is.

456
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,373
Uh, I'm jealous.

457
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,961
'Cause I like a dick in me, I'm sorry.
I like getting stuffed.

458
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,091
I do. It feels good and I'm not going
to apologize for it.

459
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,177
I just like... But the problem is,
and people are like,

460
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,179
"Oh, then why don't you just go have sex,
Nikki.

461
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:58,848
If you want to catch a dicking,
go out and get one."

462
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,060
It's like, I would and I used to
when I drank,

463
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,813
but if you're sober
you can't just have casual sex.

464
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,958
I don't know if anyone here
has had casual sex sober,

465
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,026
but like, how did you do that?

466
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,739
Having casual sex sober, it's really...
It's a lot more intimate.

467
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:18,493
It turns into an episode of <i>Dawson's Creek</i>
for some reason.

468
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,122
A Counting Crows song starts playing.
I'm just like, "What's happening?"

469
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,040
It's like, "Round here."

470
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,209
I'm just like,
"Where is that coming from?"

471
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,670
This has meaning, when it shouldn't.

472
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:32,090
Sometimes you don't want sex
to mean anything,

473
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,509
and you just want to like bang it out
and live your life,

474
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,721
but you can't when you're sober.
When I drank, oh, that's all I did.

475
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:41,057
If I wanted to like, get dicked out,
I'd just like...

476
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,227
None of this sounds real good.
If I wanted to get...

477
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,691
I wanted to say I had had sex,
but I didn't want to experience it,

478
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,152
and that's what would be perfect.
I would just be like

479
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,030
"I feel like getting fucked."
And so, I would just blackout drink,

480
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,991
hone in on a guy and then like
kind of Cosby myself

481
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,409
into this situation where...

482
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,164
I would bepenetrated that night

483
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,292
by a comedian,
and not remember any of it.

484
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,337
I'd wake up in the morning,
I wouldn't even know what I had done.

485
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,297
And sometimes I'm like,
"Oh dear, is that...?

486
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,174
Did I do anal or is that bronzer?"

487
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:17,761
Like, I would try and figure it out,
you know those mornings?

488
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,307
Where you're like, "Did I have sex?
I don't know. I should know that."

489
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,390
I'd figure it out if the sheet
was stuck inside me.

490
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,061
I'd be like, "Okay, I probably had sex."

491
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:30,148
That's a classic post-sex
old Glase-dog move.

492
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,734
I always do a tuck, right.

493
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,777
'Cause I don't like to go to bed
with a soggy vag,

494
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,196
so I just like tuck it up.

495
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,490
I don't want to be sloshing around
all night.

496
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:42,869
And so, I tuck and release,
and I don't get yeast infections, girls.

497
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,181
Like, it's a good plan
if you don't want to get a yeasty,

498
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,247
just tuck and release,

499
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:49,000
but sometimes you're drunk
and the tuck feels so good,

500
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,084
and you just leave it,
and then it dries overnight,

501
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,089
and you gotta peel it off
like a Bioré Strip in the morning,

502
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,716
and that's... It hurts.

503
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,470
You leave behind a paper mache stalagmite
on his duvet.

504
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,807
It's not a nice way to be remembered.

505
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,227
Trying to flatten it
when he's in the bathroom.

506
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,561
I'm just like, "Go away.

507
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,689
Out, damn spot."

508
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,405
There are embarrassing moments like that,

509
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,199
but like, you know,
most of the time having drunk sex,

510
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:25,578
it made it just a lot easier to just,
to <i>get it,</i> you know?

511
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:28,057
And sometimes when I'm sober,
I got with a guy and I'm like,

512
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,041
"God, I'd love to feel that way again."

513
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,020
So, I'll just like take out one contact
lens just to feel a little off.

514
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,005
Just to be like,
"Maybe I'll make some mistakes and..."

515
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,592
It takes a lot now,
for me to want to have sex with a guy

516
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:44,431
and it's because sober sex,
it's risky, right?

517
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,308
Your body, as a woman,
when there's a penis in you,

518
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,392
and you're sober for it,

519
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,979
it like thinks you're making a baby
with the guy,

520
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,482
so it like shoots off all these chemicals,
that are just like...

521
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,193
"Remember him." You know?

522
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,071
"Hold on to him.

523
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,241
Wait for him.
He's going to provide for you."

524
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:06,536
And I just want to tell
my dumb cavewoman brain, like,

525
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,265
"I'm gonna do everything in my power
to not get pregnant right now.

526
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,750
I hope you know that,
and by that I mean the pull-out method.

527
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,002
Like, that's the best I can give you,
body."

528
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,629
And it works.
It's worked for me most the time.

529
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,798
I'm probably barren,
that's what I've determined.

530
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,508
Like, it's not supposed to work.

531
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,385
I've had one pregnancy scare.

532
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,889
It was double scary.
It was in a haunted house and I...

533
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,349
I was alarmed.

534
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,894
Yeah.

535
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,606
A woman like jumped out
in a bloody sheet and I was like,

536
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,858
"I haven't seen those in a while."
And it reminded me

537
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,528
that I hadn't ruined a sheet set
that I love in over a month.

538
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,280
So, I was like, "Oh, I should..."

539
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,286
When you use the pull-out method,

540
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,080
you sometimes need to supplement
with the morning after pill,

541
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,082
which I've taken a handful of times and...

542
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,543
No, I took a handful one time, I'm sorry.
And...

543
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,252
It's different.

544
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,255
No, the morning after pill,

545
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,800
let me just tell you though,
you can take it up to 72 hours.

546
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,469
I don't think... that's not in the name,
the Morning After.

547
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,845
They need to change the name,

548
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,823
'cause sometimes you have sex
in the morning and you're like,

549
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,493
"Okay, I've got to wait till
tomorrow morning, I guess, to take it."

550
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,228
And then you forget
and you start a family, so...

551
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,771
It's three days.

552
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,524
You have three days,
and I'm trying to get it changed

553
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,692
to the Long Weekend After the Holidays...

554
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,195
The Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday
Weekend After Pill.

555
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:25,824
I think that's... Gives you an idea
of the chunk of time you have.

556
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,910
And I'm getting a lot of pushback
from his foundation, but...

557
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,665
But you have three days,

558
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,101
and I've used them all before,
and it's not 'cause I'm like,

559
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,293
"Oh, I'm lazy."

560
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,939
It's 'cause I'm just waiting
till I need to get toilet paper, too.

561
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,299
I'm like, "I'll kill two birds or three,
twins run in my family.

562
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,718
I don't really know how this thing works,
but..."

563
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:52,308
I am willing to take it,
especially if the guy asks.

564
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,310
Have you ever had the guy
ask you to do it?

565
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:57,730
I'll always...
I'll do it, especially if he pays.

566
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,734
And I'm like,
"Yeah, if you give me fifty bucks."

567
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,235
And he does, and you go to Sephora
and you pray.

568
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,737
And that works.

569
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,703
It might cost you a little
on the back end,

570
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:16,833
but what other excuse do you have
to spend $49 on an eyeliner, so...

571
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,255
Isn't it funny when they ask you
to take the morning after?

572
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,966
I'm always just like,
"Oh my God. Yeah, I'll take it.

573
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,802
It's so cute that you think
that I want your baby.

574
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,305
Like, it's so funny that...

575
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,766
Dude, I would abort your child so soon,
like you don't even...

576
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,102
I wouldn't even call you, it's so...

577
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,438
Oh my God, huh."

578
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,166
I wouldn't think twice,
I'd just go to a clinic and be like,

579
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,910
"Hey, I slept with a guy
who wears tank tops

580
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,277
that say 'rise and grind.'"

581
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,947
And they'd be like, "In and out, ma'am.
Let's get her in. Let's go. Well...

582
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,700
We need all hands on deck for this one.

583
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,785
It's going to be on the house
for this lady."

584
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,207
Alabama would allow that one.

585
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,504
That's the one caveat they have.

586
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,342
Only in cases of tank tops
with motivational words on them.

587
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,512
"Oh, he raped you.
Never mind, you have to keep it."

588
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,183
I know, sorry, isn't the truth weird?

589
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,019
It's so weird.

590
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,815
But this is the problem...
Is I was sleeping with tank toppy guys

591
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:27,236
a lot of times... last year.
'Cause I came up with a strategy.

592
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,198
I kept sleeping with guys I liked,
'cause I liked them,

593
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,121
and then I would fall for them,
and I was like,

594
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,511
"This is a pain in the ass."
'Cause they don't text you back

595
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,055
and it's just like, uh, it's annoying.

596
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,087
I'm just tired of screenshotting
conversations

597
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,667
between men who will never love me
and myself,

598
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,461
and sending them to my friends
to be like, "What's he thinking?"

599
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,547
And they're like, "Nothing.
It's all blue, Nik.

600
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,840
Get a hold of yourself.

601
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,805
None of these are delivered,
we kind of think he blocked you, so..."

602
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,184
And so, I came up with a plan.

603
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:00,228
I was like,
"Oh, I'll only have sex with guys

604
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,551
who I would never want to love"

605
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,898
Right, then I'll never like want them
to be my boyfriend.

606
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:10,279
So, I pick a guy with like a necklace,
right, like a dangly outer necklace.

607
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:14,909
Not an inside one,
'cause you can't ever predict those.

608
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,328
Girls, we've all slept with guys
with necklaces,

609
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,540
where we didn't know it was there
until we got naked with them,

610
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,208
and then you see it and you're like,

611
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,210
"Okay...

612
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,844
I feel like I wouldn't be doing this
right now if I knew that was there.

613
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,260
I really feel a little bit hoodwinked
by you at this moment, but...

614
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,930
our shirts are off, so...

615
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,850
I've got to at least blow you
or something. Great.

616
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,184
Them's the rules."

617
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,939
So, I go after a guy
with like an active necklace and...

618
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,900
Which is good, though,
because during the sex

619
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,610
it's like hanging over you,

620
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:52,864
like swaying back and forth
as a reminder...

621
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,075
that he's not to be loved...

622
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,121
and/or respected, right?

623
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,165
It's right there.

624
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,208
And you feel good.

625
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:09,130
And they always have a dumb reason
for their necklace, too.

626
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,923
It infuriates me.

627
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:15,428
"It's my grandfather's dog tags.
Hold it close."

628
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,389
I'm just like, "Okay, good,
at least the spirit of a real man

629
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,266
will be hovering over me tonight."

630
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,895
That's a plus, I guess.

631
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:29,692
Someone who actually fought for something
other than a parking spot at <i>GameStop.</i>

632
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,034
So, I slept with a necklace guy,
and I feel good.

633
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,439
The next day, I would feel good.

634
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,705
I would have like
a little whore's skip in my step.

635
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:45,833
Like, "I just banged,
and I don't even care if I hear from him.

636
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,668
Like, I'm a Samantha.

637
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,380
We do exist, right"

638
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,551
And then I'm in line at Starbucks,
and I'm just like waiting,

639
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:59,180
and I let my thoughts go, I don't know,
three thoughts too far,

640
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,348
and I'm just like...

641
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:07,230
"I love his necklace.
Like I... love necklaces,

642
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,816
and I love him for wearing
that stupid necklace.

643
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:12,276
Like, I made fun of him for that necklace,

644
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,040
and I think it's the worst thing
about him,

645
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,830
I think it might be the best thing
about him,

646
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,033
because like his necklace...
I made fun of reasons for necklaces,

647
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,994
but his is actually good,
like he went to <i>Aéropostale,</i>

648
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,247
it was on sale and he liked it.
So, like...

649
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,000
That's a legit good reason.

650
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,813
Oh my God, I wonder where
I'm going to store my necklace

651
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,297
when I move in with him?
Like, I wonder where...

652
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,174
If he has like a necklace tree.

653
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:40,179
Oh my God, I bet when he's ready for me
to move in with him,

654
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,682
he'll like clean a branch
off the necklace tree.

655
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,352
And we'll be in bed
on like a Sunday morning,

656
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,315
and he'll be like,
'Go check the necklace tree.'

657
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:51,274
I'm going to be like,
'Why? We're in bed. I wanna cuddle.'

658
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,568
He's like, 'Just go check the tree.'
And I'm like...

659
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:59,282
'You're being weird.'

660
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,578
And then I go and there's like a ring
on one of the branches.

661
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:04,661
It's like...

662
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:09,876
'Oh my God, I can't believe I'm moving
to Fort Worth, like, this is insane.'"

663
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:14,963
And then, I'm done.

664
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,342
And then, I'm in love with a guy
who's not going to text me back,

665
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,720
'cause he knew the rules,
and it's just like...

666
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,306
It's not worth my time anymore,
so I've just...

667
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,183
No more penises in me.

668
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,767
That's my new rule. No more.

669
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:31,647
And it sucks 'cause sex,
now that that's off the table,

670
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:33,024
man, what do I have?

671
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,775
That was the one thing I was good at.

672
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,421
If I would hook up with the guy,
I would go right from making out,

673
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,645
and I'd be like, "Let's fuck."

674
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,616
And it wasn't cause I like,
"Loved a dick in me."

675
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,909
I'm just like,
"This is the easiest thing to do."

676
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,536
And I'm good at it.

677
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,789
I like doing things I'm good at.
Girls like doing things they're good at.

678
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,500
I am great at getting fucked.

679
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,836
I just am, and I know that's braggy,

680
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,714
but I was just born with the ability
to kick back

681
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,008
and have a hole, like, I just like...

682
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,177
lean into it.

683
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,513
And as a whole, I think...

684
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,227
As a whole as a hole,

685
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:14,106
I think it is by far our best option
to get you off, is having sex.

686
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,834
It's the easiest.
I never understand when girls are like,

687
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,337
"No, I didn't have sex with him.
We did everything except sex."

688
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:21,280
I'm like, "Are you exhausted?
Why would you do all the hard stuff?

689
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,658
What's in it for you?"

690
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:30,206
Sex at least, like, if you have sex
it's going to feel good.

691
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,500
You could come, you know?

692
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:38,589
You won't, probably,
like most of the time you don't,

693
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,967
but it's like on the table, right?

694
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,471
Our options to get you off,
just are like...

695
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,933
They're not great,
and we have to get you off.

696
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,560
We do, right, girls?
You have to get a guy off,

697
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,146
'cause we all learned about blue balls,
right?

698
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,608
I grew up in a generation of women
who went through a course

699
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,069
similar to the <i>DARE</i> program
about blue balls,

700
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:05,908
in which we learned
that it is our duty to get you off,

701
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,119
if you think you're going to get off,
you know?

702
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,579
If you make a guy hard, it's...

703
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:15,376
You have to see it through
or you're like a selfish cunt.

704
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,459
Like, you...

705
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,516
Why did you make him hard then,
if you didn't want to make him come?

706
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,465
So, do it, you know?

707
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,761
If you build it, he must come.
You know the rules.

708
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,141
Finish what you started.
Clean Plate Club

709
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,600
You get all these...

710
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,894
Like, "I will."

711
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,772
And I certainly will,
because blue balls is a pain.

712
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,774
It's a severe pain
that I could inflict on a man

713
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,067
by not blowing him.

714
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,652
That's so mean.

715
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,656
And the pain, apparently, girls,
we can't even understand it.

716
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,617
We can't. Physiologically our bodies

717
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,329
are not made to understand
that kind of pain,

718
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:57,251
but I can guess the closest we can get
is like maybe a spinal fracture,

719
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,253
or like a gunshot wound.

720
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,631
That's kind of in that range. So you go,

721
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,593
"Oh my God, I don't want to make
this guy feel that pain."

722
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,095
This guy that I don't really even like
that much.

723
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,240
So, you blow him or you fuck him,
'cause you're like,

724
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,975
"I don't want you to be in pain.
Here's the antidote."

725
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:18,230
And then you find out it's not a pain
and that's a bunch of bullshit.

726
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,609
It's not a pain. It's a feeling, for sure.

727
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,779
It's a feeling, and I will validate that.
It is just like a...

728
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,200
"I want to.

729
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,536
Please, but I want to!

730
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,164
Mom!

731
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,125
It's not fair!

732
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,421
He got to come!"

733
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,759
That's it. That's the feeling.

734
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,182
I know, and you can't act that way either,
'cause you're a man,

735
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,643
you know, or at least
you're dressed like one, so...

736
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,271
You have to like bottle up
that intense anger,

737
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,816
and it must be annoying,
and I get it, I've felt that way.

738
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:05,111
I've not come before,
like almost exclusively,

739
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,487
so I understand...

740
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,324
cranky clit or whatever it is to me.

741
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,620
I felt that frustration and it sucks.

742
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:18,958
And you feel it as a girl,
if you don't make a guy come,

743
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,127
and you give him blue balls
or whatever that is,

744
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,837
you feel it the next day.

745
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,382
Girls, you ever spend the night in a bed
with a guy and not touch his dick?

746
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,301
The next morning,
the energy will have shifted in the room.

747
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:33,347
There's just a palpable anger,
that even he is not aware of,

748
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:38,769
but he's tying his shoes kind of loud
and you're like, "Ah! Yikes!"

749
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:41,230
He will have brought you to his place
in an Uber black,

750
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,482
but then you're going home
in a Lyft Share.

751
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,360
I mean, things have taken a turn.

752
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,780
So, you just make guys come.

753
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,544
Like you're just like,
"I'll make him come,

754
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,742
'cause I just don't want to hurt him.

755
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,746
I don't want them to be mad at me.
I don't want them to feel bad or sad,

756
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,708
so I'll just fucking... Here, take a come.

757
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,876
You can have a come."

758
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:05,087
I was doling out comes
all through my twenties.

759
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:07,173
Gave away so many comes,

760
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:09,758
and then I came up with a way
to like stop giving out comes,

761
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,677
which is I just wouldn't touch
their penises.

762
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,240
'Cause if you don't touch their penis

763
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,024
then you don't have to do
anything about it.

764
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,892
That's a trick I learned,
it's like, if you touch their hard dick,

765
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,768
it's like inviting a vampire
in your house,

766
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,314
like you're obligated
to then do something about it,

767
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,108
or whatever that rule is.

768
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,795
But you can avoid touching their dick.

769
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,921
At the end of a date,
I always keep my hands up here,

770
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,841
'cause I'm just trying to figure out
if I want to touch their dick or not.

771
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,659
But I'm just keeping them up here
and kind of keeping my space.

772
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,704
'Cause I haven't decided,
maybe I do want to touch your dick.

773
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,623
I don't know yet.
I'm trying to figure it out.

774
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:42,374
I probably... It's always between,

775
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,628
"Oh, do I go home with him
or go home and eat?"

776
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:50,132
Like, that's usually kind of the battle
in a woman's mind.

777
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,220
Especially me, like,
if I'm nervous about a date,

778
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,179
I usually haven't like eaten enough
that day,

779
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:58,074
'cause I'm scared we're gonna have sex
and I don't wanna fart during it,

780
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,184
so I've like just been like...

781
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,187
So, I'm starving at this point
and I'm just like,

782
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,354
"I'm just going to go home."

783
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,997
But sometimes, they like...
They get frustrated and they're like,

784
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,292
"Maybe she doesn't know I'm hard."

785
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,920
I think that sometimes you guys are like,
"Maybe she doesn't know."

786
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,144
So, they'll take your hand
and kind of Helen Keller you,

787
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,796
"Hey, I'm hard right..."
And you're like,

788
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,450
"Oh, thank you, papa." Like, I just...

789
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,911
I don't know why 'papa'.

790
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:22,331
That doesn't fit either scenario,
but we had fun.

791
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,670
But then you touch it,
and I do like a hot stove now, I'm like,

792
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,297
"I didn't touch it,
so I don't have to do anything."

793
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:34,552
Cause if you don't touch,
you can just kind of go, "Goodnight."

794
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:39,890
And like, float away on a toadstool,
and like, go home and eat in bed.

795
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,309
And then...
But then, if you touch it, you have to...

796
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,479
You either have to do something to it,
or you have to tell him

797
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:49,358
that you don't want to do anything
with it at this point, right?

798
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,526
And you're just like,

799
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,945
"I just don't like you enough now,
or I'm not comfortable."

800
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:56,240
It's like a hard conversation
to kind of have and sometimes...

801
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,828
I'm better at sucking dick
than I am at sharing my true feelings.

802
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,790
And so, I blow a guy
to avoid telling him the truth.

803
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,543
I've done it so many times.

804
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,753
But...

805
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,132
I just...

806
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,135
For me to make you come now,
I just like...

807
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,762
If I'm not having sex,
that used to be my go-to.

808
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,286
Now, I'm like, "I have to blow you?"

809
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,684
And I'm still not confident
in my blow jobs and I was...

810
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,103
I'm trying to get better,

811
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,106
but recently I gave one,
and 90 seconds in,

812
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,951
the same thing happened
that always happens,

813
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:36,196
the guy just kind of held my head steady
and decided to fuck it himself, you know?

814
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:40,200
Kind of took over and and treated my head
like a bird house.

815
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,954
That's how I got through it,
is pretending I'm a birdhouse.

816
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:51,003
I just... I have no rhythm.
I have no natural rhythm.

817
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:52,588
And so, I actually was like,

818
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,882
"Thank you, take the wheel.
I don't know what you want."

819
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,179
I just don't have a good sense of rhythm.
I may be able to show you a good time,

820
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,599
if you've like a metronome
on your nightstand, but it's just not...

821
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:07,478
Most girls do not like
when you grab their head

822
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:11,899
and just hold it and fuck it,
but I truly appreciate the gesture and...

823
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,610
'Cause then I can focus
on what I'm actually good at,

824
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,154
which is going to be
surviving this blow job,

825
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:21,575
because my breathing
is now up to you, good sir.

826
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,288
'Cause you don't seem to understand
that I can't breathe

827
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,207
when your dick is in my head.

828
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:33,754
So, I hope you let me get
a couple gasps in here and there.

829
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,341
I always feel like I'm lost at sea
when I'm sucking dick,

830
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:39,927
and I'm just like emerging like,

831
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,055
"Coast guard!"
And just getting sucked back under.

832
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,099
I've got to time them perfectly.

833
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,103
And I'm good at breathing
during blow jobs,

834
00:44:49,186 --> 00:44:51,456
'cause I didn't know guys didn't know
we couldn't breathe,

835
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,235
but we can't breathe
when your dick is in our head.

836
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,946
I have to get it through to you.
I know you think we can,

837
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,825
because of our nose. You're like,
"Your nostrils don't have dicks in them."

838
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,036
Like, clearly it's an open passage.

839
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,706
It's the only way to shut off
a girl's breathing.

840
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,874
Let me tell you that it's from within.

841
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,061
I don't know what's happening,
but when the dick's your head,

842
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,522
you can't breathe through your nose.
You can't... It's like an inside job.

843
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,881
You can't... I can't explain,
but it's all getting clogged.

844
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,342
It doesn't take a big dick.
It doesn't take deepthroat.

845
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:23,637
It's just all...
And it's rarely deepthroat by the way.

846
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,032
I just want to just briefly tell you
that when you think...

847
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,267
I don't know... Sometime you just go,
"Take it."

848
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,687
You know, you jam it
and it's not like drain snaking its way

849
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,647
gently down our esophagus like...

850
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:38,026
Like a boomerang of a lady
going down a waterslide.

851
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,447
Like, "Oh, so fun. Easy does it."

852
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:47,578
No, it's jamming into the back...
It's crumpling into our soft palate.

853
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,048
I'm like,
"Does he know this is a cul-de-sac?

854
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,167
Like, there's no way through."

855
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,006
Drive like your kids live here, like,
take it slow, dude.

856
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,761
He's punching in the...
Ramming the back of your head. It hurts.

857
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,513
It feels like you're trying
to punch through

858
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,515
like a game on <i>The Price is Right.</i>

859
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,852
It's so aggressive and it hurts.

860
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,188
It really does hurt.

861
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,666
And I don't know if you guys can't tell
'cause you can't see,

862
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,526
but start to look,
you'll be able to tell just by just...

863
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,822
It's a little thing we do, like,
the tears streaming down our face.

864
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,911
Thick tears,
just like an elephant who lost a friend.

865
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,621
Like those, just kind of like...

866
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,587
That could be an indication.

867
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,547
I couldn't be...

868
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:45,469
I guess I wouldn't have known that,
you know, you can't breath if a dick's

869
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,596
in your head,
had I not been on the receiving end.

870
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,891
I don't know, maybe I wouldn't have,
but I'm here to tell you we can't.

871
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,203
And I found out guys didn't know
that we couldn't breathe

872
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,347
from watching a porn.
Not even from my own experience.

873
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,606
I saw this guy,
and he was using this girl's head

874
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:59,608
as a <i>fleshlight,</i> pretty aggressively.

875
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:02,694
And he did the thing where he was like,
"Take it all."

876
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:07,324
And he... 'Cause he was mad at his Mom.
Clearly, it was something to do with her.

877
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,327
She didn't pick him up from school
a couple times

878
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:11,471
and she said she was going
to make an effort to do so,

879
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,641
and she was late and it was embarrassing,
and so, he's taking it out on Savannah,

880
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,333
and she had nothing to do with it.

881
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:19,670
I mean, it was in the 80s,
well before she was born and so...

882
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:22,129
So he's...

883
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,049
"Take it, bitch."

884
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,153
And he's holding her there for a while,
and I was holding my breath with her,

885
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,721
'cause I was like, "I got you, girl.
I know you can't breathe.

886
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:33,684
Solidarity. Neighborhood Watch.
Like, I am on it."

887
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:35,018
So, I'm watching...

888
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,983
and it's about a minute in and I'm like,
"This girl's a pro. This is incredible.

889
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,569
She must deep sea dive
or some shit like that.

890
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,320
This is awesome."

891
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:48,866
And then, I saw him see her struggle.

892
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,660
And he goes, "Oh, you think that's bad?
What about now?"

893
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:55,163
And he plugged her nose to be like,
"Take it to the next level."

894
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:56,874
I'm like, "This fucking idiot."

895
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,502
First of all, that is the most worthless,
like, "What about now?"

896
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,546
He should have been like,
"What about now?"

897
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:05,424
And added like
a fun Mardi Gras mask flourish,

898
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,968
that would have been
a more interesting challenge.

899
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:12,431
Than this, which you're already doing.

900
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,601
So I was like, "Oh my God,
if this guy thinks she can't breathe now."

901
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,562
Like, I'm about to watch her die,
you know?

902
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:23,191
So I came really hard, and I go back to it
and I check in on her and I go...

903
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,238
She survived.
I'm happy to tell you she lived.

904
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,326
'Cause she knew, and she's smart,
and she did her safe word

905
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,569
to get out of that,
which worked out before which is...

906
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,830
And it's so...

907
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,085
It's the correct pronunciation.
I don't know how to spell it, but it is...

908
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,588
I think it's Yiddish, but it's...

909
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,846
That's like a hot sound now,
isn't that weird?

910
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:55,766
Porn has made that like a sex sound.

911
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,060
It used to...
Porn sounds used to be like...

912
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,686
And now they're...

913
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,609
It's that pervasive in porn. It's wild.

914
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,529
I guarantee you
there are at least 14 dudes in here

915
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,293
with blood rushing
to your dicks right now.

916
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:15,327
Just based on Pavlov's dick response,
of just like...

917
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,791
"Is a girl getting choked by a dick
somewhere? What's happening?"

918
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,753
And I know you feel bad about it.
It feels weird to be turned on by that,

919
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,089
but it's okay,
you just watch too much porn, it's fine.

920
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:28,507
It's like, it's not gonna be fine

921
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,760
when a woman is actually choking
at a restaurant where you're...

922
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,638
dining with your wife.

923
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,099
And a woman's at the next table like...

924
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,477
Your wife is like,
"You know Heimlich. Give it to her."

925
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,939
And you're like, "I can't, I have a boner,
and I don't want to put it in her back

926
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,150
as I save her life,
so I'd rather she just like die."

927
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,114
So, that'll be weird, but until then...

928
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:56,326
It's just all these things.
I'm willing to do all of this, by the way.

929
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,622
So happy to do it. I like when guys come.

930
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,583
It's like, it makes me feel good
when they come. I'm not...

931
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,752
I never want to be a comedian
who's up here like,

932
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,379
"Fucking men." You know?

933
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,049
I would love to be up here fucking men,
that's a different thing. That's a...

934
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:15,929
It's a show I aspire to put on
for you someday, but...

935
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,764
Building towards that.

936
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,101
But I just...
I am willing to do all this stuff.

937
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:24,062
It's like... And I want you to come,
and...

938
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,232
'Cause, girls, we like when guys come.
We really do.

939
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,444
Like, it means we can get
on our phones sooner, so it's like...

940
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:33,280
"Oh, good.
He did that, and back on Instagram."

941
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,743
But I just can't give away any more comes.

942
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:41,747
I just can't anymore. I'm 35,
and I just...

943
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,958
I don't know, if I...
I think I just know my worth more.

944
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:46,251
I have value,

945
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,670
and like for me to suck your dick,
like it's...

946
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,923
It's like a thousand bucks.
Like, I don't know, like you can Venmo me,

947
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,675
or we'll...

948
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,344
Hooking up now is just...
It's very complicated for me,

949
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,931
because I'm just plagued
by this obligation to get you off,

950
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:03,101
that I can't even enjoy
what you do to me anymore,

951
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,021
'cause I'm like,
"What am I going to do to him." You know?

952
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,439
I get fingered and I'm just like,

953
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:10,233
"What am I going to be willing
to take after this?"

954
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,087
It's like when you're in grade school
and you give your friends...

955
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:15,715
You're like, "Let's massage each other"
And you're doing back rubs.

956
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,699
The whole time, I'm like,
"I can't even like this,

957
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,910
'cause I've got to rub this bitch next,
like..."

958
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,496
That's what it feels like,
hooking up with you.

959
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,456
Every single one of you.

960
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,220
And so,
I think I've figured something out.

961
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:29,086
The best hook up scenario I can imagine,

962
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:32,273
and I think you guys will like this, too,
is that I get fingered to completion,

963
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:35,759
and then I get out of the Uber.

964
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,260
And I feel like that...

965
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,471
I'll tip you.

966
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,056
I'll throw a tip on there

967
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,600
the next time I pull up the app.
I know how to do it.

968
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,644
Please.

969
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,566
I would love that to be
a part of the Uber app, Uber finger.

970
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,945
It just... It's like you pay more,
you pay double,

971
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,905
'cause it's like,
it's a two-man operation.

972
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,866
We can't have our drivers
fingering the passengers.

973
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,953
So, there's a guy in the back seat,
it's not even a guy, it's maybe a girl.

974
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,476
You don't know, he's wearing a mask.

975
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,540
They don't...
They're not allowed to talk to you.

976
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,041
He's maybe dressed like a minion.

977
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,837
It's a tie-in with Sony
for a promotional stunt. I don't know...

978
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,172
We're still working out the kinks.

979
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:16,800
It's in beta, but...

980
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:19,636
Yeah, it's a two-man op.

981
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,763
It has to be a two-man op,
you're going to pay extra

982
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,391
until there's self-driving cars, right,
and then...

983
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:29,604
As soon as there are self-fingering cars,
I mean, you'll never hear from me again.

984
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,481
Truly... I'll be gone.

985
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:34,693
I'd be a real road dog after that.

986
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:41,283
It does take a lot for me
to want to do anything to a guy now,

987
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,993
'cause I just can't, you know?

988
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:43,994
And I would.

989
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:46,621
I would love to, just, I need...

990
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:50,292
And I bristle at even saying this word,
but I need more foreplay.

991
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:54,337
And I hate saying that,
I never wanted to be a female comic

992
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,007
who said,
"More foreplay. We need more foreplay."

993
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:02,012
I like... I looked at sitcoms in the 90s.
I saw housewives on those shows be like,

994
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:05,307
"Well, if he had more foreplay."
I just heard foreplay and I'm like,

995
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,101
"You should never ask for more foreplay,
guys hate it."

996
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,521
Because I hear audience members go like,
"Boo, foreplay!"

997
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:12,814
And the dudes would be like...

998
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,150
And then the girls would be like,
"Tee-he, we relate."

999
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,033
And then they'd get beat
on the car ride home,

1000
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,447
so I was like, "Okay,
I'm never going to demand foreplay."

1001
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:23,283
I'd never had sex, but I'm like,
"This foreplay thing,

1002
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,206
I'm going to let it slide.
I don't give a shit.

1003
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,370
Stick it in dry.
Pay me $0.80 on the dollar.

1004
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,665
I should just be happy this guy wants
to stick his dick in my ugly head."

1005
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,667
I truly believed that.

1006
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,395
I was like, "I'm never gonna complain
about foreplay."

1007
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,923
And then I started hooking up
and I'm like, "We need more foreplay."

1008
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:41,009
Hand me a fucking blazer
with shoulder pads in it,

1009
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:44,095
and give me some high-waisted jeans,
frizz-out my hair,

1010
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:46,514
'cause we need more foreplay.
Like, I just...

1011
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,684
I'm with those 90s bitches now.

1012
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,729
You didn't listen.
I don't understand what to tell you.

1013
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:56,274
I have been fingered when I'm dry
so many times this year,

1014
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,110
it is truly an act of terrorism.

1015
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:02,113
I am so sick of it.

1016
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,284
You should not ever finger a dry vagina.
Ever!

1017
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,744
It should never happen.

1018
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,932
When you get fingered, when you're dry,
as a woman, it's the same as if we took

1019
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,167
your limp dick,
and we were just like, "Come on."

1020
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:18,088
We would never do that to you.

1021
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:23,510
I don't even look at a limp dick.
Like, I wouldn't touch one.

1022
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:26,221
I don't look at one,
'cause I know you're not proud of it.

1023
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,516
So, I'm like, "I won't look at it
until he's ready for me to see it,

1024
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,726
and to meet it, okay." So...

1025
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:36,856
I treat it like your wedding dress.
I'm just like, "I'll let him show it to me

1026
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,609
when he's ready,
for good luck or whatever the hell."

1027
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:44,948
I never look at a limp dick,
and I'm dying to play with a limp dick.

1028
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,742
I would love it.
But I don't even let myself.

1029
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,078
I don't get to,
because I respect your boundaries.

1030
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:53,415
But if I could, oh, I'd do this,
and I'd stretch it.

1031
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:55,959
You can stretch it and it does...

1032
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,169
They don't care, until they wake up

1033
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,463
and they're like,
"Hey, will you cut it out?"

1034
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,174
It's so fun.

1035
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,884
They're so fun.

1036
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:06,469
Oh my God.

1037
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,930
But I'm serious, guys,

1038
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,892
like you got to cut it out
with the dry fingering. It's truly...

1039
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:15,437
It's devastating. It sucks.

1040
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:19,399
And I've tried different ways
to avoid getting fingered while dry.

1041
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,776
That's why my pants
keep getting higher and higher,

1042
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,487
as I'm building in more track time for me,

1043
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,906
when you're on your way down,
to make myself wet.

1044
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,326
I'm just like, "Get wet.
Get wet for the summer. Get wet."

1045
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:34,122
And I never do, you always get down there,
and then I hear a squeak,

1046
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:37,751
and I'm like,
"Fuck, he thinks I'm menopausal."

1047
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:41,225
I've gone as far as like,
if I know a guy is going to be worthless,

1048
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:44,883
I'll finger myself on the cab ride
to dinner with him.

1049
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,761
Just to get a nice sheen going
before we break bread.

1050
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,596
I don't trust you anymore.

1051
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,142
Yeah, sometimes,
guys when they spit on you,

1052
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,186
it's like almost insulting,

1053
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:58,938
because sometimes I work so hard
to get myself wet,

1054
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:01,358
and I want to like show it off,
and sometimes guys will...

1055
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,485
Like, just do that and I'm like, "Umm..."

1056
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:06,863
Don't salt your food before you try it.
Like can you at least like...

1057
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:14,079
Respect the chef, like, I...

1058
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,669
Oh God. I asked my friend the other day,
I'm like,

1059
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,065
"What do you do for foreplay
when you hook up with a girl?"

1060
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,800
And he's like, "I don't know,
I really like fucking on the couch.

1061
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,301
I think that's pretty cool."

1062
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:31,804
Okay.

1063
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,722
That's what they think.

1064
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:36,643
They think as long as
it's out of the bedroom, that counts.

1065
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:40,021
Fully penetrating a woman on a couch.

1066
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:42,439
Foreplay.

1067
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:45,485
No, foreplay is... It's simple.

1068
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,029
It's kissing. It's compliments.

1069
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,573
It's going to therapy. It's just...

1070
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,826
Work on yourself.

1071
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:56,913
Whisper in my ear that you're ready
to address your anger with your dad,

1072
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,996
and I'll fucking...

1073
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:02,544
You'll get an alert on your phone
about a flash flood, I'll get wet so fast.

1074
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,881
"Evacuate caves!" Like I...

1075
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:11,636
I can get wet. I just... Dry humping.

1076
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:14,347
Man, I get turned on
just thinking about dry humping.

1077
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,017
I could ride a knee
into the goddamn sunset.

1078
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,853
Give me a knee.

1079
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:28,236
A knee clad in denim
and I can just get up on it.

1080
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:33,158
Like Don Quixote up in this bitch.
I love dry humping.

1081
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,077
I want to invent a move
called The Reverse Santa,

1082
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,401
where a girl just... You get...

1083
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,540
They face you sitting down,
you get on their knee. You grind it out.

1084
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,059
You tell them what you want
for Christmas.

1085
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:45,211
They call you a good girl,
and then you take a picture. And that's...

1086
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:49,924
Coming to a mall near you
this holiday season.

1087
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:51,592
That's what I want.

1088
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,391
Just do stuff to us that isn't our vagina.

1089
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:02,270
Like just keep it dry before it's wet.
I think dry humping's great.

1090
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:06,191
We all are wearing jeans now, like this,
that have like a seam...

1091
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:09,861
Right where the seams meet
there's like a bump.

1092
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,738
It's called a clit nobbin.

1093
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:17,660
That's the name that <i>Levi Strauss</i> gave it
in his blueprints for the original 501s.

1094
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:23,124
But that's good, you use that and just...
That's a huge bump there.

1095
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,375
He put it a little low,

1096
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,545
'cause every guy thinks your clit
is like where your hole is.

1097
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,875
Just like, "Oh, he thought it was where
the hole is."

1098
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,674
So, you've got to hike it up, but..

1099
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,676
And it is hard to locate a clit.

1100
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,095
I don't mean to like judge a guy
for not knowing.

1101
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,341
Sometimes I look down there,

1102
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,641
"I don't know where the fuck
that thing is hiding today."

1103
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:44,479
Keep a little post it on it now,
it's easy to locate but...

1104
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:49,442
You got to be sucking clit.
Do you guys know about that?

1105
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:52,070
Clit stuff's important,
and sucking clit is where it's at.

1106
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,280
I didn't know anything about sucking clit.

1107
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,450
I would have done the same thing
that you guys do when you go down on us.

1108
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,620
If I went down on a girl
I would have done the same style.

1109
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:05,041
I would just rub my face in it
until I hit something, like, that's good.

1110
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,044
I like that. Keep that. I do enjoy it.

1111
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:11,714
It's like when I play video games,
I like press all the buttons and I win.

1112
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:15,176
I'm just like, just same logic.

1113
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:20,139
However, you got to be sucking clit.
Let me tell you about this.

1114
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:23,977
I didn't even know about sucking clit
until I got sent a toy that did it for me.

1115
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,729
This woman had heard me talk a lot
about how I...

1116
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,608
For me to have an orgasm,
I need like a lot of pressure, peer.

1117
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:31,775
And so...

1118
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,863
She's like, "You need the Womanizer."
And I was like,

1119
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,866
"Yeah, I've been trying to slide
into John Mayer's DMs for a while now."

1120
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:42,370
And I was like, "He writes, LOL
and then he just kind of peters off."

1121
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,497
And she's like,
"No, I'm talking about a tool."

1122
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:48,126
And I was like, "Yeah, so am I,
but I guess he's...

1123
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,336
I like some of his songs and..."

1124
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,628
So...

1125
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,592
we had a little back and forth,
a little who's on first.

1126
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,220
And then she sent me this toy
and it blew my mind,

1127
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,532
because you put it over your clit
and it sucks your clit.

1128
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,642
It has three settings,
it's low, medium, squirt and then it...

1129
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,812
I swear to you, you can squirt.

1130
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:12,191
I didn't think I could
and now I know I can do anything. Like...

1131
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:15,069
We can do anything.

1132
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,072
I never could squirt and I wanted to,

1133
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:20,366
'cause I think it's such
a cool power move.

1134
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:24,037
Like, just to just dump a quart of water
on a guy's bed and be like, "Peace."

1135
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:27,206
And just like,
"Catch you on the flip, dude." Like...

1136
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,585
Nothing cooler than that to me.

1137
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:35,214
No, it's like sucking clit makes sense,
dude, it really does.

1138
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,925
Because clits and penises
are pretty much the same thing,

1139
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,260
like the same nerve endings.

1140
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,655
So, what you really need to treat it like,
is like go down on a girl

1141
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,391
and suck her clit like you would
a tiny version of your penis, okay?

1142
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,061
I know that feels weird to say
and to even do,

1143
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,313
but I swear to God, if you go down there

1144
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:53,399
and you just treat her clit
like you would your tiny little penis,

1145
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,401
and you suck that tiny little penis...

1146
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,362
you're gay.

1147
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,865
You're so gay!
That's the gayest shit I ever heard.

1148
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,200
Why would you do that?

1149
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:06,828
Dude.

1150
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,625
No, it's fucking great. Do it.
Please, do it.

1151
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,878
That's the best.

1152
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,127
So, when you...
So, next time you go down on a girl,

1153
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:19,926
I'm not kidding you, find her clit
and you latch onto that thing

1154
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:23,763
like a barnacle on an old boat.
I swear to you.

1155
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,686
Just latch on and don't let go
until the captain sprays you off.

1156
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:30,895
'Cause she's gonna.

1157
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,481
Oh, she's gonna.

1158
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,985
And then, you swallow. No, don't do that.

1159
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:41,239
You'll drown.

1160
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:43,700
That would be cool.

1161
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,202
And I'm like, "Take it all."

1162
01:01:49,747 --> 01:01:50,747
He's like...

1163
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,336
Is that feminism?

1164
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:58,172
I think I just stumbled upon feminism.

1165
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,635
Thank you guys very much.

1166
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,678
You're fucking rad.

1167
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,471
Thank you for...

1168
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:09,726
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you for being here.

1169
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,936
I love you.
Thank you for watching at home.

1170
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:13,146
