00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,320
[bell ringing]

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,960
[horn honks]

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,720
[audience cheering and applauding]

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
[cheering and applause continues]

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,200
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please welcome to the stage</i>

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,760
<i>Michael McIntyre!</i>

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,880
[cheering and applause intensifies]

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,400
[Michael] Bravo!

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,800
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,400
Welcome...

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,680
[Michael laughs]

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,600
...to my Netflix special!

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,520
Let's do this!

14
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,080
Thank you!

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,480
[cheering and applause continues]

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,240
If I'm honest with you,
I wanted to be in slightly better...

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,640
physical condition

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,959
-[laughing] for... f-for the special.
-[laughter]

19
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600
[laughs] I planned on it,

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,280
but, you know, it's not really happened.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,760
I wouldn't have mentioned it,
it's just that this suit was cut

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,440
bespokely for my body about a year ago,

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,320
and it's not a body I have anymore,
unfortunately.

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,200
It's got a little clingy, a bit tuggy.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,360
I've found I have to express myself,

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,560
gesticulate, below this line.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,240
You'll see mostly
I'll need to express myself

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,080
down here tonight,

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,880
because, when I raise my arms beyond that,

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,160
this has started.

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,080
[laughter]

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,680
Jacket boobs, ladies and gentlemen.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,200
[applause]

34
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,400
An incredibly unfortunate side effect

35
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,080
of the tight jacket.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,080
I've got a bit chubby cheek, chubby cheek.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,320
I've got the old chubby cheeks
going on at the moment.

38
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,880
Um... [smacks lips]

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
Unfortunately,
due to the chubby cheek situation,

40
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,880
um, a few problems.

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,560
I got a phone, um,

42
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,440
I don't know when it was,
about a year ago.

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,360
The new iPhone. It's got Face ID.

44
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,280
When you first get it, you look at it,

45
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,840
it maps your face,
and then it remembers you.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,720
Every time you look at it,
it becomes unlocked.

47
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,720
Not from a code, just from your face.

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,760
Well, now my phone no longer recognizes...

49
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
-my fat face.
-[laughter]

50
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,600
Just stares at me as if to say,
"Who's that fat thief?

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,480
Have you stolen Michael's phone?"

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,800
-[laughter]
-I can unlock it, but I have to do this.

53
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,200
-Mmm. Mmm.
-[laughter]

54
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
[chuckles]

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,240
It's 'cause I'm getting older, you see.
My wife and I, we're the same age.

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,360
Little things have started changing.
For years, everything was the same,

57
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,800
but now we can feel it creeping in.

58
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,040
It's not exactly old age,
but little... little differences.

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
For example, we can't stay up at night.

60
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,560
-We... We pass out.
-[laughter]

61
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,280
Every single--
About 9:30 is a late one for us.

62
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,720
-[laughter]
-We get so tired.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,960
You know when you click
on the Netflix thing

64
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,680
and it goes "boom-boom"?

65
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,680
That's the sound of my wife and I's head
hitting the pillow and passing out.

66
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,840
We can't get beyond it.

67
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,040
-[laughter and applause]
-[Michael chuckles]

68
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,280
[cheering]

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Another thing
that's started happening now...

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,280
which, I have to say,
I'm not proud of this.

71
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,960
I'm actually very disappointed

72
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,720
that this has happened
so young in my life.

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
It's not happening every night.

74
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,640
But I have started, occasionally,

75
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,960
waking up in the middle of the night
needing a pee...

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,880
[laughter]

77
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,280
...which is a very depressing development.

78
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,960
There's an elder gentleman
who applauded that.

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,920
-What a... What a funny moment.
-[laughter]

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,920
"I'm there with you, my friend."

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
[laughter]

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,760
[Michael laughs]

83
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,360
My bladder used to be fine.

84
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,160
Like many young bladders in this room,
I'd go to sleep at night.

85
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,600
I'd be like, "Night, blad."

86
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
My bladder would be like,
"Night, Mikey. Sleep well."

87
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,000
"I will."

88
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
[laughter]

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,120
I'd wake up in the morning,
my bladder's like, "Look,

90
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
we are full down here,

91
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,120
but no cause for alarm.

92
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,320
Next time you're passing the loo,
I will need emptying.

93
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,920
But chill out, relax, no rush on this.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,240
Have some breakfast, have some juices.

95
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,200
Have some smoothies.
Tea, coffee, whatever you want.

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,680
Cereal, more milk, don't mind if you do.
I've got this...

97
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,920
till at least noon."

98
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
Well, not anymore.

99
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,840
Now, when I'm deep asleep
in the middle of the night,

100
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,880
my bladder sends messages to my brain

101
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,840
to give me dreams that I'm pissing myself.

102
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,279
-[laughter]
-This is how it wakes me up.

103
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,839
[applause]

104
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,320
I'm having a normal anxiety dream.

105
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm back at school. [laughs]

106
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,840
I'm in an exam I haven't revised for.

107
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,280
I'm just having a weird dream,
and then I look down...

108
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,760
Oh, and I've peed my pants as well.
I wake up in a panic!

109
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,200
Have I pissed my pants?

110
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,280
I look down, my bladder's like, "Nearly!

111
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,000
We've got to go now! Up!

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
-Now!"
-[laughter]

113
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,440
And you lie there,
"But I don't want to get up.

114
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,320
It's three o'clock in the morning,
I don't want to."

115
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,680
And you fight it,
but your bladder's insistent.

116
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,000
"I'm afraid you have to wake up,
it's a very dangerous situation down here.

117
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,800
I don't think I can handle it."

118
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,000
So that involves getting out of the bed
and going around the bed,

119
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,240
out of the door, into the bathroom,
which is over there, right?

120
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,880
Round the bed because my wife is there,
she's closest to the door.

121
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,360
That's her side.

122
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,160
-[laughter]
-This is my side, that's her side.

123
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,920
It's been that way for 20 years.

124
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It will never, ever change.
We all have our sides.

125
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Have you ever gone on to
your partner's side?

126
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,200
It's the weirdest sensation!

127
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,080
-[screams]
-[laughter]

128
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,000
"It's the same room,
but it looks really weird from here!

129
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,800
-[laughter]
-I don't like it!"

130
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,600
[laughter]

131
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,440
So I've got to go round the bed,
and I can't wake her up.

132
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,960
I cannot wake my wife.
If my wife is awoken in the night,

133
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,000
she won't get back to sleep,
she'll blame me, she'll be up.

134
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,520
"Why'd you have to wake me up?
Why do you make so much noise?"

135
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,640
So I have to make sure she stays asleep.
And also, if she wakes up in the night,

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,520
she will inevitably go on her phone,

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,200
which means she will inevitably buy shoes.

138
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,320
-[laughter]
-She buys so many shoes

139
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,600
on her phone on online shopping.

140
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,680
She-- She buys shoes
when she's in the bath, 

141
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,920
she buys shoes at traffic lights,

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,760
she bought a pair of shoes
on the way up a roller coaster.

143
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,400
-She's addicted.
-[laughter]

144
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,760
It's costing a fortune.

145
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,720
Little bit of an insight
into how bad it is.

146
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,640
The other night,
I was lying in bed on my laptop.

147
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,640
She's next to me on her mobile phone.

148
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,240
The children are both in the room as well,
they're both on iPads,

149
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,720
and the television is on in front of us.

150
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,600
It's a wonderful, modern family scene.

151
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,880
[laughter]

152
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,520
It's not like we don't chat as a family.

153
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,080
Sometimes there's a WhatsApp ping
and we discuss whose phone it was.

154
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,120
"Ping!" "Was that you? I think it was me."
"I think your phone just went."

155
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,360
"Thank you, right you are."
And then we get back to our devices.

156
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,280
[laughter]

157
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,240
I was on internet banking at the time.

158
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,960
I could see money

159
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,320
-coming out of the account in real time.
-[laughter]

160
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,320
Every time I refreshed it,
we had less money in the bank!

161
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
[laughter]

162
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,800
"You are doing this right now, darling?"

163
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,920
"But these shoes are so beautiful,
darling! I just had to! I just had to!

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
If it upsets you, stop refreshing."

165
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,560
"Please, leave us something
for the morning!"

166
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,560
[laughter]

167
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,280
So I can't wake her up, can't wake her up.
It's gonna cost a fortune.

168
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,440
So I've got to creep round,
get to the loo.

169
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,720
That is easier said than done,
on account of the floorboards.

170
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,280
I never realized we had creaky floorboards

171
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,520
until I started creeping around on them
in the middle of the night.

172
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,760
I've never noticed the floorboards
make a noise in the daytime.

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,320
As soon as my foot...

174
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,480
steps out of the bed
in the dead of night...

175
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,200
[imitates creaking]

176
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,400
[laughter]

177
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,280
I can see my wife stirring in her sleep.

178
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,680
Her arm is subconsciously reaching
for her mobile.

179
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,040
"No!"

180
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,520
[laughter]

181
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,880
[imitates creaking]
I try and find a non-creaky...

182
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,920
[imitates creaking]

183
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,360
[laughter]

184
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,720
[imitates creaking] "Fuck!"

185
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,680
[laughter]

186
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,120
After a while, I just leg it.

187
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,280
[imitates rapid creaking]

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,760
[laughter]

189
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,800
Everything makes a noise in the night.
Everything.

190
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,920
[cheering and applause]

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't even know...

192
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,640
we had an extractor fan

193
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,280
-until I started peeing in the night.
-[laughter]

194
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,440
I'll go into the loo,
you turn the lights on...

195
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,120
[imitates loud humming sound]

196
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,040
What are we extracting?
I haven't started yet.

197
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,520
-[laughter]
-[imitates loud humming]

198
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,720
It's the loudest thing in the world!
It's gonna wake my wife up!

199
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,800
And there's not two switches.
There's not a switch...

200
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,280
There's not a switch for light

201
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,000
and a switch for...

202
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,560
[loud humming] extraction.

203
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,360
They're on the same circuit.

204
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,160
So if you want the light on,
you have to go... [imitates loud humming]

205
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
which will definitely wake my wife up.

206
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,640
So it means peeing...

207
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,360
in the darkness.

208
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,559
-[laughter]
-Because it's all about sound,

209
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,520
you have to be very sensitive to noise,

210
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,640
'cause you're waiting for the splash.

211
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,039
[laughter]

212
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,080
But you can't pee into the water,

213
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,440
that's too noisy.

214
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,440
-[laughter]
-That will wake my wife up.

215
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,360
So you wait for the water,
and then immediately retreat...

216
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
-[laughter]
-...to find the sweet spot of the bowl

217
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,440
-surrounding the water.
-[applause]

218
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,720
-Yes! This acknowledgment of night peeing!
-[cheering and applause]

219
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,760
Darkness urination.

220
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,440
And sometimes you're peeing and you hear
a different sound, you know, like, "Ooh,

221
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,640
I think that's the floor.
I'm peeing on the floor.

222
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,800
[laughter]

223
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,600
I've overcompensated."

224
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,880
[laughter]

225
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,120
Then you put the light on.

226
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,160
[imitates loud humming sound]

227
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,800
"Yep, I've pissed on the floor."

228
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
-[laughter]
-Then you have to get the loo roll out,

229
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,200
you throw that down.

230
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,080
You create a sort of foot mop situation,

231
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,880
as you remove your own pee
from the bathroom floor.

232
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
"How's your life going, Michael?"
"Well, I'm just foot-mopping piss

233
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,160
-at 3:20 a.m.
-[laughter]

234
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,600
Other than that, really, really happy."

235
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,840
[laughter]

236
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
Then it's back to bed.

237
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,760
[imitates rapid creaking]

238
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,920
[laughter]

239
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,120
Soon as I get into the bedroom,
I can see my wife's face glowing.

240
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,920
[laughter]

241
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,040
The phone.

242
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,960
Like a horror movie.

243
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,280
[laughter]

244
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,120
You can see shoes in her eyeballs.

245
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
[laughter]

246
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,600
"Do you have to make
so much fucking noise, Michael?

247
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,800
[laughter]

248
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,920
I've bought three pairs of shoes there."

249
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,360
-[laughter]
-Damn!

250
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,920
That piss cost me 600 quid!

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,880
-Plus VAT!
-[laughter]

252
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,800
I'm thinking about getting a catheter
just to save money.

253
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,040
[laughter]

254
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,320
[applause]

255
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,240
I've...

256
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,520
-I've actually started...
-[cheering and applause]

257
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,800
And this is good advice for you.

258
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,720
[laughter]

259
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,880
I've started having a Berocca before bed,

260
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,000
then I get glow-in-the-dark pee
and I can see exactly the situation.

261
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,520
[laughter]

262
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,680
But I know where... I'm starting
to actually learn where the creaks are.

263
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,600
I actually... I get out of bed,
and I know where to avoid.

264
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,080
I'm getting quite good at it.

265
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,840
I think as I get older,
I'll get more and more brilliant at it.

266
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,600
By the time I'm 80,
I'll be like <i>Ninja Warrior.</i>

267
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,240
A sort of stealth-pissing pensioner

268
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,880
-in the middle of the night.
-[laughter]

269
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,880
[rapid whooshing]

270
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,960
-[rapid whooshing continues]
-[laughter]

271
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,080
Barely any piss will come out at that age.
[rapid whoosh]

272
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,920
-[rapid whooshing]
-[laughter]

273
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,560
Before realizing I've accidentally peed
in the spare room cupboard,

274
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,560
but this is all to come,
ladies and gentlemen!

275
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
[cheering and applause]

276
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,400
But the good news is,

277
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,400
the only positive to come out

278
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,520
of getting up in the night to pee
[chuckles]

279
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,880
is it does give me the opportunity,
while my wife is asleep,

280
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,120
to readjust the temperature

281
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,920
in the bedroom, because she likes
sleeping in Arctic conditions.

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,760
She sleeps with the window open,

283
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,960
and she calls it "room temperature."

284
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,440
[laughter]

285
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,280
I'm like, "Darling, that's not
room temperature if the window is open. 

286
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,840
That's garden temperature."

287
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,880
[laughter]

288
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,760
We might as well sleep in a tent outside.

289
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,240
-It's freezing!
-[laughter]

290
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,080
"Can we close the window,
put the heating on?"

291
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,040
"No, we can't have the heating on
in the bedroom.

292
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,720
You know we'll get sore throats."

293
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,680
"Well, my throat is quite sore

294
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,520
with the icicles forming in it!"

295
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
[laughter]

296
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,800
But I don't mind,
she can have what she likes, it's fine.

297
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,760
We... We live together.

298
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,960
If she wants it freezing,
I'll put another blanket on.

299
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,080
It'll be fine. My issue with it is

300
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,560
her relationship with temperature
makes no sense at all.

301
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,800
Why does she want the bedroom
so absolutely freezing,

302
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,600
but her bath is the hottest thing

303
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,880
-known to man?
-[laughter]

304
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,840
There's lava,
and then there's my wife's bath.

305
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,120
When she's in the bath,
steam fills the house.

306
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,360
People are driving down our road
with fog lights on going,

307
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,280
"What's happened in that building?"

308
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,520
[laughter]

309
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,800
And often she calls out from the bath,
through the steam,

310
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,920
"Michael, would you like this bath
after me?"

311
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,520
"What, to cook pasta in?

312
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,440
No."

313
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,360
[laughter]

314
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,840
Danger.

315
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,640
[applause]

316
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,920
'Cause we've all done that.

317
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
[chuckling] We've all got into a bath

318
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,640
that's too hot.

319
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,000
And it's normally our own fault,
we don't have time to wait.

320
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,200
When we run the hot tap,
and we run the cold,

321
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,000
we don't have time to wait
for the full, proper temperature

322
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,360
to reveal itself.
You just have a, "Should be fine."

323
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,080
You go away, busy life, and you come back,

324
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
and you normally know
as soon as your foot goes in.

325
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,240
As soon it goes in, you normally go,
"Ooh! I've...

326
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,440
-I've run that a bit too hot."
-[laughter]

327
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,600
But often you don't realize it
until you're in already.

328
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
You get in,
and you start lowering yourself,

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,480
because it takes a while

330
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,040
for the information
that your feet are burning...

331
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,040
[laughter]

332
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,200
...to reach your brain,
where the information has to go

333
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,440
to tell you about it.

334
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,080
Because it's really quite a long way
for the information to travel.

335
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,840
So you start lowering yourself
and thinking,

336
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,840
"Something doesn't feel
altogether right here."

337
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,800
Then it just hits you.

338
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,760
-[screams]
-[laughter]

339
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
You have a split-second decision,

340
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,920
-"Do I stay, or do I go?"
-[laughter]

341
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,640
And many times you just go,
"I can't! Oh, my God, I can't!"

342
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,480
And you end up standing naked
in your bathroom.

343
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,600
You look down, you've got these
sort of red skin socks of pain. "Ow!

344
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,640
Look what I did to myself!"

345
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,000
[laughter]

346
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,240
Then you have to empty the hot out
to put the cold in,

347
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,280
which involves sacrificing your arm

348
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
to plunge to the plug.

349
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,880
Plug plunging, very dangerous.

350
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,800
You look at your arm as if to say,
"This will hurt, I do apologize.

351
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,840
Brace yourself."

352
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,440
-[screams]
-[laughter]

353
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,640
Sometimes you can't get a purchase.
You're like, "I could lose my arm!"

354
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,000
[laughter]

355
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,440
But the braver amongst us,

356
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,960
there's many here tonight,
and I count myself amongst you,

357
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,560
will hover paddle.

358
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
This is where you get into the bath,

359
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,720
even though it hurts,

360
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,280
and you hover over the surface.

361
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,560
You get the cold on,

362
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,320
-and you start paddling like a maniac.
-[laughter]

363
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,280
-"We can change this!
-[applause]

364
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,080
-It's getting better all the time now!
-[cheering and applause]

365
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,040
Be brave! Be brave!"

366
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,320
Then you inherently know,

367
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,840
"It's time to change direction now!
Come on!

368
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,280
It's getting better, it's getting better!
Come on!"

369
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,240
[laughter] 

370
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,520
And then you have to test it.
How is the water going?

371
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,640
Is it ready to fully submerge?

372
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,760
And you do this with your bottom,
you select your bottom,

373
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,560
and the task of your bottom
is simply to dip in

374
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,560
to see, is it ready? How's it going?
Is-- How's it going?

375
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,240
This is where I forget,
unfortunately, that I have balls.

376
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
[laughter] 

377
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,600
It's not so much that I forget.

378
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,040
It's more the angle of dangle...

379
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,960
[laughter]

380
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,240
...means that my balls
are now the closest thing

381
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,840
to the surface of the water,
not my bottom after all.

382
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,760
[laughter]

383
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,840
And it comes as a nasty surprise.

384
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,840
[screams]

385
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,760
[laughter]

386
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,160
It's the most sensitive part
of the human body

387
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,800
It's the last part of the human body,
let's be honest,

388
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,720
that you would volunteer...

389
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,360
-[laughter]
-...to test

390
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,400
boiling water with.

391
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,920
[laughter]

392
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,200
No one's ever handed me a cup of tea
and said, "Michael...

393
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,400
[blowing]

394
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,240
This might be a little bit
on the hot side." [blows]

395
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,200
"Well, we shall soon find out, my friend."

396
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,680
[laughter]

397
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,280
[applause]

398
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,240
[cheering and applause]

399
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,280
[Michael laughing]

400
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,880
[screams]

401
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,040
"Right you are,

402
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
little bit more milk.

403
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,040
-[laughter]
-Just a splash.

404
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,000
Just tested it
with my hover-paddle hardened bollocks

405
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,040
there, my friend."

406
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,720
-[laughter]
-[Michael laughs]

407
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,480
Thirsty work.

408
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,480
Thirsty work here.

409
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,720
This is, uh, bottled water.

410
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,720
They've taken the label off it
because of advertising.

411
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,240
Because they're worried
that people watching Netflix

412
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,560
might want to, uh, look like me.

413
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,320
[laughter]

414
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,560
Can you imagine? "What does he drink?"

415
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
[chuckles]

416
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,520
It's, uh, Evian, of course. Uh...

417
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,800
-[laughter]
-[chuckles]

418
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,960
If you were wondering.

419
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,960
[in French accent]
Evian. "Live young, Evian."

420
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,240
[laughter]

421
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
Middle class people love bottled water,
don't they?

422
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,480
It's a colorless, odorless,
tasteless liquid

423
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,599
and it tastes the same
no matter what brand you get.

424
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,280
It's a miracle of branding and marketing
that people prefer different ones.

425
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,560
"Oh, I like Voss." "I like Fiji."
"I like Buxton."

426
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,280
"I'm a Highland Spring guy."

427
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,200
-[laughter]
-It's the same... same water.

428
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,800
And they get very offended,
you must have seen this in restaurants

429
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,400
when the waiter comes over,
"Can I get you a drink?"

430
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,680
"Uh, yes, can we just have water, please?
Still water, we're fine with still water."

431
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,040
Sometimes the waiter goes, "Tap?"

432
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,600
-[laughter]
-It's a horrible moment.

433
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,240
-[laughter]
-It's like he's just said, "Puddle?

434
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,320
[laughter]

435
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,360
I could scoop some from the pavement?
It rained earlier."

436
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,760
[laughter]

437
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,320
And people are so offended.

438
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,960
"Uh, excuse me, how dare you?

439
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,760
Are you trying to poison
me and my children?

440
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,760
Do you not have any respect?
Do you think I can't afford bottled water?

441
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,680
We'll have Evian, please, or something.

442
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,920
There's a mountain on the bottle,
we find it reassuring.

443
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,760
We don't want your disgusting tap water.

444
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,000
We don't know the condition of your taps
and your tanks and your pipes.

445
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,840
How revolting. Your rat-infested tanks?

446
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,160
Water that's been drained and flushed
for centuries?

447
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,960
You're trying to give that to me?
How revolting.

448
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,600
-[laughter]
-"Ice?"

449
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,520
"Yes, could you freeze the shit water
and put it into the bottled water?

450
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,560
Because we haven't thought this through
at all.

451
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,480
-[cheering and applause]
-We'd like a slow death,

452
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,160
a slow release of poisoned rat water
into the purity of Evian."

453
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,640
[laughter]

454
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,840
So this is a culmination

455
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,240
of, um, a tour I've been doing
for a while,

456
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,880
on and off, all around the world.

457
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,520
It's a big world tour, a big world tour.

458
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,840
[cheering]

459
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,960
And I suppose it's amazingly exciting
to be home at the end of it

460
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,680
because I've been far flung,
far flung places.

461
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,200
Probably the furthest I've been
is the furthest anybody's been from here,

462
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,480
which is New Zealand, New Zealand.

463
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,800
-New Zealand is, um... [chuckles]
-[cheering]

464
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,760
Yeah, New Zealand's amazing,
I love New Zealand.

465
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,040
Um, but it takes 24 hours,
as you know, to get there from here

466
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,600
and that's a day of your life gone,
just gone, it's insane.

467
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,240
And the jetlag is monumental.

468
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,560
So I landed in Auckland, New Zealand.

469
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,280
I thought, I've got to get
onto the time zone as quickly as possible.

470
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,480
So I pulled out the bezel of my watch,

471
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,120
and I said to the stewardess,
"What's the time difference here?

472
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
I just want to get onto the new time zone.
What's the time difference here?"

473
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,920
[New Zealand accent] "It's 12 hours ahead.

474
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,080
The time difference in New Zealand,
it's 12 hours ahead.

475
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,880
We're 12 hours ahead in New Zealand."

476
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,440
So I started to wind my watch 12 hours.

477
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,480
[laughter]

478
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,480
And I notice in my peripheral vision
she was looking at me like I was an idiot.

479
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,640
I thought, "What's her problem?
She needs to jog on."

480
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,480
I got to about eight hours in
and I realized,

481
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,120
"Oh, right, I'm going to land

482
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,600
in exactly the same place that I started."

483
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,880
[laughter]

484
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,040
[applause]

485
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,280
So... So, rather than look a fool,
I wound it back.

486
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,440
"Thank you, I'll be fine from here.

487
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,800
Thank you for your help."

488
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,720
They talk like that in New Zealand.

489
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,080
[New Zealand accent] On the front
of their mouths like this.

490
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,120
It's quite fast, it's quite pacey.

491
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,760
And basically, they change the vowels,

492
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,720
they have a strange relationship
with vowels.

493
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,560
They get to a vowel
and they just pick another

494
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,800
and go with that one instead.
It's a thing. 

495
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
'Cause Australia's a little bit different,
it's much slower in Australia.

496
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,840
[Australian accent] They take their time.
They love the vowels.

497
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,520
When they see a vowel, they're just like,
"We're gonna stay

498
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,160
[drawn out] there.

499
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,640
-[laughter]
-I see no reason...

500
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,840
to rush this sentence, mate.

501
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,600
We're gonna stay on the vowel."

502
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,760
[New Zealand accent] But New Zealand,
it's all about changing the vowel.

503
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,040
[normal voice] I had a bit of an incident

504
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,160
on account
of this vowel changing situation,

505
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,880
and I'm going to be honest and upfront.
It was quite rude.

506
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,960
-Um, but it's funny. [chuckles]
-[laughter]

507
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,840
When I was checking into the hotel
in Auckland, um,

508
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,080
she wanted to tell me, the receptionist,
about this new swimming pool

509
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,760
that they'd built on the sixth floor. Six.

510
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,920
The six floor. Um...

511
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,320
And surrounding the pool was a deck.

512
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
-Uh, with an "E."
-[laughter]

513
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,800
And it was known as "The Deck,"

514
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,760
and in the lift it went, "The Deck."

515
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,360
[chuckles] I was checking in, she said,

516
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,280
[New Zealand accent]
"While you're staying here,

517
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,560
are you gonna spend some time
sitting on the Deck?"

518
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,360
[laughter]

519
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,680
[normal voice] "That is an astonishing
assumption to make of me."

520
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,440
She said, [New Zealand accent] "There's
a lovely big deck on the sixth floor."

521
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,600
[normal voice] "There's a lovely big dick
on the sex floor?

522
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,640
What kind of a place is this?"

523
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,720
[New Zealand accent] She said,
"The deck is for hanging out."

524
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,440
-[normal voice] "No, it isn't!"
-[laughter]

525
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,560
[New Zealand accent] "Careful, it can get
a bit slippery up there, it's hardwood."

526
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,400
[normal voice] "Oh, please, behave!"

527
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,560
[laughter]

528
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,800
And I went to Australia while I was there.
Obviously nipped over to Australia.

529
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,320
It's beautiful. I love Australia,
I love Australians.

530
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,720
-[cheering]
-Really nice people.

531
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,160
We've got us some Australians over here.
Welcome, I love 'em.

532
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,320
I love 'em. Really...

533
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,600
Really full on, really happy.

534
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,760
They love that you come over,
they're just so grateful.

535
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,200
"Fucking hell, you came all the way!"
Just brilliant.

536
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,320
And it's like a holiday destination,
it's beautiful.

537
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,040
The beaches are beautiful,
the landscape's magnificent.

538
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,200
The only problem, with all due respect,
is the, um...

539
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,160
the sharks have decided
that that's where they should be.

540
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,640
And the circle Australia,

541
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,600
waiting for Australians
to get into the water.

542
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,560
And guess what?

543
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,320
Australians keep getting into the water.

544
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,360
[laughter]

545
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,360
I was-- I went to the beach
with some Australians.

546
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,680
They're like, "You gonna come for a swim,
Mickey? Come and relax, cool off?

547
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,680
Come for a swim,
it's lovely in the water today."

548
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
"No, I don't think so.
I'll be-- I'll be fine."

549
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
"Why not?

550
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,760
Why not?"

551
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,000
"Because there are sharks in there."
"Yeah.

552
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Not always."

553
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,680
-[laughter]
-"I think...

554
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,560
the fact that there's ever been one
is enough for me."

555
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,920
"Ah, come on, Mickey.
You've gotta live your life."

556
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,320
"Yes, until it ends.

557
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,640
Maybe today, with a shark attack,
you see?"

558
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,720
He said, "You've got more chance
of being hit by a car."

559
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,960
"Not when I'm fucking swimming, I don't.
I'll be staying here on the beach."

560
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,600
[laughter and applause]

561
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,520
[cheering]

562
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,760
"I'll be right here.

563
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,800
I'll cool off another way."

564
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,600
So while I was in Australia,
I did see, unfortunately, a gentleman...

565
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,480
This isn't... This isn't funny.
But he was fine. He was fine.

566
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,920
He was...
There was a shark attack incident,

567
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:27,840
but he was fine.

568
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,440
He'd just got bitten on the arm.
It wasn't great.

569
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,720
Um... [chuckles]

570
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,640
I shouldn't laugh.

571
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,120
-[laughter]
-The point I'm trying to make

572
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,280
is that I passionately believe

573
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,960
that this shark attack
would not have happened

574
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,600
if he hadn't have got into the water.

575
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,200
[laughter]

576
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,280
He's lying in his hospital bed

577
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,120
being interviewed on the news.
There's a reporter on the end of his bed.

578
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,680
He's got his arm up in a thing,
he's got his neck in a brace.

579
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,880
She's like,
"So, just if you can, if it's all right,

580
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,520
could you just talk us through,
talk us through, sir, what...

581
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,440
what happened?

582
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,560
He's like, "Yeah, well, I was...
I was just... I-I was just...

583
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,320
[inhales] I was just surfing in the ocean,

584
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,800
and then this shark literally...

585
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,800
came out of nowhere."

586
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,800
[laughter]

587
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,240
Not exactly.

588
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,120
-The shark was in its natural habitat.
-[laughter]

589
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,000
You're the one who literally
came out of nowhere

590
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,000
and offered yourself as a light snack.

591
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,560
-[laughter]
-On a plate.

592
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,440
Literally, on a long, thin platter.

593
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,080
[cheering and applause]

594
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,840
Get out of the water.

595
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,920
It's not like he's being interviewed
in his hospital bed

596
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,040
and he's like, "I was...

597
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,320
I was on the fourth floor
of my Melbourne apartment...

598
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
-[laughter]
-...unloading the dishwasher.

599
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,240
I pulled out the top rack
to put my mug in,

600
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,360
and this shark
literally came out of nowhere,

601
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,280
-attacked me on the arm."
-[laughter]

602
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,280
"I was an internal flight to Adelaide.

603
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:03,880
I looked out the plane,
there's a fucking shark on the wing."

604
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,480
[laughter]

605
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,560
I will attempt an accent,
you've probably noticed I'll give it a go.

606
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,280
Um, I like accents. It doesn't matter
where you go in the world,

607
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,560
they've developed
their own little way of talking.

608
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,040
[chuckles] I don't know how it starts.

609
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,240
Nobody knows how it evolves.

610
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,960
Beautiful ones, you've got Italy.

611
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,680
[Italian accent] It's so beautiful
in Italy. They speak so beautiful.

612
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,360
I don't know how it evolved,
but it is certainly the most sexy way

613
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,880
of communication

614
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,320
is to talk with an Italian accent,
it's so sexy.

615
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
Everybody love the way I talking.

616
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
-Yeah? You go to France...
-[laughter]

617
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,400
[French accent] A little pissed off,
but still pretty cool, we talk like this.

618
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,800
[normal voice]
Of all the accents in the world,

619
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,240
the one I think
maybe they should ch-change,

620
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,400
and I don't want to disrespect
anybody here who may be from there,

621
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760
but for me,
it's the Northern Irish accent.

622
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,120
What on earth is going on there?

623
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,040
It's not an easy one to do.

624
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,440
[Northern Irish accent]
They've decided, in Northern Ireland,

625
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,080
that the best... the best...
the best way to communicate

626
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,480
is right... right at the back
of their throat, like that.

627
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,560
Just making noises.
Nothing there. Absolutely nothing.

628
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,600
[normal voice]
You don't know what they're saying.

629
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,600
[Northern Irish accent] "We're gonna
make noises in a Northern Irish accent,

630
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,840
just gonna... [mumbles]
What are you even doing here?"

631
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,560
"I don't even know
what you're doing here myself."

632
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,600
[laughter]

633
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,240
[normal voice] How does it start?
Because babies are like...

634
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,160
"Wah!"

635
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,680
[Northern Irish accent]
"No, it's 'Aah!' All right?

636
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,960
If you're going to stay here,
you've got to do the 'Aah.'"

637
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,120
It's right in the back like that,
fucking right at the back. [mumbles]

638
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,360
[laughter]

639
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
[normal voice] The Northern Irish accent
is the only time I've ever heard

640
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,760
somebody sneeze,

641
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,560
[laughing] and I could tell
where they were from…

642
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,680
-[laughter]
-...from the sneeze.

643
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,760
I was in Dubai airport and this bloke
sitting next to me just went...

644
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,240
[gasping and sniffling]

645
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:54,520
[gasping and exhaling]

646
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
"Achoo."

647
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,720
Oh, for goodness sake.

648
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,560
-[laughing and applause]
-[Michael chuckles]

649
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,400
"Are you from, uh, Northern Ireland?"

650
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,640
[Northern Irish accent]
"I am, I'm from Belfast."

651
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,040
[normal voice] "Thought as much."

652
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,240
It's fun though there.
It's nice, nice place.

653
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,240
Did some good shows in Belfast.
Really good audience, up for it.

654
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,360
Nice people, friendly, welcoming.

655
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
Had some time to kill while I was there,

656
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,760
so I went to what was, what is,

657
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,280
the most successful tourism destination
they've ever had

658
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,920
in the whole of Northern Ireland.

659
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,360
It's called the Titanic Quarter.

660
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,080
And it's all about
the building of the <i>Titanic,</i>

661
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,600
that was built in Belfast,

662
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,160
and it's something they're incredibly...

663
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,120
proud of.

664
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,920
[laughter]

665
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,520
It's like they don't know
what happened to the <i>Titanic.</i>

666
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
Where they built it.

667
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,400
I went round this museum,
and I said to somebody working there,

668
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,880
"I'm so sorry, but you do know
what happened to the <i>Titanic?"</i>

669
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,400
[Northern Irish accent]
"It was fine when it left here."

670
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,520
[normal voice]
I don't know if that's the point, mate.

671
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,040
[laughter and applause]

672
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,120
So while I was there,
I had these gigs in America coming up.

673
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,120
Americans are, um...

674
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,760
They're an amazing audience,
I've got to tell you. They're amazing.

675
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,920
As an audience, they're so...
You can see them, just...

676
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
-Ready, up for a good... yes!
-[laughter]

677
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,200
Yes!

678
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,120
They're wild. Wild.

679
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,120
Because, with respect to British people,
and I want you to know, I am one,

680
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,840
so I'm the same as you.

681
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,440
When I went to America, they were...

682
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,720
I did the show in America, they were wild,

683
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,160
whooping, cheering,
laughing and everything.

684
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,840
I went on social media after the show.
Everything was in capitals.

685
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,760
[American accent]
"Michael McIntyre was awesome!

686
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,120
He blew the roof off.

687
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,320
-[excitedly] He was incredible!"
-[laughter]

688
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,840
[normal voice] I don't get that here.

689
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
-I'm going to be honest with you.
-[laughter]

690
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,800
The best I get from British people is,
"He didn't disappoint."

691
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,440
[laughter]

692
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,440
[applause]

693
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,680
Even when we're happy...

694
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,120
-[cheering]
-...we have to reference

695
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,920
our disappointing lives.

696
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
The other one I get here is,
"Surprisingly good."

697
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,120
Why are you so surprised?

698
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,000
-You booked the tickets!
-[laughter]

699
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,320
British people go out
with no expectations.

700
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,280
"I'm not planning on much entertainment

701
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
-this evening."
-[laughter]

702
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,040
"Surprisingly good, wasn't it, Pam?"

703
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,200
So, of all the places I went
on my tour round the world,

704
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,960
I think my funnest one,
the most unexpectedly fun one,

705
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,080
for me has to be, um,
when I did these shows in Asia.

706
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,920
I had never gigged in Asia.

707
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I did Hong Kong and Singapore
back to back.

708
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,960
And I've never even actually
been to Asia before.

709
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,360
And this might come as a surprise
to many of you

710
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,000
to find out that I'm not...

711
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,720
[laughter]

712
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,920
...an Asian person.

713
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,840
I realize... [laughs]

714
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,840
I look Asian.

715
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Especially when I smile,
I get more and more Asian.

716
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,880
Now...

717
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,760
[laughing]

718
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,120
I've looked into this.

719
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,560
My parents, not Asian.

720
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,400
Everybody in my ancestry,
also not from Asia.

721
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:01,200
My children in no way resemble
Asian people.

722
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,440
-I am the sole Asian representative...
-[laughter]

723
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,200
...of my house and family,

724
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,360
and nobody understands
why that's happened.

725
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,080
Even that I myself
mistook myself for an Asian gentleman

726
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,240
in what was a very, very
depressing moment.

727
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,560
I was coming off an airplane,

728
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,800
and you know when they leave newspapers
there for you to grab on the way off?

729
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,280
And I'm coming off in that funnel bit,
you know the funnel bit?

730
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,000
Long-haul flight, not paying attention,
and I notice, in the corner of my eye,

731
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,840
that I'm on the front page
of the Daily Mail.

732
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,280
And my heart sunk. I thought... [gasps]
"What have I done?

733
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,720
Oh, my God, something's happened,
something must have broken

734
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,320
[gasps] while I was in the sky.
[gasps] Oh, my...

735
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,040
What? Oh, my... What is it? Oh, my God."

736
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,320
It was Kim Jong-un.

737
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,440
[laughter]

738
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,440
[applause]

739
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,040
If there's a more depressing moment

740
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,760
in my life,

741
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
I'm yet to experience it.

742
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,640
The sad truth

743
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,440
is that I could probably
unlock Kim Jong-un's iPhone...

744
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,160
[laughter]

745
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,840
...with my fat Asian face.

746
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,080
[laughter]

747
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,560
Maybe the FBI will send me
into the Pyongyang palace

748
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,680
to steal government secrets
in the dead of night.

749
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,480
[chuckles] [American accent] "How are you
with creeping around bedrooms

750
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,880
while people are trying to sleep?"

751
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,760
[normal voice] "I practice that
nightly, sir. I'm your man.

752
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,840
Just give me a schematic of all the creaks
on the floorboards and we'll be fine."

753
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,480
[laughter]

754
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,960
While I was in, uh, Asia, in Hong Kong,

755
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,640
a very, very exciting development
occurred.

756
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
Um... [smacks lips]

757
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,000
This was very unexpected.

758
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,600
Now, I should tell you that I'm married
to a beautiful woman.

759
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
[inhales] She's out of my league.

760
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,840
Um... [smacks lips]

761
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,080
She's like properly... She's hot.

762
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,640
And I know that she's out of my league
because everybody who meets us,

763
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,880
and meets her,

764
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,960
tells us immediately.

765
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,440
They can't help it.

766
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,040
They just look at us and go...

767
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,480
"Why?"

768
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,440
-[laughter]
-They don't understand.

769
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,000
She is a ten. She's a ten.

770
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,640
No doubt about it, she's a ten.

771
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,920
I am like, well...

772
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,240
maybe with a diet and a...
and a tan, and a...

773
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,040
and a great... a great distance

774
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,040
and a short-sighted affliction...

775
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,400
and a low lighting, maybe a six.

776
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,720
[laughter]

777
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,720
Or a five.

778
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,440
[laughter]

779
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,720
I'm feeling it's a four
from this reaction.

780
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,280
-[laughter]
-I'm fine, I'm fine with it, I don't care.

781
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,520
Because in Hong Kong,

782
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm a fucking nine.

783
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,440
-[laughter]
-I'm a nine.

784
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:42,040
-[cheering and applause]
-This is the look

785
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,480
they go for.

786
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,840
'Cause I've got this sort of,
"Is he Asian, is he not Asian?"

787
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,360
Cool, British,
James Bond-y thing going on.

788
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,760
Soon as I got off the plane,
girls were giggling.

789
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,360
[giggling] "Oh, my God!"

790
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,320
[laughter]

791
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,520
I was like, "What?"
I didn't know what had happened.

792
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,560
No one had ever reacted to me like that.

793
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,720
Girls were coming up to me,

794
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,840
[Asian accent]
"Excuse me, oh, my God, where you from?

795
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,680
You have such an interesting face.

796
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,040
Oh, hello."

797
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,440
-[laughter]
-[normal voice] I knew they fancied me

798
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,600
because they were
lowering their face masks to flirt.

799
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,120
[laughter]

800
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,880
[Asian accent] "Hello, stranger.

801
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,360
How you doin'?"

802
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,160
[normal voice] This girl came over to me,
[Asian accent] "Excuse me...

803
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,640
are you a model?"

804
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,920
-[laughter]
-[normal voice] Am I a model?

805
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,760
No, what are you talking about?"

806
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,640
She said, "You look exactly like
the man from the Paco Rabanne adverts."

807
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,680
There's an advertising campaign
in Hong Kong for Paco Rabanne.

808
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,920
I look exactly like the guy in it.
If anything, I'm better looking.

809
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,720
In Hong Kong, I'm a Paco Rabanne model.

810
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:54,720
In this country, I've been offered
zero advertising work whatsoever.

811
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,960
Unless Jacamo come out
with a new jacket boob range,

812
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,760
I don't think that's gonna be changing...

813
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,400
-[cheering and applause]
-...in the near future.

814
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,360
"Shop at Jacamo,
with their new jacket boob range.

815
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,360
Comes in all sizes of boobs."

816
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,360
[laughter]

817
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,719
[laughter]

818
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,679
Not gonna happen.

819
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,199
Doesn't matter. Hong Kong, gorgeous.

820
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,120
[laughter]

821
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,360
Unfortunately, this did lead
to a quite embarrassing, uh,

822
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,639
[chuckles] situation.

823
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,120
My wife's always trying to look after me.
She wasn't with me.

824
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:28,320
Um, I was touring alone,
but I couldn't sleep,

825
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,040
I kept whining about it, "I'm jetlagged,"

826
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,320
so she booked me in for a massage
in the hotel spa.

827
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,760
She said, "It's world-renowned.

828
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,800
Have a massage, it'll help you sleep."

829
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,719
So I go downstairs to the spa,
you know, lift doors open,

830
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,360
there's candles and low music.

831
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,960
There's a few girls on reception,
they're giggling as I walk over

832
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,960
because I'm gorgeous,
but I'm used to it now.

833
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,600
It's almost annoying. [Asian accent]
"He's coming over! Oh, my God!

834
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,199
He's the guy from Paco Rabanne!
Oh, my God!"

835
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,120
[laughter]

836
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:55,239
[normal voice] This one girl lowered
her face mask and put red lipstick on.

837
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,960
[Asian accent] "I can't believe it's him!"

838
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,000
[laughter]

839
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,240
[normal voice] Then she put the face mask
over her lips.

840
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,640
It was seeping through the mask
by the time I got there.

841
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,040
She looked like the Joker in Batman.
Not a good look!

842
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,280
I said, "I'm here for my massage."

843
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,720
She said, "Okay, what you want to do is
you want to go to the men's locker room,

844
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,360
just down there on the right,

845
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,000
and in there you'll find a locker, um...

846
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,000
There's a robe in there,
and some slippers.

847
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,600
Pop those on, and then go straight on
and your therapist will meet you. Enjoy."

848
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
So I went through,
and sure enough I found a locker.

849
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,720
There was a robe in there, some slippers,
just what I was expecting.

850
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,720
But there was something
I wasn't expecting at all.

851
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,040
A tiny packet of disposable...

852
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,720
massage underwear.

853
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,600
-[laughter]
-No man should be wearing these,

854
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
let me tell you.

855
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,040
There was a string
that went round one hip,

856
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,480
a string that went round the other,

857
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,840
and then barely any fabric at all
in the middle here.

858
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,760
But, as I say, I'd never seen
these disposable massage pants before.

859
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,280
I assumed it was a face mask for my face.

860
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,080
[laughter]

861
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,120
So the side stringy bits
I hooked onto my ears, like this.

862
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,280
[laughter]

863
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,760
And I put my face where my balls
were supposed to be housed.

864
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,520
Put the robe on, and the slippers,

865
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,560
and I start coming down the corridor
with these pants on my face.

866
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,880
[laughter]

867
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,640
I got into the massage room,
the girl was like...

868
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,280
[laughing]

869
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,400
[Asian accent]
The pants are on your face!"

870
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,840
-[laughter]
-[normal voice] I took it off, she's like,

871
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,200
[gasps] [Asian accent]
"It's the man from Paco Rabanne!"

872
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,280
[laughter]

873
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,280
[applause]

874
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,320
[cheering and applause]

875
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,880
[normal voice] Isn't it lovely,
ladies and gentlemen, isn't it nice,

876
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,440
just... just for this... just for this...

877
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,240
while we're doing this show,
to not be on our phones?

878
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,480
But it's nice, isn't it?

879
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,920
Look at all of us. It's such a rarity.

880
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,880
Look at us all. No one...

881
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,160
No one's on their phone.

882
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,280
You probably used your phones
to book your tickets for tonight.

883
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,880
It's very easy.
You go online, you go to the theater.

884
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,040
You can pick your seats.

885
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,280
It's all very easy to do
when you're booking things online.

886
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,040
But there's a weird thing that's going on
when you're booking tickets.

887
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,840
It doesn't always happen, and nobody knows

888
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,720
what the hell it's all about.

889
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,800
You're booking your tickets online,
and it suddenly just goes,

890
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,080
"Are you a robot?"

891
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,600
[laughter]

892
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,760
Extraordinary question.

893
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:29,480
No one's ever suspected
I'm anything other human.

894
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,880
And you tick the box and you go,
"No, I'm not a robot.

895
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,560
This is really weird, can we carry on?"

896
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,200
And they go, "No." The computer goes,
"No, we can't carry on.

897
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,240
We're going to have to run some tests

898
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,240
to confirm that you are human

899
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,440
and not a robot."

900
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,800
And you think, "Well, this should be
the easiest test I've ever taken.

901
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,640
I'm gonna ace this test.

902
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,840
All I have to do is prove my humanity!

903
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,240
I've br-- I've--
I've fathered other humans.

904
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,320
I'm definitely not a robot.
Come on, anything you've got.

905
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,400
This is such a waste of time.

906
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,680
What are the questions?"

907
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,840
"Okay, so, here are some boxes.

908
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,440
Which one is a shopfront?"

909
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,560
-[laughter]
-"Oh.

910
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,920
Why is this so difficult?

911
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,360
[laughter]

912
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,920
Where are these creepy
middle-American shops, anyway?"

913
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,960
[laughter]

914
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,200
Sometimes the shop is bleeding
into more than one box.

915
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,520
What are we supposed to do?
Do we just tick the main box

916
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,880
or all the boxes around it?
What are the rules of this robot quiz? 

917
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,880
-[laughter]
-So you go, "That one, that one,

918
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,040
and I'm just guessing that one."

919
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,120
And you press send. It goes, "No.

920
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,960
-You got that wrong.
-[laughter]

921
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,040
We still suspect you might be a robot.

922
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,760
How are you with bridges?"

923
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,720
"I don't know.
I thought I was good at shops!"

924
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,680
[laughter]

925
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,800
Sometimes I get so many wrong in a row,
I'm like,

926
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,720
"Darling, am I a robot?
You would tell me?"

927
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,000
[laughter]

928
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,400
My kids, I realized the other day,

929
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,080
they don't even know of a time
when there was no internet.

930
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,560
Their whole life, they've had internet.

931
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,040
They can't fathom how--

932
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,520
They ask the question,
"How did you survive?"

933
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,360
-[laughter]
-And I have no answer.

934
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,600
-"I don't really remember.
-[laughter]

935
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,280
I don't really remember."

936
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,920
But we can think back now
to the dawn of the internet.

937
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,440
Remember those first few years,

938
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:19,360
when we always said "www."
before every website?

939
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,080
What a waste of time that was.

940
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,920
Why did it take us three years

941
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,680
to realize
all the websites start with www.?

942
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,000
[laughter]

943
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,240
"You can get us at our website,
www.amazon.com."

944
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,080
"It's www.ebay.com."

945
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,160
"www.tripadvisor.com."

946
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,360
Some of them must be so painful.

947
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,680
The World Wrestling Federation.

948
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,120
"You can catch us on our website,
www.wwwf.com."

949
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,720
-[laughter]
-Every day having to say that shit.

950
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,840
The World Wildlife Fund.

951
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,440
"Of course, don't forget to donate,

952
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,480
at www.wwwf.com."

953
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,400
[laughter]

954
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,280
We must have wasted a fortnight
of our lives just going, "wwwwww..."

955
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,760
[laughter]

956
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,960
And think back, think back now,

957
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,240
now that the internet is so much
a part of our lives,

958
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,400
think back...

959
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,560
think back to our first password,

960
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,560
because our minds, our brains

961
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,560
are so filled with passwords.

962
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,960
It's such a struggle for us
to remember all the passwords.

963
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,720
We go to businesses online

964
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
and you go, "I can't remember.

965
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,560
I can't remember my password."

966
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,600
And you put it in.
Sometimes they lock you out,

967
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,520
and they go, "No, you've got one more try
to remember your own password,

968
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,680
you fucking idiot."

969
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,400
-"Oh, God!"
-[laughter]

970
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,400
Or you click "I forgot it,"

971
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,200
and they ask you questions
about your life,

972
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
and you don't even remember the answers.

973
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,720
-They're about your own life!
-[laughter]

974
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,360
"What is your favorite pet?"
"Oh, no, I can't believe I chose one."

975
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,320
[laughter]

976
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,680
The dog walks in,
"If it isn't me, I'm leaving.

977
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,920
-I'm literally walking out the door."
-[laughter]

978
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,480
"www."

979
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,200
[applause]

980
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh, the passwords.

981
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,920
And at the beginning,
we all had one password.

982
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,320
It was our... It was our first password.

983
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,000
We can nostalgically remember.

984
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:18,200
And we used it for everything,
every time we joined another business.

985
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,640
"Can I have your password?"
"Yes, you can, that is my special word."

986
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,080
-[laughter]
-And then...

987
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,240
companies started getting quite rude.

988
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,040
You would put your password in,
and it would go, "Weak."

989
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,280
-"Who are you to judge my special word?"
-[laughter]

990
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,040
[laughter]

991
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,120
They're like, "Sorry, but the internet
has become very popular,

992
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,680
we need to strengthen your password."

993
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,640
And businesses would insist,

994
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,440
"We must have from you a capital letter.

995
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,040
I'm sorry, we will not be
accepting passwords anymore

996
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,320
unless it contains
at least one capital letter.

997
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,200
And we all momentarily
considered our options

998
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,360
before deciding to capitalize
the first letter of our password.

999
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,880
[laughter]

1000
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,840
And for a period of time, that was fine.

1001
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,880
But the internet became even more popular,

1002
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,720
and then businesses started saying,
"I'm afraid you cannot join

1003
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,880
unless you have
at least one capital letter

1004
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,560
and at least one number."

1005
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:23,440
Again, less than half
a microsecond's consideration

1006
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,640
before we collectively decided,

1007
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,600
-"You shall be getting the number one...
-[laughter]

1008
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,480
...and that will be at the end
of my now capitalized password."

1009
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,600
[applause]

1010
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,560
And, for a period of time,
this was acceptable,

1011
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:43,160
until a whole new unexpected

1012
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,320
and exciting dawn emerged.

1013
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,440
A world of special characters.

1014
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,280
-[laughter]
-We didn't even know what they were!

1015
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,680
And businesses would say,
"We need a capital letter,

1016
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,920
we need a number, but we will also
require a special character.

1017
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,440
And we clicked on the button,
"Please, can I have some examples

1018
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,080
of these special characters
which you now insist upon?"

1019
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,320
And we perused them. "There they are.

1020
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,760
I had no idea these characters
were so special."

1021
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,520
Until all of our eyes

1022
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,120
stopped upon...

1023
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,120
the exclamation mark.

1024
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,880
[laughter and applause]

1025
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,120
"You're coming with me."

1026
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,040
[cheering]

1027
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,880
Which we then put at the end
of our now capitalized password,

1028
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,440
just after the one.

1029
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:37,360
[laughter]

1030
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,120
And it's at this moment

1031
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,960
that everybody at the London Palladium
is thinking,

1032
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,040
"I should probably change my password.
I'm probably gonna do that tomorrow.

1033
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,240
Do that now.

1034
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,760
-[cheering and applause]
-Need to think of another special word.

1035
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,560
Better get that changed."

1036
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,760
[applause continues]

1037
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,040
[Michael laughs]

1038
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,840
But this is it,
this is what's happening, of course,

1039
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,920
in the 20, in the 20s, 2020s,
in the 2020s.

1040
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:07,840
Technology will only improve.
It's supposed to make our lives easier.

1041
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:10,720
Sometimes, in my opinion,
a little bit too easy.

1042
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,680
I just got a new car.

1043
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Everything is automated.
I don't do a thing for myself in this car.

1044
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,320
It gets dark, the headlights come on

1045
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,560
[pew] on their own.

1046
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:21,040
It starts raining, the windscreen wipers
come on on their own.

1047
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,960
But it means that you're physically
doing less in the car,

1048
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,960
and, let's be honest, it all adds up.

1049
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,760
It all adds up if you get lazy
and everything's done for you.

1050
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,680
Like, there are young people here
who use the expression,

1051
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,840
"Can you roll the window up?

1052
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,960
Can you roll the window down?
Mum, roll the window up.

1053
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,280
Roll the window down."

1054
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,600
But their whole lives, they've been
pushing button like this. Pushing button.

1055
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,080
They know nothing...

1056
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,760
of the decades that we spent
physically doing this shit.

1057
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,920
-[laughter]
-Not easy.

1058
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,640
Often it would get stuck.
It was quite... [straining]

1059
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,240
Good for your bicep.

1060
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,680
Don't need to go to the gym,
just roll the window down.

1061
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,840
Sometimes when the window was
all the way down, it would start raining.

1062
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,960
It would be amazing, a super-fast wind-up.

1063
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,840
[laughter]

1064
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,320
The passenger one,
leaning over and doing that.

1065
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,160
You could try them both at the same time
if you were feeling confident.

1066
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,520
Don't go to the gym.

1067
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,760
To move the seat in my new car,
it's all done by buttons.

1068
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:16,160
There's a button next to the seat,
you move it to go forward.

1069
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,560
You move it to go back. Errr.

1070
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,640
The back rest. Err, err, err-err.

1071
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,480
All pushing buttons.

1072
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,480
That's all you're doing with your fingers.

1073
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,360
Back in the day, of course,
there'd be a lever

1074
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,720
between your legs.

1075
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,200
You'd lift it up and it would shoot you...

1076
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,200
[laughter]

1077
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,880
...along rails
into the backseat of the car.

1078
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,080
"Hello! I'm in the back now!"

1079
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:40,360
You could see the rails in front of you
like a mini roller coaster in reverse.

1080
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,040
Then you'd have to shag your way...

1081
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
[laughter]

1082
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,160
...to your favored driving position.

1083
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,600
Very good for your core.

1084
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,240
[applause]

1085
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,240
Often you would over-shag.

1086
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,440
You would over-shag
all the way, whoa, to the steering wheel,

1087
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,000
then have to back-shag...

1088
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,080
-[laughter]
-...with sensitivity.

1089
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,440
Gentlemen of the '70s
were much better lovers.

1090
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,200
They're always shagging up and down
in the Cortina for practice,

1091
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,920
just to find
their favored driving position.

1092
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,040
So I had a bit of a weird moment
in the car the other day with, um...

1093
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,240
[clears throat] with my wife.

1094
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,560
Now, look...

1095
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,120
My relationship...

1096
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,960
and I don't know
if I speak for all men here,

1097
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,120
I feel like it's a never-ending quest

1098
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,600
with my wife to find out
what I'm supposed to be doing.

1099
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,520
I never quite know exactly
what I'm supposed to be doing.

1100
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,600
So we're driving in the car,
and she's in the passenger seat.

1101
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,000
Very odd, this was.

1102
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,320
I go past a parking space,

1103
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,880
I realize I've gone past it,
and I go, "Oh, I need to reverse."

1104
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,640
So I do a classic move,
we've all seen this,

1105
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,080
I put my arm around her,
sort of, you know, lean up like that.

1106
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:46,160
You know, just sort of...

1107
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,080
You know. And then reverse, quite fast.

1108
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,000
[imitates sound of car reversing]

1109
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,760
And then wind it into a space, nice.

1110
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,480
Felt pretty good, decent maneuver.

1111
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,320
Didn't think much of it,
didn't make a thing.

1112
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,760
My wife looks at me and she goes, "Ooh.

1113
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,160
"I find that really sexy."

1114
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,080
[laughter]

1115
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,880
I had no idea what she was talking about.

1116
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,480
I'm looking outside the car,
"What? What happened? Did something--

1117
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,640
What are you talking about?"

1118
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,200
She said, "I've always found that
really sexy, when men do that."

1119
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,600
"What men? What men are you talking about?

1120
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,520
Who are these sexy men?
What are you talking about?"

1121
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,120
She said,
"Just when you reverse like that,

1122
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,040
I've always found that really sexy
and you don't normally do that."

1123
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,240
"Do what? What are you...
What are you talking about?"

1124
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:29,400
"Just when you put your arm around me
and then reverse really fast.

1125
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,200
Ooh, I've always found that really sexy."

1126
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,120
[laughter]

1127
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,520
I'm sorry,
but I've been focusing mainly...

1128
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,440
in the bedroom

1129
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,760
for the last 20 years of our relationship

1130
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,520
to arouse you.

1131
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,960
It would have taken me a billion years

1132
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,960
before I attempted maneuvers in the car...

1133
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,960
-[laughter]
-...as part of foreplay.

1134
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,280
"What's the plan for date night?

1135
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,680
Shall we just drive around in reverse
and you tell me when you're up for it?"

1136
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,480
I'm happy to do that now,
seeing as we're here.

1137
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,480
She said, "Michael,
I can't help what I find sexy."

1138
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,000
I said, "Well, is there anything else
really weird

1139
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:10,320
that you find sexy
that I should know about?"

1140
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,560
She said, "Let me have a think."
I said, "Please do."

1141
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,360
She said, "Oh, there is one thing
that men do."

1142
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,920
"Sorry, who are the men
which you speak of?"

1143
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,200
[laughter]

1144
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,920
"It's just that you don't do it, Michael."
"Do what?"

1145
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,640
She said, "You know when men
take their sweater off,

1146
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,960
take their jumper off,
and just reach behind their back,

1147
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:29,800
and then... [whoosh]

1148
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:32,400
just take it off in one go." She said,

1149
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:34,400
"Oh. Ohh."

1150
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,840
She starts moaning.

1151
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,680
-"Ohh.
-[laughter]

1152
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,560
I find that <i>really </i>sexy."

1153
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,600
[laughter]

1154
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,560
-"I'm sorry, what are you talking about?"
-[laughter]

1155
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,320
"They just reach behind their back,
and then [whoosh]

1156
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,000
just take their jumper off."

1157
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,720
-"You don't find my way sexy?
-[laughter]

1158
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,720
When I get the sleeves and I...

1159
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,880
[laughter]

1160
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,800
...slowly and expertly work my way up...

1161
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,880
[laughter]

1162
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,640
[cheering and applause]

1163
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,480
And then you have to pull it off."

1164
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,680
[whistling and applause]

1165
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,200
She said, "As a matter of fact,
I do not...

1166
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,360
-[laughter]
-[laughing] find that sexy."

1167
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,760
So I thought, "Fine,
I'm gonna put this to the test."

1168
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,360
Banked it, yeah?

1169
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,400
Few weeks later, date night.

1170
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,280
Went out, good night,
few drinks, nice meal.

1171
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,320
Came home, kids are asleep,
happened to be in a sweater.

1172
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,840
Thought, "I'm gonna bloody go for it."

1173
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,680
I didn't realize it would be difficult.

1174
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,640
I didn't realize
I had to practice this move.

1175
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,640
Nor did I realize
it was one of the tighter necklines

1176
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,200
in my wardrobe.

1177
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,640
So I just reached behind my back
and I just went for it, I pulled

1178
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,800
as hard as I could,

1179
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,640
-and my head got stuck in the ring.
-[laughter]

1180
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:00,080
It was like I was being born very slowly.

1181
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,080
-[laughter]
-A definite forceps delivery.

1182
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,720
Also, and I was w--
I was upset about this,

1183
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:08,800
my shirt came up with the jumper,

1184
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,440
so my tummy was just wobbling around
in the open.

1185
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,440
And this was after dinner.
[imitates wobbling]

1186
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,360
"Don't fill up on bread, Michael."
"But it's hot, it's warm."

1187
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,760
[imitates wobbling]

1188
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,400
"Are you gonna finish those potatoes?
They're so yummy, shame to go to waste."

1189
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,120
[imitates wobbling]

1190
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,000
"Shall we share a dessert?"
"Fuck that, I'll have my own."

1191
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,000
-[imitates wobbling]
-[laughter]

1192
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,920
"Petit fours? Don't mind if I do!"

1193
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:34,480
-[imitates wobbling]
-[laughter]

1194
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,920
And I was pulling it so hard

1195
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,240
to keep it sexy.

1196
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,760
It took a while,
and I finally popped out the top.

1197
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,600
[laughter]

1198
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,960
She wasn't there, she'd fucked off.

1199
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,320
[laughter]

1200
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,600
[applause]

1201
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,640
"Babe?

1202
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,360
I did the sexy jumper thing.

1203
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,400
You missed it!

1204
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,920
I thought we could
drive around in reverse for a bit

1205
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,800
-and then maybe go to bed?"
-[laughter]

1206
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,400
So here,

1207
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,840
-ladies and gentlemen...
-[laughter]

1208
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,280
...is a bit of an overshare.

1209
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,080
Hashtag...

1210
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,080
"Too much information."

1211
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,600
[laughter]

1212
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,600
I said to her after all this stuff,
I said, "Babe... Babe... Babe...

1213
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,360
I'm tired of this trial and error
approach.

1214
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,880
Why don't-- We should just communicate.

1215
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,280
Why don't you just tell me,
after all these...

1216
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,520
Let's just talk about it, just tell me,

1217
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,160
what really turns you on.

1218
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,800
She went, "What, really?"

1219
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,080
I was like, "Ooh."

1220
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,160
"Whatever that is, I wanna know!"

1221
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,560
[laughter]

1222
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,600
"What really turns you on?"

1223
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,840
She went, "For real?" "Yes."

1224
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,320
"You really wanna know?" "Yes.

1225
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,520
"Seriously?" "Yes, just tell me."

1226
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,320
"For real?" "Yes." She went...

1227
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,720
"Black men."

1228
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,000
[laughter]

1229
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,680
[laughter and applause]

1230
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,280
-[applause continues]
-[whistling]

1231
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:12,520
"How exactly am I supposed to work that
into our anniversary, darling?"

1232
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,080
[laughter]

1233
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:18,120
Despite this, things are going well.

1234
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:19,400
Um... [chuckles]

1235
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,960
Still together. [chuckles]
Kids are growing up.

1236
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,240
Um... [smacks lips]

1237
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,960
Ozzy, my youngest, he's, uh...
he's still a kid, really.

1238
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,320
I mean, my...
Lucas is 14 now, Ozzy's like 11.

1239
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,840
So he's still a little boy.

1240
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:32,920
And he's...
he's a very bright, amazing boy.

1241
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,120
He needs to get off,
he needs to get of the Xbox.

1242
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,760
He has to get off the Xbox.

1243
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,960
Completely bloody addicted
to playing his bloody Xbox.

1244
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,040
And I come in there all the time,
"Come on, off.

1245
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,760
I said five minutes, it's been 45 minutes.

1246
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,680
You were lucky
to get away with that. Off."

1247
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,880
He's like, "I'm coming in a minute, Dad.
I'll be there in a..." [chuckles] Sorry.

1248
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,880
That's not his voice,
I don't know who that was!

1249
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,360
[laughter]

1250
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,840
He is far more middle class than that,
let me tell you!

1251
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,240
[laughs]

1252
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,080
"I'll be there momentarily, Papa.

1253
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:02,360
Just give me a few more minutes
and I'll... I'll be wrapping up shortly.

1254
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,720
-[applause]
-Post-haste."

1255
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,560
I don't know who that first kid was!

1256
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,160
"'Ello, mate, I'm your son.
Does that come as a surprise?"

1257
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,400
[laughter]

1258
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,720
"I've been meaning to ask you, Dad,
[chuckles]

1259
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,440
-how come I'm from the East End...
-[laughter]

1260
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,960
...and you're Chinese?

1261
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,920
I can't get my head around this.

1262
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,200
-What kind of a family am I living in?
-[cheering and applause]

1263
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:25,640
What kind of a family?

1264
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:28,960
And I've just seen Mom
reversing down the road

1265
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,520
with a black geezer. What's happening?

1266
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,520
[laughter]

1267
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,160
[applause]

1268
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,960
I saw a sweater flung out the window.
She looked happy.

1269
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,360
Happier than in a while, I gotta tell.
Big grin on her face."

1270
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,680
[laughter]

1271
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,280
Don't know who that is, sorry.

1272
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,640
So he's always, "I'll get off
in a minute." Always "in a minute."

1273
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,840
I don't think he knows what "in a minute"
means. It's one word, "inaminute".

1274
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,840
"You'll come off now, all right?
Dinner's on the table."

1275
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,760
"I'm coming, I can't...
In a minute, it's a really important game.

1276
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,880
He plays this shooting game,
this Fortnite rubbish.

1277
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,840
"It's a really important game, all right?"

1278
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,600
"Pause it, then."
"I can't pause it, Dad. It won't pause.

1279
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,200
You can't pause it. I can't..."

1280
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,760
"You <i>can </i>pause it!

1281
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,840
I'm putting my foot down!
You need to pause it."

1282
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,080
"I can't pause it.
I'd-- I'd have to kill myself."

1283
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,600
-[laughter]
-"Darling, it's not that serious."

1284
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,160
-[laughter]
-"No, I mean on the game.

1285
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,680
I'd have to kill myself on the game."

1286
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,000
"Then kill yourself, I don't care!"

1287
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,320
[laughter]

1288
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,400
This is what happens now every night
in my house. I call up the stairs, "Ozzy!

1289
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,560
Kill yourself, it's dinner!

1290
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:26,480
[laughter]

1291
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,160
Get your friend to shoot you!
It's Bolognese, getting cold."

1292
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:35,200
Truth is, he doesn't respect me.

1293
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,840
I have no control over him whatsoever.
He runs rings around me.

1294
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,000
He only listens to his mother.
He laughs in my face.

1295
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,600
Every time I raise my voice...
The other day I was like, "Come on,

1296
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,720
it's bedtime now.
Have you brushed your teeth?"

1297
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:47,880
He was like, "Dad, Dad,
there's no need to shout.

1298
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,240
I'm standing right here. I can hear you.

1299
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,560
Calm down."

1300
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,000
He said to me, "Are you tired
or something? Are you tired?"

1301
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:57,120
[laughter]

1302
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,640
"I suppose a little bit,
I am a little bit tired."

1303
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,640
-[laughter]
-The other day he said to me,

1304
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,640
"Is your blood sugar level low?

1305
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,600
-Do you need a snack?"
-[laughter]

1306
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,600
"Yeah, I suppose.
I mean, I am a bit hungry."

1307
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:08,520
[laughter]

1308
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,120
He sent me to my room to lie down.
[mumbling]

1309
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,520
[laughter]

1310
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,720
The big news in our house is, uh...

1311
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,560
Well, we've got... we've got a dog.

1312
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,880
We've never had a dog before.

1313
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,160
There's dog fans!

1314
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,160
-[chuckles] Got a little fluffy...
-[cheering]

1315
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,920
Got a little fluffy dog.

1316
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,080
Little fluffy, lovely little fluffy dog.

1317
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,440
Mr. McFluffintyre.

1318
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:31,800
-He's a very nice...
-[laughter]

1319
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:33,680
[laughing] fluffy,

1320
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,120
fluffy dog. He's very loving.

1321
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,960
You know why he's loving?
Because that's his nature.

1322
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,320
Different breeds of dogs
have different natures. I went to--

1323
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,440
It was like buying a car.
I went on this website, www. something...

1324
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,400
-[laughter]
-[laughs]

1325
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,560
www.whatkindofdog.com.

1326
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Uh...

1327
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,560
It tells you about the different breeds,
all the characteristics,

1328
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,360
and how much you need to walk them,
and how much exercise they need,

1329
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,840
how much you feed them,
whether they molt and all this stuff.

1330
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,560
And there was a category for love,
how loving are they?

1331
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,120
How much do they love people?

1332
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,160
And it was all rated out of five stars,

1333
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:05,640
and I was only considering dogs
that got five stars for love.

1334
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,200
Why would you bring an animal
into your home

1335
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,120
-if it doesn't love you the fullest?
-[laughter]

1336
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,000
And five-star love dogs,
there's, you know, golden retrievers,

1337
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,160
Labradors, and my dog,
the little fluffy Norfolk terrier.

1338
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,480
He's a five-star love dog.

1339
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:21,440
And you can see it in his eyes
when he looks at me, it's unbelievable.

1340
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:24,840
He's like, "I love you so much."

1341
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,080
-[laughter]
-I'm gonna give him a Norfolk accent.

1342
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,440
He's a Norfolk terrier.

1343
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,240
I don't know how he speaks,

1344
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,200
but I assume if he did, he would.

1345
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,720
[Norfolk accent] "I love you so much.
Thank you so much for being my master.

1346
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,360
Thank you so much
for letting me live in your house.

1347
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:41,680
I love what you've done with the place,
it's magnificent. Absolutely beautiful.

1348
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,560
You could be an interior designer
if you put your mind to it.

1349
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,840
I think you could do anything
if you put your mind to it.

1350
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,800
When I look at you, I feel the same way
as an Asian woman does

1351
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,760
when she looks at you.

1352
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,640
I'm absolutely obsessed with you.
I think you're amazing.

1353
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:57,160
I love the way, when you reach up high,
your jacket squeezes up like boobs.

1354
00:56:57,240 --> 00:57:00,560
I love it when I hear you getting up
in the night and I listen for you peeing.

1355
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,120
-'He's up again!' What a character!
-[laughter]

1356
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,920
I love it when you come out the bath
and you've got two red feet,

1357
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,640
one red arm and a couple of red balls.

1358
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,800
I just love it.

1359
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,800
[laughter]

1360
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,160
I miss you when you're away.

1361
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:14,280
I get worried about you getting bitten
by sharks in Australia.

1362
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:17,360
I worry about you slipping
on that big dick on the sex floor.

1363
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,400
[laughter]

1364
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,600
I know you're not a robot.

1365
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,840
You're one of the most genuine people
I've ever known in my entire life.

1366
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,280
I love you. I'm obsessed.
You know when you go out the house?

1367
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,800
I... I know it's irrational,
but I worry that you might be dead.

1368
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,600
I get it in my head that he's only
gone and died, my master,

1369
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,840
the true love of my life's
gone and died on me.

1370
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,080
And then when you come home,

1371
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,080
I'm the happiest dog
in the whole wide world

1372
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,880
'cause I'm a five-star love dog!"

1373
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,160
-[cheering and applause]
-[normal voice] That's my dog.

1374
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,320
Five stars.

1375
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,320
Very loving.

1376
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:53,640
I went on the website to see dogs
that don't get five stars for love.

1377
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,800
One star,

1378
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,520
the chihuahua.

1379
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,080
[laughter]

1380
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,640
Those little Mexican dogs
with the googly eyes,

1381
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,200
they don't like people.

1382
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,120
[laughter]

1383
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,000
'Cause you run
into different breeds of dogs,

1384
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,880
because you take the dog,
dog owners know this,

1385
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,960
you take them to the park
and they want to sniff around and stuff,

1386
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,240
they want to meet other dogs.

1387
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,520
And they see them.
It's amazing when they spot each other.

1388
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,200
And basically, what they want to do,

1389
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,480
well, what my dog wants to do,

1390
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,200
is have a little, very brief encounter
with the other dog

1391
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,680
which involves smelling each other's balls
and then carrying on.

1392
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,120
It's very odd. He goes up to a dog,

1393
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,680
"Excuse me, mate,
is it all right if I smell your balls?"

1394
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,080
Then the other dog goes, "Yeah, whatever,"
and then they... [sniffing]

1395
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,720
And then he's, "Have a go on mine."

1396
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,440
And then they go, "Thanks for that,"
and then they just carry on.

1397
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,520
[laughter]

1398
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,200
And they spot each other from miles away.

1399
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,720
[laughter]

1400
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,400
And the other dog looks at him.

1401
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,000
And then, sometimes, dogs are mean.

1402
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,080
They don't want to smell,
'cause he's a little puppy.

1403
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:48,080
Some German shepherd
will be coming along like this,

1404
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,600
[German accent] "I'm the German shepherd.
I'm the German shepherd."

1405
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,800
[normal voice] My dog goes, "Is it alright
if I have a quick sniff on the balls?"

1406
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,440
[German accent]
"Absolutely not, you silly little puppy.

1407
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,800
Look at the size of you.

1408
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,040
You couldn't even get up
to my magnificent balls if you tried!

1409
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:03,000
[laughter]

1410
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,000
You think I'm going to stoop
to your mini balls?

1411
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,600
Disgusting! Stay away from my balls!"

1412
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,480
[laughter]

1413
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,600
[normal voice]
Get a French poodle come along.

1414
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,800
[French accent] "I'm the French poodle."

1415
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,840
[laughter]

1416
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,920
[normal voice] My dog comes. "Excuse me,
I was wondering if I could get a...

1417
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,760
I just got quite badly treated
by a German shepherd.

1418
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,120
I was wondering if I could get
a quick sniff on your balls?"

1419
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,160
[French accent] "Before Brexit, it would
have been fine, but I'm not happy.

1420
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,080
[laughter]

1421
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,080
I don't think you made the right decision,
no. You have not made the right decision.

1422
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,880
-You know?
-[applause]

1423
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,640
Maybe before, but now I don't like it.

1424
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:39,720
The way you vote
is very rude to the French people.

1425
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,600
You're not part of this anymore, you know?

1426
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,960
You want free movement of people?

1427
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,960
Well, you don't get free movement
of your nose to my balls, not anymore.

1428
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,400
[laughter]

1429
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:48,680
Get away from the balls."

1430
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,600
[laughter]

1431
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,520
[normal voice] Afghan hound coming over.

1432
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:55,160
[Afghan accent] "Please, don't touch my...
In normal circumstances I would,

1433
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,000
but things very difficult in my country.

1434
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,160
I have to go home.

1435
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,200
Very many unrest in my region.
I must go watch CNN.

1436
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,160
Please, balls are not available
right now."

1437
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,080
[laughter]

1438
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,120
[normal voice] Once in a while
you get lovely dogs,

1439
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,120
like a little Scottish terrier
comes along.

1440
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,920
[Scottish accent] "Ooh, hello!
Ah, fucking feast on those, pal!

1441
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,120
[laughter]

1442
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:14,760
Get your face right in!

1443
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,480
Go on, I'm in no rush whatsoever!

1444
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,840
I'll have a go on yours in a minute.
Just enjoy!

1445
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,400
Get right the fuck in there, pal!"

1446
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,880
[laughter]

1447
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,360
[normal voice] But chihuahuas?

1448
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,320
Oh, every time...
Every time you see a chihuahua,

1449
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,640
the owner's like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Careful!

1450
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,640
He's a bit nippy."

1451
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:38,840
[laughter]

1452
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,080
And you can see it in his eyes.
I'd be like,

1453
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,760
"Of course-- of course he's a bit nippy,

1454
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,760
he's a one-star love dog.

1455
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:45,880
Do your research."

1456
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,120
See him going, [Mexican accent]
"I'm a one-star love dog,

1457
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,080
I don't know why she bought me.
I don't like her.

1458
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,640
-I don't like other people.
-[laughter]

1459
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,240
Why she not do her research
on the internet?

1460
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,160
[laughter]

1461
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,560
When she tries to come close to me,
I try to bite her,

1462
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,440
'cause I don't like her face,

1463
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:05,800
I don't like her children, her husband.

1464
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,240
-[biting]
-[laughter]

1465
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,120
You know when she goes out of the house,

1466
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,600
I hope she's dead.

1467
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,080
I do, I pray for her death.

1468
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,000
[laughter]

1469
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,680
And get me out of your handbag,
you fucking witch!"

1470
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,880
[laughter]

1471
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,920
One star.

1472
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,680
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you so much for coming out

1473
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:28,080
and sharing this super fun night with me!

1474
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,480
Thank you very much! Goodnight! Bravo!

1475
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,840
[cheering and applause]

1476
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,360
Yay! Nice people!

1477
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,120
Thank you!

1478
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,600
Thank you at the top!

1479
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,720
Thank you, lovely people!

1480
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,480
[cheering and applause continues]

1481
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,840
Thank you! Thank you all!
Goodnight! Bravo!

1482
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,960
[Michael chuckles]

1483
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,880
Woo-hoo!

1484
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,640
[cheering and applause continues]
