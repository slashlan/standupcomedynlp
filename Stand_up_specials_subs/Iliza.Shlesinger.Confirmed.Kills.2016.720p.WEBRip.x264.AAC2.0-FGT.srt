1
00:00:00,911 --> 00:00:03,080
[gun cocks and fires]

2
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:05,987
[cheering and applause]

3
00:00:10,408 --> 00:00:13,537
[announcer] <i>Chicago, are you ready?</i>

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,997
[cheering and applause]

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:20,043
<i>Party goblins, are you ready?</i>

6
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:21,711
[cheering and applause]

7
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:23,338
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

8
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:25,173
<i>please welcome to the stage,</i>

9
00:00:25,257 --> 00:00:27,425
<i>Iliza!</i>

10
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:31,513
[cheering and applause]

11
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:40,729
[cheering and applause]

12
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:47,403
- Chicago!
- [cheering]

13
00:00:47,486 --> 00:00:49,488
- Thank you!
- [cheering]

14
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:52,699
Thank you for having me.

15
00:00:52,783 --> 00:00:55,286
I'd like to discuss something with you.

16
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:59,456
There are two kinds of hungover.

17
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,250
[laughter]

18
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,420
There's the kind of hungover
where you wake up the next morning

19
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:08,007
and you're like,
"What? I touched his penis over his jeans?

20
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,385
- It's okay, I'm sassy." And then...
- [laughter]

21
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:16,432
there's the kind of hungover
where whatever happened the night before

22
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:18,684
wasn't even your fault.

23
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,269
[laughter]

24
00:01:20,352 --> 00:01:23,981
Because you weren't mentally present
for any of it.

25
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:25,691
[laughter]

26
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:29,611
[in croaky voice] For 'twas not you
that was is charge.

27
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:31,029
[laughter]

28
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:34,616
'Twas your party goblin!

29
00:01:34,699 --> 00:01:37,410
[cheering and applause]

30
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:39,245
Yeah.

31
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:45,210
Just so you know, your party goblin
sleeps in the back of your brain.

32
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:47,670
For those of you
that are unfamiliar with my work,

33
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,631
she sleeps in the back of your brain

34
00:01:49,714 --> 00:01:52,467
and she waits... [snorts]
on a pile of rags... [snorts]

35
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,054
and regrets... [snorts]
and old Tiger Beat magazines. She waits!

36
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:58,723
- [laughter]
- For the perfect opportunity.

37
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,433
[laughter]

38
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:02,435
She's back there in your brain,

39
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:04,479
sleeping her goblin sleep, just...

40
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:07,482
- [snorts and sighs]
- [laughter]

41
00:02:07,565 --> 00:02:09,776
- [snorts and sighs]
- [laughter]

42
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:12,028
[snorts] Channing Tatum, stick of butter.
[snorts]

43
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:14,864
[laughter]

44
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,783
[applause]

45
00:02:18,784 --> 00:02:21,328
- And she will awaken...
- [laughter]

46
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:23,413
when she hears you say...

47
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:27,542
"I guess I'll just come out
for one drink."

48
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:29,211
[snarls]

49
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:31,838
[laughter and applause]

50
00:02:31,922 --> 00:02:34,841
[cheering]

51
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:40,889
"I'll just come out for one

52
00:02:40,973 --> 00:02:42,891
because I have to be up early."

53
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:45,310
[screams]

54
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,481
Eat that sandwich out of the garbage

55
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:51,483
and text your ex-boyfriend
that you love him

56
00:02:51,566 --> 00:02:54,152
then turn your phone off!

57
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:57,406
[cheering]

58
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,326
[cheering and applause]

59
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:08,499
And by the way, there is zero culpability
on the part of your party goblin.

60
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:10,835
She's not there the next morning

61
00:03:10,918 --> 00:03:13,504
like, "Oh, my God, are you okay?
Do you need Pedialyte?"

62
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:14,630
No!

63
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,048
She doesn't give a fuck.

64
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:19,343
She straight up ghosts at, like, 3:00 a.m.

65
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:23,097
when you're shit-faced
in the back of an Uber, right?

66
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,391
You scooped yourself
into the back of this car.

67
00:03:25,474 --> 00:03:28,477
Your crowing achievement of the evening
is that you didn't die.

68
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:30,021
[laughter]

69
00:03:30,104 --> 00:03:32,398
And we've all had that moment.

70
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:35,484
Anybody that's been out drinking,
you've been out, it's been loud,

71
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:39,780
there's been yelling, dancing, you stole
an ambulance, it's been a crazy night.

72
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:43,993
We've all had that moment
of solitary drunken serenity

73
00:03:44,076 --> 00:03:46,704
where you get in the back of the car
and you shut the door

74
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:49,373
and for the first time all night
it's quiet.

75
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:50,374
[laughter]

76
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:53,210
And you think, "Oh, my God, I made it."

77
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:56,130
[laughter]

78
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:58,090
Followed by, "I'm gonna throw up."

79
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:01,259
And the car is going,
you're like, "Oh, fuck!"

80
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:03,011
You're trying to hold it in, right?

81
00:04:03,094 --> 00:04:05,847
You roll the window down.
You're like, "Agh! It's too much air!"

82
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,308
You roll the window back up.
You're like, "Too much me!"

83
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:10,435
You crack the window. You're like, "No!"

84
00:04:10,518 --> 00:04:15,106
The vomit's coming up. It's right here,
like A1 Steak Sauce, it gets you here.

85
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,693
You're like, "Uhh!" You're trying to focus
on anything to distract you.

86
00:04:18,777 --> 00:04:20,278
You're listening to the radio.

87
00:04:20,362 --> 00:04:22,655
For the first time ever,
you're paying attention

88
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:24,741
to the words of a Pitbull song.

89
00:04:24,824 --> 00:04:26,618
- You're like...
- [laughter]

90
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:29,162
<i># Uno, dos, tres... #</i>
We get it! We get it!

91
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,413
[laughter]

92
00:04:30,497 --> 00:04:34,084
You look at party goblin, she's loving it.
She's got her head out her window like...

93
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,668
[screams]

94
00:04:35,752 --> 00:04:37,462
[laughter]

95
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:40,131
And you know
it's your party goblin that got you

96
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:43,051
by the manner in which
you wake up the next morning.

97
00:04:43,134 --> 00:04:45,261
If you wake up. If you wake up, Chicago.

98
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:46,471
[laughter]

99
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:50,307
You wake up... When party goblin gets you,
you wake up on your couch.

100
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:53,394
Beds are for closers.
You wake up on your couch, okay?

101
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:56,605
You ever pass out on a pillow so hard,

102
00:04:56,688 --> 00:04:59,400
you get a cushion scar
down the side of your face?

103
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:02,403
[laughter]

104
00:05:02,486 --> 00:05:05,948
And you wake up, no idea where you are,
no idea where you were.

105
00:05:06,031 --> 00:05:09,743
You check your wrist, it's just
a dirty patchwork of entry stamps.

106
00:05:09,827 --> 00:05:11,161
[laughter]

107
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,621
Putting the pieces together

108
00:05:12,704 --> 00:05:15,124
from the night before
is like the plot from <i>Memento.</i>

109
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,250
No idea.

110
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:17,333
[laughter]

111
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:20,963
You check your Instagram feed,
it's a blurry feed of pictures

112
00:05:21,046 --> 00:05:23,090
you took of your own face from this angle.

113
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,050
[laughter and cheering]

114
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:28,762
It's just me and three girls in a bathroom
in East LA like, "Squad goals."

115
00:05:28,846 --> 00:05:30,305
Who the fuck are they?

116
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:31,723
[laughter]

117
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:34,226
I don't know,
but I think I'm in the gang now, right?

118
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,271
No idea what you did the night before.

119
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:41,315
We... I... You know when party goblin
gets you by the amount that you sleep.

120
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,193
I slept for 15 hours the other day.

121
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,822
- I slept so long, my muscles atrophied.
- [laughter]

122
00:05:47,905 --> 00:05:49,615
Okay? I turned to fucking stone.

123
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:50,575
You ever pass out

124
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,994
with your full body weight
on your hands, like...

125
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:56,247
[laughter]

126
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,917
No blood in, no blood out. Your hands
are just purple, bloated flippers.

127
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,752
[laughter]

128
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:03,963
I slept so long, I almost died.

129
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:06,424
Like, there was a point
at around 4:00 p.m.

130
00:06:06,507 --> 00:06:09,635
where my soul was like,
"Should I just go?"

131
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:12,930
[laughter]

132
00:06:13,014 --> 00:06:15,808
[cheering]

133
00:06:18,477 --> 00:06:20,271
There's different kinds of drunk.

134
00:06:20,354 --> 00:06:24,066
Some people think they get smarter when
they're drunk, some people wanna talk.

135
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,612
The Latin phrase is <i>in vino veritas,</i>
which means, "in wine, there's truth,"

136
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:30,656
which is why when girls get drunk,
we're always like,

137
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,699
"Can I just tell you a secret?"

138
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:35,952
[laughter and applause]

139
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,708
[laughter]

140
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,544
"I don't have a neck."

141
00:06:44,628 --> 00:06:45,921
[laughter]

142
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,301
I don't really make
a lot of drunk mistakes

143
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:54,471
but I worry when I make dumb decisions
when I'm drunk for this simple fact.

144
00:06:54,554 --> 00:06:57,057
In my group of friends, I'm the alpha.

145
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,184
I decide what we do. Obviously.

146
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:03,313
I pick the restaurants, I pick the bars,
mostly because no one cares,

147
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:05,106
but I am the decision-maker.

148
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,693
And what worries me is,
if I'm doing stupid shit when I'm drunk,

149
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:11,696
what hope do the sheep who I lead have...

150
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,032
[cheering and applause]

151
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,909
if that's my example?

152
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,037
So this is the story of one such night.

153
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,081
So, we were out the other night
and we were

154
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:22,248
shit-canned.

155
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:26,418
Like, the kind of drunk
where you can't even read.

156
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:29,004
[applause]

157
00:07:29,088 --> 00:07:32,591
And then you realize it's because...
you're in China Town.

158
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:35,010
[laughter]

159
00:07:35,094 --> 00:07:37,513
[cheering]

160
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,515
[applause]

161
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:43,102
[laughter]

162
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:47,398
Actually, you know you're fucked up when
you're in China Town and you <i>can </i>read.

163
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:50,109
Ohhh!

164
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:53,612
- Ancient secrets, not so hidden. So...
- [laughter]

165
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:59,410
We're drunk and we're walking through
China Town and we walk into a bar.

166
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,662
I'm reticent to say that it's a club
because I'm 33,

167
00:08:01,745 --> 00:08:04,706
but there was a dance floor, a DJ
and I had on a little body glitter, okay!

168
00:08:04,748 --> 00:08:07,835
[laughter]

169
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,213
You're probably wondering,
"Why are you wearing body glitter?"

170
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:12,880
I will tell you, Chicago.

171
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:16,384
Because my date was late to pick me up.
Gentlemen!

172
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:18,428
[laughter]

173
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:20,388
You need to know this about women.

174
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:24,058
When we get ready,
we have a list of things we do

175
00:08:24,142 --> 00:08:26,227
to reach our most attractive point.

176
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:30,273
There is an apex,
nay, a pinnacle of beauty...

177
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:33,067
that women reach
when they're getting ready.

178
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:35,153
And every minute you're late to get us

179
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:37,655
is one more minute
we spend doubting ourselves,

180
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:41,242
dicking with our makeup,
and we get incrementally uglier...

181
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:43,661
- [laughter]
- as time goes on.

182
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:46,789
[cheering and applause]

183
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,587
One time, my date was an hour late,
I grew a tail.

184
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,672
[laughter]

185
00:08:55,256 --> 00:08:57,550
This guy was only 30 minutes late,
thank God.

186
00:08:57,634 --> 00:09:01,387
He walks in, I'm on the ground,
there's caboodle shrapnel everywhere.

187
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:04,306
I've got a Wet N Wild lip gloss wand,

188
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:06,099
I'm like, "I'm a pretty girl!"

189
00:09:06,183 --> 00:09:07,809
[laughter]

190
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,436
"Save yourself."

191
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,063
[laughter]

192
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,732
But what happens is, we have time,

193
00:09:13,815 --> 00:09:16,818
so we start to add things,
doubt ourselves.

194
00:09:16,902 --> 00:09:19,488
- That's where I found that glitter.
- [laughter]

195
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:21,698
"He's not here. [gasps] What's this?"

196
00:09:22,532 --> 00:09:26,036
In hindsight, it wasn't body glitter,
it was straight-up craft glitter.

197
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,371
[laughter]

198
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:29,915
But I was like, "I'm gonna put it
on my face, make it dainty."

199
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:33,460
Do you ever feel that? Do you ever feel
that you can make something work?

200
00:09:33,543 --> 00:09:35,921
Do you ever feel that
because you're not trashy,

201
00:09:36,004 --> 00:09:38,632
you can pull off
doing something that's trashy?

202
00:09:38,715 --> 00:09:41,343
[cheering]

203
00:09:43,136 --> 00:09:46,264
You're like, "I can wear
fishnet stockings, I went to Stanford."

204
00:09:46,348 --> 00:09:48,183
Like it's okay for some reason.

205
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:49,810
[laughter]

206
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:51,645
That's how I felt about that body glitter.

207
00:09:51,728 --> 00:09:54,855
I was like, "I'll just do a little bit.
I'll do a classy amount.

208
00:09:54,939 --> 00:09:56,691
I'm just gonna do a little bit."

209
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,735
Fun fact, you know what body glitter
up close looks like? Conjunctivitis.

210
00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:01,779
- Like, real up close.
- [laughter]

211
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:06,867
"I'll do a little." Five minutes later,
"Maybe just highlight the orbital rim.

212
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:09,036
That way when we're dancing,

213
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,123
the light will hit it and it'll be like,
'Bing, anime! Ah!'

214
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:13,999
Keep going. Keep going."

215
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,752
Five more minutes later,
"Maybe I'll bring a little bit down here

216
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:21,966
and highlight the jawbone so he knows I,
what, come from good chewing stock?"

217
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,175
[laughter]

218
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:26,011
Five more minutes later, sparkle fish!
So now...

219
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,847
[laughter]

220
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,225
I look like a goddamn road flare
and we're in public. So...

221
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,352
[laughter]

222
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:38,691
We walk into this bar and one of
the difficult parts about being a woman,

223
00:10:38,774 --> 00:10:41,026
besides everything, is that...

224
00:10:41,777 --> 00:10:42,862
It's really hard.

225
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:46,322
Is that you're constantly battling
with yourself.

226
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:50,452
In the long run, we're battling
our weight, hair color, wrinkles.

227
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:54,581
Minute to minute, it's just
an adjustment of your hair and your bra

228
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:56,416
and your underwear and your makeup

229
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,260
and your mustache,
braid it, bead it, set it.

230
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,795
- You're always doing something.
- [laughter]

231
00:11:01,421 --> 00:11:05,300
Because if one thing is off,
then the night is ruined, Scott, okay?

232
00:11:06,217 --> 00:11:08,553
One time,
I left my house without mascara on.

233
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:12,432
I did a U-turn on a four-lane highway.
Like, "No!"

234
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:13,349
[laughter]

235
00:11:13,433 --> 00:11:16,144
"They will see the whites of my eyes!"

236
00:11:16,227 --> 00:11:18,605
[laughter]

237
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:23,276
Everything has to be perfect.
And guys, it's exhausting.

238
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,069
It's exhausting being a girl.

239
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:27,947
Did you know, fun scientific fact
that I made up on the way here,

240
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,993
that women get four minutes
out of every night,

241
00:11:32,076 --> 00:11:34,537
four minutes out of every night

242
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,663
where our brain sends a message
to our body saying,

243
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:38,832
"Everything's okay, stop messing with it"?

244
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,168
Four minutes out of every night

245
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,462
where your brain sends a message
to your body like,

246
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:45,839
"Homeostasis achieved." You're like...

247
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:48,800
[laughter]

248
00:11:48,884 --> 00:11:52,471
[cheering and applause]

249
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:57,851
And the rest of the time,
it's just mayhem!

250
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:02,481
Everything has to be perfect. So,
we walk into this bar, my first thought...

251
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,734
"I gotta fix my lip liner. Now!"

252
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:06,860
[laughter]

253
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:09,279
I'm not even a big lip liner wearer,

254
00:12:09,363 --> 00:12:11,323
but in that moment, 'twas everything.

255
00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:14,451
In that moment,
I believed fixing my lip liner

256
00:12:14,535 --> 00:12:17,079
is what stood between me
and eternal happiness, okay?

257
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:21,625
I had to take a liner, I had to find
my liner and line my chola lips, okay?

258
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:23,335
- That's what I had to do.
- [applause]

259
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:26,796
So glad that got a response.
In North Carolina, nothing. Okay.

260
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,673
[laughter]

261
00:12:28,756 --> 00:12:33,261
[cheering and applause]

262
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,848
Had to fix my lip liner,
had to be right then.

263
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:39,976
To the gentlemen in the room,

264
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:42,436
I don't expect you
to understand the urgency

265
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,397
with which I had to fix my lip liner.

266
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,692
The only thing I could liken it to
in male culture is, like...

267
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,736
when you feel
you have to adjust your balls.

268
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,821
[laughter]

269
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,739
Similar immediacy.

270
00:12:54,532 --> 00:12:56,617
As we've seen, unfortunately.

271
00:12:56,701 --> 00:12:58,327
[laughter]

272
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:02,582
When you feel that's gotta happen,
it's gotta happen now! Go! Go! Go!

273
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:06,377
In front of children, Christmas Eve,
family portrait, messing with my dick.

274
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,628
[laughter and cheering]

275
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:10,715
<i># Messing with my dick in public #</i>

276
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:12,174
Wahoo!

277
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:16,095
<i># It's a dick puzzle
and I'm solving it now #</i>

278
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:18,555
<i># Maximum comfort at any cost #</i>

279
00:13:18,638 --> 00:13:20,682
<i># This is my right,
Nancy, get off my back #</i>

280
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:22,642
- So...
- [laughter]

281
00:13:22,726 --> 00:13:25,854
So many guys right now have to adjust.
They're like, "I'm not gonna do it!"

282
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,356
[laughter]

283
00:13:29,357 --> 00:13:31,151
[laughter]

284
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,278
I believe that's what Elvis was doing.

285
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:35,530
[laughter]

286
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,990
Makes sense.

287
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:42,704
Needed my liner. Now you understand
that I needed it, guys, okay?

288
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:47,459
Needed the fucking liner. That means
I had to find the liner in my bag.

289
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:52,672
- However, I had a big bag.
- [laughter]

290
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:56,384
There's a very specific way
that women will search for something

291
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,428
when we have a big bag.

292
00:13:58,511 --> 00:14:02,599
What do you do?
You take a designated search claw...

293
00:14:02,682 --> 00:14:04,559
[laughter]

294
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,436
and you plunge it.

295
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:09,355
[laughter]

296
00:14:10,731 --> 00:14:13,817
[cheering]

297
00:14:13,901 --> 00:14:16,403
[applause]

298
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:21,075
Never breaking eye contact with your prey,
I mean your date.

299
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:22,701
[laughter]

300
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,704
Notice I haven't blinked, Chicago.
Dedication acting.

301
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:29,333
[cheering]

302
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,752
[applause]

303
00:14:31,835 --> 00:14:34,171
The constant eye contact
being a reminder that,

304
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:38,384
yes, I can multitask and keep talking.
I'll make a great partner. Marry me.

305
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,970
[laughter]

306
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,721
Meanwhile, to the outside world,

307
00:14:42,805 --> 00:14:45,432
it looks like you're wrestling
with a very small bass.

308
00:14:46,183 --> 00:14:48,394
If you're a pro,
you keep conversation moving.

309
00:14:48,477 --> 00:14:49,478
Still haven't blinked.

310
00:14:49,561 --> 00:14:51,814
If you're a pro,
you keep conversation moving.

311
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:54,692
"I'm listening. Keep talking.
Keep talking. I can look and listen.

312
00:14:54,775 --> 00:14:57,236
Say FanDuel one more time, motherfucker.
I'm listening."

313
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,780
[laughter and applause]

314
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:05,660
You're digging around in there.
Meanwhile, as a woman,

315
00:15:05,743 --> 00:15:08,830
you're having to come to terms
with the seventh layer of hell

316
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:11,040
that is the bottom of your bag.

317
00:15:11,124 --> 00:15:15,753
It's just a graveyard of dismembered pens,
there's coins.

318
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:21,509
Why is there always a Nature's Valley
granola bar crumbled... at the bottom?

319
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:24,595
[cheering and applause]

320
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:28,808
You stick your hand down, you come up
with oats between your fingernails.

321
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:30,518
You're like, "Ow! Ow!"

322
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,687
[laughter]

323
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,273
Digging around.
A gym lock, a phone charger,

324
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:36,524
a concealer without its lid.

325
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:38,317
Why? Why can't we make them

326
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,111
with retractable lids
that don't break off?

327
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:42,071
Because you stick your hand down there,

328
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:45,533
unknowingly you come up
with one creamy finger. You're like, "No!"

329
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:48,036
- [laughter]
- "No!"

330
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:50,579
But it was expensive,
so you're like, "No!"

331
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,664
[laughter]

332
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:55,375
[cheering]

333
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,045
So now you look amazing.
Keep looking, keep looking.

334
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:01,173
Bits of paper. A sock. Keep looking.
Tampon out of its wrapper.

335
00:16:01,256 --> 00:16:03,717
Maybe I keep it.
No, I'll get sick. Digging around.

336
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:06,053
If it's out of the wrapper, don't keep it.

337
00:16:06,136 --> 00:16:08,930
Sometimes it's like, "I'll just..."
Don't blow on it and...

338
00:16:09,014 --> 00:16:12,267
You're gonna get dysentery,
you'll never finish the Oregon Trail.

339
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:14,770
[laughter and cheering]

340
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,779
Seven or eight seconds go by,
I cannot find my lip liner.

341
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:27,324
Seven or eight seconds go by,
which in girl years is, like, forever,

342
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:29,117
I cannot find my lip liner.

343
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:31,828
So, what's a logical thing to do?

344
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:33,288
Maybe use the other hand

345
00:16:33,371 --> 00:16:35,874
to add to the search, right?
To aid in the excavation.

346
00:16:35,957 --> 00:16:39,586
Maybe get a cellular device
to illuminate the situation.

347
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:43,089
Not me!
I dropped to my knees on a dance floor,

348
00:16:43,172 --> 00:16:45,716
dumped out the bag
and start sifting through it

349
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,844
like Helen Keller
learning how to spell water.

350
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:52,431
[laughter and applause]

351
00:16:56,143 --> 00:16:59,063
Fun fact. Girls,
if you wanna let people around you know

352
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:02,983
that you're absolutely not
on the same mental playing field as them,

353
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:06,570
a great way to do it, I found,
is to dump our personal property

354
00:17:06,654 --> 00:17:11,158
onto a shared communal space, because that
immediately lets other bar-goers know,

355
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:12,493
"I don't give a fuck!"

356
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:14,078
[laughter]

357
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:15,830
"Where is it?"

358
00:17:16,664 --> 00:17:19,542
This body language, this body language,

359
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:23,170
- this feral-raccoon-like body language...
- [laughter]

360
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:25,881
was enough to alert the door guy.

361
00:17:25,965 --> 00:17:27,007
[laughter]

362
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:30,427
You're a door guy at a busy nightclub,
you've got a lot to deal with.

363
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:35,557
However, he found
my witch over a cauldron behavior...

364
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:39,936
threatening enough to leave his post,
flashlight in hand,

365
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:42,147
and walk up to me.

366
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,651
He was a big guy. He was, like, six-eight,
black guy, good-looking.

367
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,361
[laughter]

368
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:51,114
- I had to say he was good-looking.
- [laughter]

369
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,032
Because I said he was black.

370
00:17:53,116 --> 00:17:56,578
[laughter]

371
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:01,583
Seems to be the face of thinly-veiled
political correctness in our country,

372
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:03,960
if you say someone's color,
other than white,

373
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:06,754
you must assign them an accolade,
deserved or otherwise,

374
00:18:06,838 --> 00:18:09,215
to prove that you're not racist,
when in the first place,

375
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,508
I wasn't fucking racist,

376
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:14,053
I was giving you an accurate depiction
of the events that transpired.

377
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:17,140
I didn't see his face!
Dude had a flashlight in my eye!

378
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:19,392
[laughter]

379
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:23,270
[cheering and applause]

380
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:28,525
I can tell you this much. Black, white
or other, there's no way he was hot.

381
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,029
He's six-eight. They get weird-looking
after a certain height, okay?

382
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,323
Structurally, it gets weird. Okay.

383
00:18:34,406 --> 00:18:37,326
I am not wrong. #IAmNotWrong
Okay, so...

384
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,453
[laughter]

385
00:18:39,536 --> 00:18:40,829
It's true.

386
00:18:41,705 --> 00:18:43,165
There's no hot giants.

387
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,958
[laughter]

388
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,002
So he Shreks up to me...

389
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,255
[laughter]

390
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,592
And I feel his presence and I see
the ball of light and I hear his voice

391
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:56,303
and he goes,
"Everything a'ight over here?"

392
00:18:56,386 --> 00:19:00,724
Fucking no, dude, everything is most
definitely not a'ight. I'm on the floor.

393
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,934
[laughter]

394
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,770
I don't exist on this plane.

395
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:07,814
Fun fact about being on the floor.

396
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:11,944
As an adult, when you choose to take it
to this place, you lose all credibility.

397
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,363
Nobody wants to hear the prerogative
of someone on the floor.

398
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:20,243
If you have to crane your neck up
to explain yourself, you are fucked, okay?

399
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,036
You don't believe me?

400
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:25,248
You ever tried to get the life story
of someone sitting on a curb? No.

401
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,012
Because they were sitting
on a fucking curb

402
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,918
and you didn't wanna talk to them.

403
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,254
They were someone who's drunk,
on a lot of meth

404
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:35,258
or like a really pissed off bridesmaid
just waiting for the service to be over.

405
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,051
[laughter]

406
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,596
But now I'm on the floor and I'm nervous
because that's an authority figure

407
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,557
and in my head I'm like,
"Oh, fuck, I'm gonna go a bar jail."

408
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:45,268
[laughter]

409
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,436
"What if they repossess my wedges?"

410
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,188
[laughter]

411
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,023
But I was drunk and in my head I'm like,

412
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,401
"It's cool. Be smart.
Explain what you're doing.

413
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,569
Whatever you do, Iliza,
just sound intelligent."

414
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,822
Instead, what came out of my mouth was,

415
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,366
"I gotta find my lip liner, man!" And...

416
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,575
[laughter]

417
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,912
what I feel he understood,
nay respected, nay...

418
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,622
Neigh.

419
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,375
[laughter]

420
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,546
[cheering and applause]

421
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,633
resonated with

422
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,760
wasn't that I had to find my lip liner.

423
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:25,932
What I feel he understood was
the sheer amount of white-girl crazy...

424
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,058
[laughter]

425
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,102
coming out from behind my eye.

426
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:33,481
Because he then gave me
the international verbal sign for,

427
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:37,986
"I respect you and fear you,
I'm going to back off," which is...

428
00:20:38,903 --> 00:20:41,614
"A'ight, then." And he just walked away.

429
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,909
[laughter and applause]

430
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,871
[cheering]

431
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,542
I never found my lip liner.
It was, like, in my other bag.

432
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,710
[laughter]

433
00:20:54,793 --> 00:20:56,837
I didn't like that experience.

434
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,714
I didn't like being on the floor.

435
00:20:58,797 --> 00:21:01,633
And I didn't like being on the floor
for a very specific reason.

436
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:04,053
As a woman, I didn't need a reminder

437
00:21:04,136 --> 00:21:08,390
of how vulnerable women are
on a day-to-day basis.

438
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:10,851
Being on the floor,
it's a very vulnerable place.

439
00:21:10,934 --> 00:21:12,102
I didn't need that reminder.

440
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,646
And women in our society are vulnerable

441
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,318
by virtue of the fact that we are
physically not as strong as men.

442
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:22,363
That's the root of the issue,
that's the root of the oppression.

443
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:25,866
And that's the root of oppression
of any side of war throughout history.

444
00:21:25,949 --> 00:21:28,494
One side was stronger,
they get to make the rules.

445
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:32,039
Do you think for a second that
if women were physically stronger than men

446
00:21:32,122 --> 00:21:35,167
we would've waited for the right to vote?

447
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,004
[cheering]

448
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,673
[applause]

449
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:46,803
It's 1910, some jacked-up housewife
is just putting up weight in her garage.

450
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:50,348
She's got a shaker
of horse testosterone and creatine.

451
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,644
Her little husband comes in,
he's like, "You're not voting."

452
00:21:54,727 --> 00:21:56,437
She'd be like...

453
00:21:56,521 --> 00:21:58,731
"Out of the way, Jedediah."

454
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:01,359
[laughter]

455
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:05,196
[cheering]

456
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:13,579
"Mama's going to the polls."

457
00:22:13,663 --> 00:22:15,665
[laughter]

458
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:18,292
It's physical strength,
that's the root of the issue.

459
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:20,920
Physical strength.
And they try to placate women.

460
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:23,089
They try to tell us
we're other types of strong.

461
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:25,716
Sure. But none that matter
as much as physical strength.

462
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,553
"Well, you're a woman,
so... mentally strong."

463
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,138
[laughter]

464
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:33,141
Mentally strong.
You put up with him all day, huh?"

465
00:22:33,224 --> 00:22:34,433
Pfft!

466
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:37,352
[laughter]

467
00:22:37,435 --> 00:22:40,397
Mentally strong.
Mentally strong? What do I do with that?

468
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,234
Mentally strong. What do I do
when a rapist runs at me? Math?

469
00:22:44,317 --> 00:22:47,195
[laughter]

470
00:22:49,906 --> 00:22:51,950
It's physical strength.

471
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:55,328
Physical strength is what counts
when it comes to protecting yourself

472
00:22:55,412 --> 00:22:59,708
and women are only naturally
physically super-human strong

473
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,042
when it comes to two things.

474
00:23:01,126 --> 00:23:03,879
The first is a recent one,
and that's CrossFit, which...

475
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:07,132
It's enough, by the way.
It's a cult. Okay?

476
00:23:07,215 --> 00:23:08,425
[cheering]

477
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:10,719
It's insane. It goes...

478
00:23:11,469 --> 00:23:15,056
Scientology, CrossFit, people without
celiac disease that don't eat gluten.

479
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,809
It's a cult, okay? It's enough.

480
00:23:18,643 --> 00:23:20,979
"I can deadlift 600 pounds." Cool.

481
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:23,064
What Starbucks do you work at?
What are you...

482
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:24,900
Guard a village. Join up.

483
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:28,152
What are you doing with that muscle,
all the horse meat?

484
00:23:29,236 --> 00:23:32,990
The workouts that they're doing,
it's all snake oil, I believe, okay?

485
00:23:33,073 --> 00:23:37,286
Push-ups, sit-ups, pull-ups,
the foundations of a military workout,

486
00:23:37,369 --> 00:23:39,496
these are applicable
in the rest of your life.

487
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,627
Instead, they've got a father of six
at 7 a.m. flipping a monster truck tire?

488
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,421
Why? When do you need that?

489
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,256
When do you need
to know the form for that?

490
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,635
What post-apocalyptic
gorilla playground...

491
00:23:52,718 --> 00:23:53,928
[laughter]

492
00:23:54,011 --> 00:23:55,513
are you gonna find yourself in?

493
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:59,350
Why don't we give you an empty suitcase
to throw around your cage, Peaches?

494
00:23:59,433 --> 00:24:02,561
[laughter and applause]

495
00:24:02,645 --> 00:24:07,274
And the rope thing. There are other ways
to build up your pectoral muscles.

496
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:09,735
Men have been doing it for centuries.

497
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:12,863
Instead they've got you using a rope.
When are you gonna use that?

498
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:16,908
"Timmy's stuck down by the dock
under some boat rope!" "I got it!"

499
00:24:16,991 --> 00:24:18,826
[laughter]

500
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,496
[cheering and applause]

501
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:30,255
And the only time that women are
naturally, exceptionally physically strong

502
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:33,508
is when it comes to childbirth.
And that's amazing.

503
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:35,009
- [cheering]
- Yes.

504
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:39,138
It'd be amazing if those were all men
with, like, really high-pitched voices.

505
00:24:39,222 --> 00:24:41,849
[laughter]

506
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,103
It's an amazing amount
of super-human strength

507
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:49,357
that unfairly women only get to tap into
when they're having a baby.

508
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,528
You only get to tap into that super-human
strength once, maybe twice a year,

509
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:57,240
but that second baby's gonna be very tiny.
You only get to use it then.

510
00:24:57,323 --> 00:24:59,367
That's a disproportionate
amount of strength.

511
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,369
Mother Nature is playing
a cruel joke on us.

512
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:05,164
Do you know how many pounds of pressure
per square snootch inch it takes

513
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:07,457
to deliver a baby?

514
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:09,042
[laughter]

515
00:25:09,126 --> 00:25:11,044
We're not even using our hands!

516
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:14,047
You're like python-like digesting a goat.

517
00:25:14,131 --> 00:25:15,215
[laughter]

518
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:16,550
"Get out of there!"

519
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:21,013
Using fucking grit and rage and, like,
a mother's love, but just, "Aghh!"

520
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:22,472
[laughter]

521
00:25:22,556 --> 00:25:25,100
Sparta! Just fucking going.

522
00:25:25,183 --> 00:25:26,393
[laughter]

523
00:25:26,476 --> 00:25:28,270
You can do that with your body,

524
00:25:28,353 --> 00:25:32,024
yet the rest of the year, we have trouble
not doing push-ups on our knees.

525
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,775
That doesn't seem fair.

526
00:25:33,859 --> 00:25:35,652
[laughter]

527
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,364
We're only exceptionally strong
when it comes to children.

528
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:41,575
We have something called
mama bear strength.

529
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:44,745
So that means when your child
is in danger, your child,

530
00:25:44,828 --> 00:25:47,331
someone else's child, "Sorry, junior."
Your child...

531
00:25:47,414 --> 00:25:48,707
[laughter]

532
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,543
"Lift the piano off your legs yourself,
okay, I'm not your mama."

533
00:25:51,626 --> 00:25:55,881
When your child is in danger,
in that moment, through adrenaline,

534
00:25:55,964 --> 00:25:58,424
you can develop super-human strength
and save the baby.

535
00:25:58,507 --> 00:26:01,135
So if your child is trapped under a car,

536
00:26:01,218 --> 00:26:04,680
you can go ahead and flip that Buick
like an orangutan, no problem.

537
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:05,765
[laughter]

538
00:26:05,848 --> 00:26:09,143
Yet if you're a single girl
walking alone on a Saturday night

539
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:11,937
and some maniac runs at you,
what's your defense?

540
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:13,981
Like, "No, two plus two is four."

541
00:26:14,065 --> 00:26:16,525
[laughter]

542
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:22,198
We're millennials,
we'd probably use our phone calculators.

543
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,908
[laughter]

544
00:26:23,991 --> 00:26:27,036
That's why sexual harassment
is such a big deal.

545
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:30,414
It really has less to do
with the disgusting thing

546
00:26:30,498 --> 00:26:32,625
a man feels he has the right
to yell at you

547
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,836
out of van or a truck.
Never out of a Civic for some reason.

548
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,088
[cheering]

549
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:40,925
But for the girls that might not know,
you can wear whatever you want.

550
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:43,928
It doesn't give someone the right
to treat you like an animal.

551
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:48,516
[cheering and applause]

552
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,267
You can wear whatever you want.
You can leave the house out naked.

553
00:26:51,351 --> 00:26:54,062
You will go to jail,
but you can do whatever you want.

554
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:57,107
But it has less to do with
what a man is yelling at you,

555
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,067
and nobody wants to say this, but I will,

556
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,861
what it has to do with
is the underlying notion

557
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:04,739
that if that man wanted to act on it,
he could.

558
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:07,450
And if you don't believe me,
every girl knows what it's like,

559
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:11,329
a guy yells something disgusting at you,
and because you're strong, you yell back.

560
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:13,456
He's like, "Nice tits."
You're like, "Fuck off!"

561
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:17,335
Immediately followed by, "What if he
kills me?" Like, there's that moment.

562
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:18,586
[laughter]

563
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,297
Hoping to God
that your bark was big enough

564
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:23,508
that you don't have to take a lady bite.

565
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,011
Being sexually harassed is the worst.

566
00:27:27,095 --> 00:27:29,139
I'm sorry, let me rephrase that.

567
00:27:30,306 --> 00:27:33,893
Being sexually harassed by an ugly guy
is the worst.

568
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:35,937
[laughter]

569
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,982
[cheering and applause]

570
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:42,734
If he's hot, it's just plain old flirting.

571
00:27:42,818 --> 00:27:44,403
[laughter]

572
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:48,031
No one's ever been like, "Get away
from me, you model!" That's fine.

573
00:27:48,115 --> 00:27:49,450
[laughter]

574
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:53,954
It has to do also with
an unrequited, uninvited sexual energy.

575
00:27:54,037 --> 00:27:55,664
And women are very aware of that.

576
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:59,168
Every woman in here knows what it
feels like to have a guy's eyes on you

577
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:01,712
when you find him attractive.
It's the best feeling.

578
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:04,089
When you see hot guys and you walk by,
you're like,

579
00:28:04,173 --> 00:28:08,260
"Hope they're looking at my butt.
I feel so good about my little haunches."

580
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:11,013
When the dudes are gross
and you walk by, you're like,

581
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:14,266
"Please don't look at my butt,
please don't look at my butt."

582
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:18,854
Having someone sexually harass you,
it's their energy on you.

583
00:28:18,937 --> 00:28:20,272
It feels like you're getting shot

584
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,900
with a dick gun.
That's what it feels like.

585
00:28:22,983 --> 00:28:23,817
[laughter]

586
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,319
Minding your own business, like,

587
00:28:25,402 --> 00:28:27,988
"I love being an independent woman."
"Nice tits!"

588
00:28:28,071 --> 00:28:29,281
"Agh!"

589
00:28:29,364 --> 00:28:33,159
[laughter]

590
00:28:33,242 --> 00:28:36,454
[cheering and applause]

591
00:28:42,335 --> 00:28:44,545
Aw, he got a boner for free.

592
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:46,881
[laughter]

593
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:50,092
Women have to think about these things.
It's hard being a girl.

594
00:28:50,176 --> 00:28:53,095
I haven't been a guy in, like, a while,
but it is difficult.

595
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:54,305
[laughter]

596
00:28:54,388 --> 00:28:56,641
And we're constantly questioning ourselves

597
00:28:57,141 --> 00:29:00,728
and we're constantly being told that what
we feel is wrong and how we look is wrong.

598
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:03,648
And we tell it to little girls
and it sticks with us.

599
00:29:03,731 --> 00:29:05,566
Take a man and a woman shopping.

600
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:08,319
Nothing will fit
because fashion is the enemy, for sure.

601
00:29:08,402 --> 00:29:11,072
But nothing will fit the woman
for negative reasons

602
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:13,991
and nothing will fit the guy
for positive reasons.

603
00:29:14,408 --> 00:29:16,077
Take a woman shopping,
"Nothing fits,

604
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,038
my arms are fat, my thighs are big,
I'm fucking gross, I hate my body."

605
00:29:19,121 --> 00:29:22,082
Take a guy shopping,
an average man of average build,

606
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:24,501
five-ten, 170,

607
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:28,713
"Nah, I can't buy off the rack because
my shoulders are so abnormally broad.

608
00:29:29,422 --> 00:29:33,426
I'm tall. For my height, my waist tapers
at such an Adonis-like angle."

609
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:34,678
[laughter]

610
00:29:34,761 --> 00:29:37,514
My dick is so girthy,
I can only wear JNCOs."

611
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:38,598
[laughter]

612
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:40,308
"It's hard for me."

613
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:42,018
[applause]

614
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:44,145
These are good things.

615
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,524
Women are told to change.
It's okay if men are the same.

616
00:29:47,607 --> 00:29:48,900
That's why we have stereotypes.

617
00:29:48,984 --> 00:29:51,319
That's why you've got
the stereotype of your Grandpa,

618
00:29:51,403 --> 00:29:54,406
"I sit in my chair, I drink my beer,
I've got the remote,

619
00:29:54,489 --> 00:29:56,992
I fought in Korea,
don't fucking talk to me," right?

620
00:29:57,075 --> 00:29:58,702
"I'm not moving, you move!"

621
00:29:58,785 --> 00:30:01,413
Women aren't like that, right?
What do women do?

622
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:03,582
- "I'm taking a class."
- [laughter]

623
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:06,042
- Love classes.
- [laughter]

624
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:08,879
- "I'm learning more about Cheryl."
- [laughter]

625
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:12,339
- "I'm meeting Cindy for the first time."
- [laughter]

626
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:15,968
There's two women in this monologue.
I'm two different women, it's fine.

627
00:30:16,051 --> 00:30:18,429
"I'm learning to breathe.
I'm getting a sense of myself.

628
00:30:18,512 --> 00:30:19,763
I'm canning.

629
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:21,682
I'm canning my own beets."

630
00:30:21,765 --> 00:30:23,100
[laughter]

631
00:30:23,183 --> 00:30:24,984
For no reason.
I live in the middle of a city.

632
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,021
I just thought I wanted to connect.

633
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:30,399
I'm canning my own shit now.
I take it, put it in there,

634
00:30:30,482 --> 00:30:33,819
I let it solidify, I make jewelry,
I sell it on Etsy.

635
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:35,029
It's nice pocket money."

636
00:30:35,112 --> 00:30:37,823
[laughter]

637
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:41,035
"I'm learning about myself.
I'm learning to breathe.

638
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:44,079
- I'm cutting my own hair."
- [laughter]

639
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:47,124
"I'm learning to make my own tea,
putting the hair in the tea,

640
00:30:47,207 --> 00:30:48,125
I drink my hair."

641
00:30:48,208 --> 00:30:49,835
[laughter]

642
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:50,753
Changing.

643
00:30:50,836 --> 00:30:52,838
We always wanna change
a little bit, right?

644
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:56,592
Always wanna lose a little bit of weight.
No matter what your body looks like.

645
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:59,470
- "I just wanna lose, like, five pounds."
- [laughter]

646
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:02,114
We think that's the answer.
"Just wanna lose, like, five pounds."

647
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:04,599
[gabbles]

648
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:05,850
[laughter]

649
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:08,561
"Just wanna lose, like,
five pounds before lunch."

650
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:11,147
[laughter]

651
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,149
"So I can have more lunch."

652
00:31:13,232 --> 00:31:16,611
[laughter and cheering]

653
00:31:16,694 --> 00:31:18,947
[applause]

654
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:23,701
Because we think being skinny
is the answer, right?

655
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:27,372
It's not even enough to be skinny, is it?
It's not even enough to be thin, is it?

656
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:30,416
You have to be the thinnest
out of your friends,

657
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,961
- who you hate.
- [laughter]

658
00:31:33,044 --> 00:31:36,714
You don't believe me? Look at any
Instagram picture of more than four women.

659
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:38,716
It's a fucking pose-off.

660
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,842
[laughter]

661
00:31:39,926 --> 00:31:43,888
Dudes don't care. They'll turn
around like gorillas mid-meal. [grunts]

662
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:46,724
"Take the picture, I don't care.
Fucking..."

663
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:49,727
[laughter]

664
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:54,147
Girls, it's like a Mr. Universe, like,
"Fucking line up! Line up!

665
00:31:54,231 --> 00:31:56,984
Make it pointy! Concave!
Make it fucking pointy!

666
00:31:57,067 --> 00:31:58,068
Kisses.

667
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:00,112
Neck vein.
Look at the motherfucking neck vein.

668
00:32:00,195 --> 00:32:01,029
Hamstring.

669
00:32:01,113 --> 00:32:02,948
Happy birthday, Stacey."

670
00:32:03,031 --> 00:32:05,951
[laughter]

671
00:32:06,034 --> 00:32:09,621
[cheering and applause]

672
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:15,419
It's not enough to just be thin, right?

673
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:19,506
You wanna be the kind of thin
where your friends...

674
00:32:21,174 --> 00:32:22,759
are worried for you.

675
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:25,053
[laughter]

676
00:32:26,555 --> 00:32:28,765
[laughter]

677
00:32:32,894 --> 00:32:35,063
[laughter]

678
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:39,401
[laughter and applause]

679
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:43,196
So thin. Horrible looking.

680
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,200
Stalking around Gap Kids.
"I wear a youth large, thank you." Right?

681
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:51,412
- Fucking femur for days.
- [laughter]

682
00:32:51,495 --> 00:32:55,041
Right? Mr. Peanut Legs
coming out six seconds ahead of you.

683
00:32:55,916 --> 00:32:58,502
Like an R. Crumb comic book thinner,
right?

684
00:32:58,586 --> 00:33:01,922
Just walking around,
baby stegosaurus spine.

685
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:05,342
Clothes hanging like moss
off a willow tree.

686
00:33:05,426 --> 00:33:08,262
A fucking clavicle
you can serve soup out of.

687
00:33:08,846 --> 00:33:10,473
Yeah!

688
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:13,017
So happy!

689
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,811
[laughter]

690
00:33:15,895 --> 00:33:17,813
I like my body, but I always...

691
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:21,358
Everybody wants to change something,
right? I just wanted have shoulders

692
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:25,404
that were so frail and tiny,
little bird shoulders.

693
00:33:25,488 --> 00:33:27,740
Do they even have shoulders?
No, it's just...

694
00:33:28,491 --> 00:33:31,452
That's what I want, I want no shoulders.
I want the kind of shoulders

695
00:33:31,535 --> 00:33:33,746
where my bra strap just falls down.

696
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:36,539
- [mumbles weakly]
- [laughter]

697
00:33:36,623 --> 00:33:38,625
Just floppy hair. "Ohh. Whoops."

698
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:40,627
[laughter]

699
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,920
[mumbles weakly]

700
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:44,881
Men love it. They love it. They go crazy.
One strap...

701
00:33:44,964 --> 00:33:47,133
Because it's one less thing
they gotta do, right?

702
00:33:47,217 --> 00:33:50,011
- [grunts]
- [laughter]

703
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:52,305
It's not my fault
I think that's attractive.

704
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:56,142
You see it on lingerie ads in magazines.
The women are on the bed, bra strap.

705
00:33:56,226 --> 00:33:59,395
Men love vulnerability
and that's what that represents.

706
00:33:59,479 --> 00:34:02,482
"Not me, I like a strong woman."
Bullshit. Vulnerability.

707
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:06,111
"Help me. Open this jar. Please help me."
They love it.

708
00:34:06,194 --> 00:34:08,655
[laughter and applause]

709
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:12,117
What does the bra strap down represent?

710
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,204
You're not supported. When your tits are
flopping around, you can't run away. Yeah!

711
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,540
[laughter]

712
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,835
I want that.

713
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,088
I want that bone structure, right?
I wanna have those shoulders.

714
00:34:25,171 --> 00:34:29,091
I wanna look like the girl on the cover
of the playbill for <i>Les Mis. </i>Just...

715
00:34:29,174 --> 00:34:31,885
[laughter]

716
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,846
"Oh, <i>monsieur!"</i>

717
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,472
[laughter]

718
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:38,517
It's a ten-year-old French girl.
Still, I want those bones.

719
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,601
[laughter]

720
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:44,273
They do, men love vulnerability, right?
That's why the thin thing is the thing.

721
00:34:44,356 --> 00:34:46,233
That's why women are expected to be...

722
00:34:46,316 --> 00:34:50,362
You can't have a baby if you're this big.
That's why we have to be... garden party.

723
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:52,281
Like that kind of thin.

724
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:54,908
Because if women are thin,
there's no nutrition,

725
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:58,829
so you're cold, you don't leave the house,
you don't vote. Yeah!

726
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:01,456
[laughter]

727
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,961
[cheering and applause]

728
00:35:06,044 --> 00:35:08,547
That's why every model
has that vulnerable look.

729
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:13,010
That's why models look like you uncovered
a refugee from under a manhole cover.

730
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:15,637
"Ohhh! Gucci."

731
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:18,556
[laughter and applause]

732
00:35:19,473 --> 00:35:22,977
They love vulnerability. And we do things
to make ourselves vulnerable.

733
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,521
Strong women are told
to tone it down, right?

734
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:28,858
But men are told to toughen up.
We don't let men be vulnerable.

735
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:29,859
That's not fair.

736
00:35:29,942 --> 00:35:33,237
But I can't help you because I'm a girl
and I can only fight one fight at a time.

737
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:35,573
[laughter]

738
00:35:35,656 --> 00:35:38,159
If you wanna come to my green room
and cry after, I will...

739
00:35:38,242 --> 00:35:39,744
laugh at you. But, no...

740
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:40,828
[laughter]

741
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:43,164
But we tell strong women
to bring it down, right?

742
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:47,877
High heels? Why do you wear high heels?
So you what? Can't run from your attacker.

743
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,003
Good.

744
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,338
[laughter]

745
00:35:50,421 --> 00:35:51,589
Smoky eye makeup?

746
00:35:51,672 --> 00:35:53,433
Why does that make sense?
What are you doing?

747
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:56,636
You take the makeup, grind it
into your eye. Why is that attractive?

748
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,306
I figured it out. Smoky eye makeup
makes you look like you what?

749
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:04,101
Just choked on a dick and cried. Good.

750
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:06,229
[laughter]

751
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:07,520
[cheering and applause]

752
00:36:07,604 --> 00:36:10,273
I am not wrong.
It's a little off-brand for me.

753
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:11,274
I am not wrong.

754
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:13,985
[laughter]

755
00:36:14,736 --> 00:36:16,905
It's not enough to be thin ever!

756
00:36:17,656 --> 00:36:20,283
You gotta be gaunt
to the point of extinction.

757
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,411
The kind of thin where it's like,
"What up, bitches? Find me."

758
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:24,788
That kind of thin.

759
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:26,206
[laughter]

760
00:36:27,123 --> 00:36:29,584
Maybe I'm being unfair.
Maybe it's a cultural thing.

761
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:32,629
I can only truly speak
from the perspective of what I am.

762
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,674
I'm an upper-middle-class white woman.
Hope I die that way.

763
00:36:35,757 --> 00:36:36,591
[laughter]

764
00:36:36,675 --> 00:36:40,804
And the expectation of being thin
has been put on us for about 100 years.

765
00:36:40,887 --> 00:36:44,391
That's been the look. The like...
"Uhh, come, have some tea.

766
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:47,310
Yes, these jeans are high.
That's not weird."

767
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:50,105
We like that look.
And that's a hard look to achieve.

768
00:36:50,188 --> 00:36:52,565
Some women die trying to be thin.

769
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:54,192
And it was only in the last...

770
00:36:54,276 --> 00:36:55,652
forty years

771
00:36:55,735 --> 00:37:00,239
that women of color and women
of other ethnicities rose to prominence

772
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:03,701
and made it socially acceptable,
nay attractive,

773
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:05,869
to have the body of a grown woman.

774
00:37:05,953 --> 00:37:07,663
Jennifer Lopez came out of nowhere

775
00:37:07,746 --> 00:37:10,040
with the backside
of a brontosaurus, like...

776
00:37:10,124 --> 00:37:11,959
[laughter]

777
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:13,460
[cheering and applause]

778
00:37:13,544 --> 00:37:14,586
<i>"Qu pas?"</i>

779
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,797
<i>[applause]</i>

780
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,632
And it became attractive.

781
00:37:18,716 --> 00:37:22,803
And somewhere, with everybody having
an agenda in our social conversation,

782
00:37:22,886 --> 00:37:25,556
it became okay to tell white girls
to their faces,

783
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:27,266
"You're fat. Kill yourself."

784
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,101
Bullying us on Facebook.

785
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:30,894
Because you're white,
so life must be easy.

786
00:37:30,978 --> 00:37:33,731
Which, I'm not gonna lie, it's great.
Being white is great. But...

787
00:37:33,814 --> 00:37:34,898
[laughter]

788
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:38,360
It became okay to say that
because we are not spicy, right?

789
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:41,905
White women don't have a fire in them.
There's not a chili pepper here.

790
00:37:41,989 --> 00:37:44,908
Inside here is a scoop
of Breyer's vanilla bean ice cream.

791
00:37:44,992 --> 00:37:46,910
[laughter]

792
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:51,372
And we'll take it.
Your boyfriend tells you you're fat,

793
00:37:51,456 --> 00:37:54,459
we'll be like, "I'm sorry, Chad,
please don't get out of the kayak."

794
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:57,253
[laughter]

795
00:37:57,337 --> 00:37:59,839
"We're gonna have an afternoon.
I brought Jenga."

796
00:37:59,922 --> 00:38:02,050
[laughter]

797
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:05,803
You know who has an unshakeable sense
of self-esteem? Black women.

798
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:06,888
[cheering]

799
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:08,389
You... Yes!

800
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:12,685
You cannot tell a sister on her something
isn't working. She won't believe it.

801
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:13,978
[laughter]

802
00:38:14,062 --> 00:38:16,606
Try it. Say to a black girl,
"I don't like those jeans."

803
00:38:16,689 --> 00:38:18,733
First of all, I dare you.

804
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,651
[laughter]

805
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:24,697
[cheering and applause]

806
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:28,451
It will not rattle her for a second.
Be like, "I don't like those jeans."

807
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:30,870
She'll be like,
"Bullshit. I see you looking."

808
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:32,872
[laughter]

809
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:35,833
[cheering and applause]

810
00:38:36,834 --> 00:38:41,129
Girls, if you want respect,
you're gonna have to take it.

811
00:38:41,213 --> 00:38:42,547
It's 2016.

812
00:38:43,006 --> 00:38:46,510
Let's learn math, let's learn science,
let's drop the body issues, okay?

813
00:38:46,593 --> 00:38:50,430
Don't let anybody make you feel less than.
Your bodies are perfect as they are.

814
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:53,892
[cheering and applause]

815
00:38:53,975 --> 00:38:56,186
And if you want respect,

816
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:59,398
you have to command respect,
not demand it.

817
00:38:59,689 --> 00:39:00,899
Two totally different things.

818
00:39:00,982 --> 00:39:02,943
Commanding respect is in the actions,

819
00:39:03,026 --> 00:39:05,153
it's the way
that we speak about each other,

820
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:07,322
it's the way that you speak
about yourself.

821
00:39:07,406 --> 00:39:09,783
If your whole agenda is to be sexual,

822
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:12,077
and confusing being sexual
with empowerment,

823
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,371
and talking about fucking and sex
all the time,

824
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:18,333
thinking that that's the reason that women
are empowered, you're fucking wrong.

825
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:20,252
It comes with the way you treat yourself.

826
00:39:20,335 --> 00:39:21,837
Don't call each other whores.

827
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,089
Don't call each other sluts.

828
00:39:24,172 --> 00:39:26,216
[cheering and applause]

829
00:39:27,175 --> 00:39:30,094
Because when you do that,
society looks at you and they say,

830
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:32,138
"Oh, it's okay to talk to women that way."

831
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:34,014
You teach people how to treat you.

832
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:35,975
Let's get rid of the phrase
"walk of shame."

833
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:38,310
What is that one? What is walk of shame?

834
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,523
I don't understand that.
I've never had a walk of shame.

835
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:44,817
What could that be?

836
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,903
Walk of shame.
What's there to be shameful about?

837
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:53,242
What's the shame in the fact that he and I
went out, we had the same amount of vodka,

838
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:55,369
he got too drunk to get it up,
so he passed out,

839
00:39:55,453 --> 00:39:59,039
then I used his credit card to buy $100
worth of Chinese and stole his golf clubs?

840
00:39:59,123 --> 00:40:02,126
[cheering and applause]

841
00:40:02,209 --> 00:40:04,211
Walk of shame!

842
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:07,381
[applause]

843
00:40:09,258 --> 00:40:12,470
We're starting from behind here, girls,
we've gotta say smarter things.

844
00:40:12,553 --> 00:40:14,555
From now on... Let's make a pact.

845
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:16,557
From now on,

846
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:20,102
I don't wanna hear any more women

847
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:24,606
talk about how they wanna be... mermaids.

848
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:25,982
[laughter]

849
00:40:26,065 --> 00:40:27,442
Okay?

850
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:29,694
- [cheering and applause]
- Okay?

851
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,530
It's stupid.

852
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,327
And I'm not trying to be a bitch, but
it's probably not gonna happen for you.

853
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,453
[laughter]

854
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,913
Okay?

855
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:42,540
Literally,
you don't have the bone structure.

856
00:40:42,624 --> 00:40:43,708
[laughter]

857
00:40:43,791 --> 00:40:45,710
What worries me, I see it a lot

858
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:47,795
and it's not from children,
it's grown women,

859
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:51,382
like, "I don't wanna be adult any more.
I wanna be a mermaid."

860
00:40:51,466 --> 00:40:55,595
You... The amount of escapism
that's in that sentence!

861
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:58,515
You wanna move to the woods,
you wanna make jam, fine.

862
00:40:58,598 --> 00:41:01,100
At least you're still paying taxes.
You wanna be a mermaid?

863
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:04,103
That means all of your achievements
in life are gonna lead to you being

864
00:41:04,187 --> 00:41:07,398
a fictional fuck toy for a horny sailor.
That's what you want?

865
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:10,860
That's what mermaids are! Read a book!

866
00:41:10,944 --> 00:41:13,237
[cheering and applause]

867
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,988
Because I see it a lot.

868
00:41:15,072 --> 00:41:17,824
T-shirts, right? "I am a mermaid."

869
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:20,452
<i>"Yo soy mermaid."</i>

870
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:21,662
[laughter]

871
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,622
<i>"Je suis mermaid."</i>

872
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:25,249
[laughter]

873
00:41:25,832 --> 00:41:27,543
Let's discuss the logistics...

874
00:41:28,627 --> 00:41:30,504
of being a mermaid,

875
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:32,798
so that you have the information.

876
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:36,385
If and when
the job opportunity presents itself

877
00:41:36,468 --> 00:41:38,095
on Linkedln...

878
00:41:38,178 --> 00:41:39,846
[laughter]

879
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,016
you can make an informed decision,
okay?

880
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,228
If you are a mermaid, you don't sleep.

881
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:48,279
Girls are like, "Oh, my God,
I love sleeping."

882
00:41:48,355 --> 00:41:49,982
"None for you. Just swim."

883
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:51,567
[laughter]

884
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,402
It's chugging Mountain Dew Code Red.

885
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:55,946
There are no beds,
but there is Mountain Dew Code Red.

886
00:41:56,029 --> 00:41:59,491
You're some white-trash jacked-up mermaid
just swimming, swimming.

887
00:41:59,575 --> 00:42:02,201
And by the way, you don't have fins.
Remember, you're half-human.

888
00:42:02,285 --> 00:42:05,705
So you've got arms. You've got
these thick-ass traps, just swimming.

889
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:07,873
[pants heavily]

890
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:10,126
You can't stop swimming,
because if you do,

891
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:13,296
something will try to eat you,
fuck you or kill you, okay?

892
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:16,382
It's not dissimilar to being a woman
in a downtown area.

893
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:18,968
So just swimming, swimming.

894
00:42:19,051 --> 00:42:22,305
Now, you're swimming all day,
you're probably pretty hungry, right?

895
00:42:22,388 --> 00:42:25,308
How are you gonna catch food?
Remember, you're half-human.

896
00:42:25,391 --> 00:42:27,727
We don't have
animal-catching accoutrements,

897
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,647
like claws and tentacles and lasers.

898
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:33,441
We don't have those kind of things.

899
00:42:33,524 --> 00:42:36,777
We have big brains.
So I don't know what you're gonna do.

900
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:38,821
Maybe talk a crab to death.

901
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:41,115
Like, "Excuse me. Excuse me."

902
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:42,992
[laughter]

903
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:47,622
I was thinking of double majoring in
psychology and communications. Excuse me.

904
00:42:47,705 --> 00:42:49,874
Excuse me. Are you a cancer?"

905
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:53,877
So now... you're hungry, you're tired,

906
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,713
you're like, "I don't care
because I'm gonna lay on the beach

907
00:42:56,796 --> 00:42:57,631
like a mermaid."

908
00:42:57,714 --> 00:42:59,924
No, you won't.
Sailors are gonna try to fuck you

909
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:03,428
and the Japanese will definitely
try to eat you just for funsies, okay?

910
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:05,430
[laughter]

911
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:10,769
You're swimming around like, "I don't care
because I'll have long, flowing hair."

912
00:43:10,852 --> 00:43:13,063
No, you won't. You ever go in the ocean?

913
00:43:13,146 --> 00:43:15,231
You guys aren't on an ocean,
you're on a lake.

914
00:43:15,315 --> 00:43:18,401
You're a lake mermaid?
What are you, half trout? Kill yourself.

915
00:43:18,485 --> 00:43:21,154
[laughter and applause]

916
00:43:21,237 --> 00:43:24,699
Ohh! Freshwater mermaid?

917
00:43:26,034 --> 00:43:28,787
[laughter]

918
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:35,627
What if you got, like, the weird end of
the genetic pool and you were half turtle?

919
00:43:36,169 --> 00:43:37,796
No tail but just half...

920
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:41,800
"Long flowing mermaid hair."
You're not gonna have that.

921
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:44,134
You ever go in the water
when there's waves?

922
00:43:44,218 --> 00:43:45,761
You won't have long flowing hair.

923
00:43:45,844 --> 00:43:49,139
You're going to have one giant mer-dread.

924
00:43:49,223 --> 00:43:50,933
[laughter]

925
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:53,894
And it's just gonna follow you.
It's just one big old mer-lock

926
00:43:53,977 --> 00:43:58,315
and it's getting caught on propellers,
it's getting caught on anchors.

927
00:43:58,399 --> 00:44:00,526
There's sea lice living in your mer-dread

928
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:02,903
because that's a warm,
hospitable environment.

929
00:44:02,986 --> 00:44:05,114
Then there's fish
feeding off those sea lice.

930
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:09,034
There's an entire sustainable maritime
ecosystem attached to your fucking head.

931
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:12,079
You drag it around.
Sea lice are nipping at your scalp.

932
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:15,165
You gotta get rid of it, right?
You're like, "I'll just cut it off."

933
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:17,251
Ain't no scissors in the ocean, all right?

934
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:19,628
I don't care
what the Little Mermaid told us

935
00:44:19,712 --> 00:44:22,756
because she was a liar and a hoarder.

936
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,925
[laughter and applause]

937
00:44:25,008 --> 00:44:26,343
Hoarder!

938
00:44:26,969 --> 00:44:30,180
We let it go because she was pretty,
but she was super-gross.

939
00:44:30,264 --> 00:44:31,390
[laughter]

940
00:44:31,473 --> 00:44:34,017
<i># Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? #</i>

941
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:36,227
That's a used toothbrush.
Don't put it in your...

942
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,813
[screams] Ohh! Ohh!

943
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:41,065
[gags] Ohh!

944
00:44:41,149 --> 00:44:42,650
You're gonna get sick!

945
00:44:42,734 --> 00:44:43,734
[laughter]

946
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:47,363
Still gotta get rid of that mer-dread
because it's a hazard, so what do you do?

947
00:44:47,447 --> 00:44:49,088
You have to get another fish to help you.

948
00:44:49,157 --> 00:44:52,285
You have to do what they do
in the animal kingdom. You must what?

949
00:44:52,368 --> 00:44:55,830
You must what? Who here took
marine biology? You have to what?

950
00:44:55,913 --> 00:45:00,418
Form a symbiotic relationship
with other marine life.

951
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:03,171
- Good. And have that fish...
- [laughter]

952
00:45:03,254 --> 00:45:07,216
come in with his fish tooth
and just saw off your mer-dread, right?

953
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,928
It's gonna be bad-looking. But now,
remember, you gotta pay that fish back.

954
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:14,098
That's the nature of a symbiotic
relationship, you must reciprocate.

955
00:45:14,182 --> 00:45:17,602
How you gonna pay that fish back?
You ain't got no money, shell-tits.

956
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:20,021
[laughter]

957
00:45:20,938 --> 00:45:23,524
I hate to say it,
but the only thing you have...

958
00:45:23,608 --> 00:45:24,817
is fish sex

959
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:27,277
and I don't know if you have a vagina

960
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,073
because I'm not an ichthyologist
and I don't know how fish work.

961
00:45:32,157 --> 00:45:35,869
I should've looked it up before the taping
but I'm just trying to tell you some jokes

962
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:39,247
and I think I've done a pretty good job.
You know what fish do? They poop.

963
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:41,082
You've got a fish butt.
So think about that.

964
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,627
- So.
- [laughter]

965
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:46,588
So now you're swimming around,
you're hungry, you're tired,

966
00:45:46,671 --> 00:45:49,716
you've got a fucked-up haircut,
you're like a little sore, you're like...

967
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:51,009
[groans]

968
00:45:51,092 --> 00:45:53,678
"I don't care.
I'm gonna be a mermaid. I'm gonna swim.

969
00:45:53,762 --> 00:45:55,722
Because I will swim like a mermaid."

970
00:45:55,805 --> 00:46:00,685
Let's remember how mermaids allegedly,
because they are not real, swim.

971
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:03,855
They swim... like dolphins.

972
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:04,773
[laughter]

973
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:07,859
Hey, ladies,
do you love ab day at the gym?

974
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:09,903
Well, that's your fucking life, sister!

975
00:46:09,986 --> 00:46:11,571
[laughter]

976
00:46:11,655 --> 00:46:14,616
"37. 38." Just trying to get through.

977
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:18,077
Your entire existence
is that of an R. Kelly backup dancer.

978
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,954
[laughter]

979
00:46:20,037 --> 00:46:22,206
Just swimming through the nineties.

980
00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:24,124
[applause]

981
00:46:24,208 --> 00:46:25,751
So, you can be a mermaid

982
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:29,088
or you can always get a job
in front of a used car dealership.

983
00:46:29,171 --> 00:46:32,174
[laughter]

984
00:46:32,258 --> 00:46:36,845
[cheering and applause]

985
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:42,226
No mermaids.
We can do better. No mermaids.

986
00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:45,813
I worry for women. I worry for men.
I worry for our country.

987
00:46:45,896 --> 00:46:48,732
Is anybody else
really worried for our country?

988
00:46:48,816 --> 00:46:51,527
[cheering and applause]

989
00:46:52,778 --> 00:46:57,157
So I'm worried... And by the way,
I am very proud to be an American

990
00:46:57,241 --> 00:47:00,202
and I love my country very much
and I want the best for it.

991
00:47:00,286 --> 00:47:03,330
There's no joke, it's just a statement.
I love being an American.

992
00:47:03,414 --> 00:47:04,999
[cheering]

993
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:06,916
What I'm scared for...

994
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:10,587
What I'm scared about
aren't so much the nightmares

995
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,549
clawing at our front and back doors,
both politically, foreign, domestic,

996
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,384
economical, ecological, whatever.

997
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,970
What I'm scared about
is the fact that, like,

998
00:47:19,053 --> 00:47:22,223
my generation
is supposed to be grown-up and mature now.

999
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,644
I represent the millennials.
Perhaps you've seen our Instagram pages.

1000
00:47:26,728 --> 00:47:28,021
[laughter and cheering]

1001
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:30,440
Yeah, we cheer for ourselves.
We're the worst.

1002
00:47:30,523 --> 00:47:33,151
[laughter]

1003
00:47:33,234 --> 00:47:36,362
I will say this as the Lorax
of my generation, mustache,

1004
00:47:36,446 --> 00:47:40,116
we... didn't ask to be spoiled.

1005
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,577
Our parents loved us
and they gave us everything.

1006
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,704
That's the job of the generation prior,

1007
00:47:44,787 --> 00:47:47,624
to give the next generation
a better world than they had.

1008
00:47:47,707 --> 00:47:52,337
So I'm gonna apologize to my grandkids for
the radioactive ball of foil and Diet Coke

1009
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:55,423
that they're gonna inherit from us.

1010
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:58,258
But that's what the people before you do.

1011
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:01,970
And I believe that this wave of
entitlement started with our grandparents.

1012
00:48:02,054 --> 00:48:04,431
Our grandparents were called
the greatest generation,

1013
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:05,849
and I believe that they were.

1014
00:48:05,932 --> 00:48:08,477
They selflessly gave
and they made this country

1015
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,021
the idea of America that a lot of us miss.

1016
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:13,899
White people. The rest of us,
it was horrible for most of them.

1017
00:48:13,982 --> 00:48:15,317
- But in general...
- [laughter]

1018
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,069
The main points of it, okay?

1019
00:48:17,152 --> 00:48:19,863
Your grandparents had to fight.
They had no choice.

1020
00:48:19,946 --> 00:48:22,491
Grandpa had to fight in World War II.

1021
00:48:22,574 --> 00:48:25,952
Grandpa was straight-up drizafted, okay?
He had no choice.

1022
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,205
And when he came home from the war,

1023
00:48:28,288 --> 00:48:31,541
all he wanted to do was have a family,
have a job, be a little racist

1024
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:34,211
- and live the American dream, that's it.
- [laughter]

1025
00:48:34,294 --> 00:48:37,673
He fought, he got right to work.
It's not like guys today who'd be like,

1026
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:41,093
"Oh, I just wanna backpack around Oregon
and find myself." No!

1027
00:48:41,176 --> 00:48:42,719
[laughter]

1028
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:46,306
And they're allowed to say that
because, whether you like them or not,

1029
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,518
our military does such a good job
of defending us on a day-to-day basis.

1030
00:48:50,601 --> 00:48:53,104
[cheering and applause]

1031
00:48:53,187 --> 00:48:56,357
And I know that TSA blows.

1032
00:48:57,775 --> 00:49:01,153
But they do such a good job
that you're allowed to mentally check out.

1033
00:49:01,237 --> 00:49:03,864
Like, if you don't like
the war going on right now,

1034
00:49:04,281 --> 00:49:05,741
unlike it on Facebook.

1035
00:49:05,825 --> 00:49:06,992
[laughter]

1036
00:49:07,076 --> 00:49:08,619
You're allowed to do that.

1037
00:49:08,703 --> 00:49:11,080
There was no concerted effort.
You didn't have to fight.

1038
00:49:11,163 --> 00:49:14,417
My point is, there was no day
we all gathered in our town squares

1039
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,337
and threw our iPhones into the center
so the military could use the scrap metal.

1040
00:49:18,421 --> 00:49:21,132
"What's this? A droid? Take it back,
freak." We didn't have that.

1041
00:49:21,215 --> 00:49:22,842
[laughter]

1042
00:49:22,925 --> 00:49:27,012
I think it's difficult to conceive of a
world where you have to sacrifice so much

1043
00:49:27,096 --> 00:49:30,266
and to understand what our grandparents
did because now they're old,

1044
00:49:30,766 --> 00:49:34,186
and when you think old, what do you think?
Cute, right?

1045
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,731
Your grandparents are cute because
they're tiny, shrinking.

1046
00:49:36,814 --> 00:49:37,935
Pick them up, put them down,

1047
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:40,650
they don't like it, sprinkle water,
"Get it off me."

1048
00:49:40,734 --> 00:49:41,568
[laughter]

1049
00:49:41,651 --> 00:49:44,571
And the whiter you are,
the greater a chance there is

1050
00:49:44,654 --> 00:49:49,242
that you've developed some weird
prerogative kitten-like nickname

1051
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:51,202
for your grandfather.

1052
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:55,206
Oh, it's not Grandpa anymore,
it's like, "This is my Nim-Nam."

1053
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,168
[laughter]

1054
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:00,754
"This is my Yippers."

1055
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:03,381
"This is my Pip-Pop."

1056
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:07,093
Pip-Pop doesn't give a fuck. He's like,
"I was a prisoner of war for six years,

1057
00:50:07,177 --> 00:50:09,471
call my Pip-Pop, I've had worse."

1058
00:50:09,554 --> 00:50:11,848
[laughter]

1059
00:50:13,308 --> 00:50:15,685
"Oh, my God, you guys,
my Pip-Pop is so cute.

1060
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:17,812
Oh, my God, Pip-Pop,
he's so cute, you guys.

1061
00:50:17,896 --> 00:50:21,316
Sometimes at Christmas,
when Pip-Pop falls asleep,

1062
00:50:21,399 --> 00:50:23,651
we like to decorate him
with Christmas bows.

1063
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:25,779
Isn't that funny? Silly Pip-Pop."

1064
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:28,156
Pip-Pop's got 53 confirmed kills!

1065
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:30,282
[laughter]

1066
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:34,161
[cheering and applause]

1067
00:50:38,874 --> 00:50:40,834
Don't think for a second

1068
00:50:40,918 --> 00:50:44,838
Pip-Pop doesn't remember how to repurpose
that Christmas bow around your neck

1069
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:47,049
to get the intel that he needs out of you.

1070
00:50:47,132 --> 00:50:50,093
"Sit the fuck down,
Colton, Caleb, Ashton, Crashton, Crandon,

1071
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:52,346
whatever your fucking hipster name is,
sit down!"

1072
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:54,181
[laughter and cheering]

1073
00:50:54,264 --> 00:50:57,810
Pip-Pop came home from the war
and then they had our parents.

1074
00:50:57,893 --> 00:51:03,023
Our parents are called the baby boomers
because Pip-Pop came home from Normandy

1075
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:07,986
and he was like, [gasps] "I'm not dead.
Boom, Gladys, let's fuck."

1076
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,613
And then...

1077
00:51:09,696 --> 00:51:12,574
[laughter and applause]

1078
00:51:12,658 --> 00:51:14,910
The baby boomers, ask your parents,

1079
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:18,539
were the first generation that were
allowed to be artists on a mass scale.

1080
00:51:18,622 --> 00:51:21,874
You didn't have to work on your
family business, you could take drugs,

1081
00:51:21,958 --> 00:51:25,378
rock 'n' roll, you could do and be
what you wanted to be in the big city.

1082
00:51:25,461 --> 00:51:27,380
The baby boomers had generation X.

1083
00:51:27,463 --> 00:51:29,423
I don't care about them
because I'm a millennial.

1084
00:51:29,507 --> 00:51:33,511
We showed up, got a trophy for breathing
and then we invented Instagram.

1085
00:51:33,594 --> 00:51:37,265
[cheering and applause]

1086
00:51:39,058 --> 00:51:41,102
What's insane about Instagram is this.

1087
00:51:41,185 --> 00:51:46,107
We use hashtags, right?
Hashtag, formerly known as the pound sign.

1088
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,441
[laughter]

1089
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:48,901
She got a makeover.

1090
00:51:48,985 --> 00:51:52,488
What's weird about a hashtag... is this.

1091
00:51:52,572 --> 00:51:57,034
The more hashtags there are
under a posted picture on Instagram,

1092
00:51:57,118 --> 00:52:01,414
the less likely the last hashtag
is gonna have anything to do...

1093
00:52:01,497 --> 00:52:02,498
[laughter]

1094
00:52:02,582 --> 00:52:04,333
with that posted picture.

1095
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:07,169
You got more than four hashtags
under your picture,

1096
00:52:07,253 --> 00:52:10,381
you are witnessing
a human thought process devolve.

1097
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:11,882
[laughter]

1098
00:52:11,965 --> 00:52:15,677
By the end, it's just word association.
Free word association.

1099
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,638
Bunch of people on the beach,
Fourth of July, right?

1100
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,224
"Fuck, yeah! #FourthBitches

1101
00:52:21,308 --> 00:52:23,685
# Fourth #BeachDay #BDay

1102
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:26,730
# IndependenceDay #IndependentWoman
#Beyonce" Yes!

1103
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:30,233
"#Blessed #IPayMyBills
#BikiniBody #BeachBody

1104
00:52:30,317 --> 00:52:33,278
# BoutThatLife #DontNeedAMan
#DontWantAMan #NeverHadAMan

1105
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:36,239
# SometimesToFeelAHumanEmotion
ILikeToDrinkMyOwnHair"

1106
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:38,158
What? What? What?

1107
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:39,659
[cheering and applause]

1108
00:52:39,743 --> 00:52:40,743
Say something.

1109
00:52:42,495 --> 00:52:44,164
Talking about?

1110
00:52:46,791 --> 00:52:48,877
And then, because we're so hard on women,

1111
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,255
we're mean to women when they're proud
of their bodies on Instagram.

1112
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:55,926
We only allow women to post pictures
when they're a work in progress, right?

1113
00:52:56,009 --> 00:52:57,761
"Keep it going." If you're ever like,

1114
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:59,971
"This is as good as it gets,
fucking check it out!"

1115
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:02,556
it's like,
"You whore. You showy fucking bitch."

1116
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:06,644
So instead of empowering women
and letting them be proud of themselves,

1117
00:53:06,727 --> 00:53:10,522
women have to shroud their pride
in misdirect hashtags.

1118
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:14,485
So you've got a generation of girls proud
of their bodies in a bathroom like this,

1119
00:53:14,568 --> 00:53:18,280
and rather than be like,
"#CheckOutMyBodylmSoHappyWithMyself,"

1120
00:53:18,364 --> 00:53:21,867
instead she's like,
"#CheckOutTheGroutWorkOnTheseTiles."

1121
00:53:21,951 --> 00:53:23,285
[laughter]

1122
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:24,995
Who's looking at that?

1123
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:29,208
I broke up with my boyfriend
a couple of months ago.

1124
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:34,171
Let me ask you a question. Have you ever
dated someone who is... so pretty...

1125
00:53:35,756 --> 00:53:37,424
but so stupid?

1126
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:40,636
[laughter and cheering]

1127
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:42,721
Notice, it's girls cheering.

1128
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:46,100
All the guys are like, "Yeah,
I brought her here. Keep it moving!"

1129
00:53:46,183 --> 00:53:48,227
[laughter]

1130
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,104
"I don't wanna get in a fight!"

1131
00:53:52,313 --> 00:53:55,984
So, men can do that. Women really can't.

1132
00:53:57,026 --> 00:54:00,613
And the reasoning isn't because men
are dicks, there's nothing like that,

1133
00:54:00,697 --> 00:54:02,865
it has to do
with the wiring of our brains.

1134
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:07,495
Men are visually stimulated, women,
unfortunately, are cerebrally stimulated.

1135
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,957
Men are visual creatures.
They have to be attracted to a woman

1136
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,502
before they can get to know how amazing
she is inside. They have to be...

1137
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:18,297
A dude will date a popsicle stick if
it's got a wig. Like, it doesn't matter.

1138
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,799
[laughter]

1139
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,969
That's why it's tough,
because you wanna be a feminist,

1140
00:54:23,052 --> 00:54:24,773
like, "I don't have to get ready
for a man,"

1141
00:54:24,846 --> 00:54:27,432
but that's what they're attracted to.
Just the littlest bit.

1142
00:54:27,515 --> 00:54:30,643
Everybody's got that one girlfriend that's
like, "I don't get it. I volunteer

1143
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:34,063
and I rescue animals and I'm very sweet."
It's like, "Yeah, but you're so ugly

1144
00:54:34,147 --> 00:54:37,150
so you have to... Just brush the hair!

1145
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:40,028
Just, anything! One tooth."

1146
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:42,488
[laughter]

1147
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:44,197
You don't have to have it out there.

1148
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:47,284
He cannot check out your personality
from across the room.

1149
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,368
That's all I'm saying.

1150
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:49,953
No man has ever done that.

1151
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,206
No man has ever seen a woman
who's sitting there nibbling on her nubs

1152
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,709
- with, like, a gill...
- [laughter]

1153
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:59,212
and walked up and been like, "Excuse me,
you're hideous, but you look like

1154
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,341
you might enjoy Tom Clancy,
light nipple play and barbecue.

1155
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:03,258
Is that true?"

1156
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:04,926
[laughter]

1157
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,305
[applause]

1158
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,810
And women do stuff to make themselves
physically attractive.

1159
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:15,729
Even if you're not trying that hard,

1160
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,190
most of the stuff we do
is just to get men's attention.

1161
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,026
Shiny hair. Why is your hair shiny?
It makes you look fertile.

1162
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,985
Thanks, Pantene.

1163
00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:25,614
But that's why. There's no reason to have
it shiny other than to get attention.

1164
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,658
You're not, like, deflecting a car light
when you're running.

1165
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,621
Big eyes. "Look at me! My lips look like
a vagina and my boobs look like a butt

1166
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:35,956
and my butt looks like boobs.
I'm a Mrs. Potato Head. Mate with me!"

1167
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,958
[laughter]

1168
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,379
- You may not like it, but I'm not wrong.
- [laughter]

1169
00:55:41,462 --> 00:55:43,672
Women are cerebrally stimulated.

1170
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:47,927
That's why we say the number one thing
we look for in a man is a conversation.

1171
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,222
"Someone I can talk to. Sense of humor."

1172
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:55,684
I have dated gutter goblins who were just,
like, really funny and smart.

1173
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:58,104
"I just wanna talk to him. It's sexy.

1174
00:55:58,187 --> 00:56:01,232
I just want someone I can talk to.
At. Just sit there and breathe, Steve."

1175
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:04,819
We need that back and forth.
We have to be able to talk.

1176
00:56:04,902 --> 00:56:08,322
And it's something that we need,
and yet we're chastised for it.

1177
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,741
You ever been called a "chatty Cathy"?

1178
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:13,244
By an idiot, but still,
ever been called that?

1179
00:56:13,786 --> 00:56:17,289
"A couple of girls just yipping away, huh?
She'll talk your ear off.

1180
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:20,334
Bunch of giblets in a henhouse."
No-one says giblets in a hen...

1181
00:56:20,417 --> 00:56:22,461
That means the chicken's already dead.

1182
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,130
[laughter]

1183
00:56:24,213 --> 00:56:27,257
Women are always chastised
for talking a lot.

1184
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,260
The reason women talk
goes back thousands of years.

1185
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:34,013
The reason women talk a lot,
have a proclivity for speaking... Mm!

1186
00:56:34,097 --> 00:56:38,309
Is when men would go out and hunt
and fight and get animals,

1187
00:56:38,393 --> 00:56:40,770
- otherwise known as hunting...
- [laughter]

1188
00:56:40,854 --> 00:56:44,023
"Go get an animal."
Women stayed behind...

1189
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:45,775
[laughter]

1190
00:56:45,859 --> 00:56:48,778
And we raised the kids
and we made food.

1191
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:51,197
And because the world
wasn't really a thing yet,

1192
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:53,491
we exchanged survival secrets.

1193
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:56,494
We would tell each other things like,
"Oh, don't eat that berry,

1194
00:56:56,578 --> 00:56:59,122
it'll make your husband's dick fall off."

1195
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:00,790
"Don't wipe with that leaf,

1196
00:57:00,874 --> 00:57:03,918
I found in my studies
that it really hurts your vagina."

1197
00:57:04,002 --> 00:57:07,463
You had to exchange this information
to keep your tribe alive.

1198
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:09,924
Now, that's devolved to,
"What color lip gloss?"

1199
00:57:10,008 --> 00:57:13,887
but it's the exchange of information.
Girls gather and then share.

1200
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,847
So guys,
when we're talking and it bothers you,

1201
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,850
just know we're trying to make it
so your dick doesn't fall off!

1202
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:21,351
That's what we're doing.

1203
00:57:21,435 --> 00:57:23,353
Trying to help you!

1204
00:57:23,437 --> 00:57:26,023
- Trying to help you live!
- [cheering and applause]

1205
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:33,739
Nothing wrong with it. I'll say it.
I'm a feminist. You know what?

1206
00:57:33,822 --> 00:57:36,366
I'll say it for the women
that don't know to say it.

1207
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,452
And you might not be comfortable with it.

1208
00:57:38,535 --> 00:57:42,080
Because a lot of women are like, "I love
being a woman, but I'm not a feminist."

1209
00:57:42,164 --> 00:57:44,917
What are you, a horse?
Like, what are the other options?

1210
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:47,336
Let me clarify it...

1211
00:57:47,419 --> 00:57:48,545
[cheering]

1212
00:57:49,129 --> 00:57:51,507
for the men and the women
who might not have a clear idea.

1213
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,259
Being a feminist means
you just wanna be treated fairly,

1214
00:57:54,343 --> 00:57:57,471
you just want it even, no more, no less.
Maybe like a little bit more.

1215
00:57:57,554 --> 00:57:58,722
You just wanna get the same.

1216
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:01,844
And a lot of women
don't like to say they're feminists

1217
00:58:01,892 --> 00:58:04,520
because they don't think
it sounds attractive, right?

1218
00:58:04,603 --> 00:58:06,896
Which is inherently an issue
in and of itself.

1219
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:09,649
Because men think feminist,
they have a bad idea of it.

1220
00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:13,444
Guys think of some square-jawed broad
with three chin hairs and a power suit,

1221
00:58:13,528 --> 00:58:15,780
like, "I'm gonna kick you in the dick
and take your job!"

1222
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,406
That's not what we want.

1223
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:19,367
We just want it even.

1224
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:22,328
If we're gonna be feminists,
let's start with something fun.

1225
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:23,996
Wage gap, gotta close that.

1226
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,833
But let's start with something everybody
wants to deal with. Yeah, for sure. Duh!

1227
00:58:27,917 --> 00:58:28,751
[cheering]

1228
00:58:28,834 --> 00:58:30,628
Let's start with porn.

1229
00:58:30,711 --> 00:58:33,798
[cheering]

1230
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:36,842
Because even if you're a woman
and you love being a porn star,

1231
00:58:36,926 --> 00:58:39,679
it's still you taking it
for, like, three hours,

1232
00:58:39,762 --> 00:58:42,765
you're getting paid 30 percent less
and he's actually getting off,

1233
00:58:42,848 --> 00:58:45,434
so let's make some feminist porn.

1234
00:58:45,518 --> 00:58:48,187
Let's see a porn
where a girl kicks a door in, like...

1235
00:58:48,729 --> 00:58:51,607
"Who wants to lick it? Line up! Go!"

1236
00:58:51,691 --> 00:58:53,693
[laughter and cheering]

1237
00:58:53,776 --> 00:58:54,944
Go!

1238
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,153
Next! Go!

1239
00:58:58,363 --> 00:59:00,282
Beat your best time. Go!"

1240
00:59:00,365 --> 00:59:03,118
[laughter]

1241
00:59:03,201 --> 00:59:05,870
- That's so gross.
- [laughter]

1242
00:59:05,954 --> 00:59:07,497
So off-brand. So gross.

1243
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:11,251
Now, all the girls are cheering,
because in theory, that's empowering.

1244
00:59:11,334 --> 00:59:13,211
But in practice, horrific.

1245
00:59:13,295 --> 00:59:16,339
That would be horrible.
No woman could withstand that.

1246
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:19,759
Halfway through the second guy, we'd
all be like, "Okay, okay, okay, okay!"

1247
00:59:19,843 --> 00:59:20,843
[laughter]

1248
00:59:20,885 --> 00:59:22,721
"It's sensitive! I need a minute!"

1249
00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:25,181
[laughter and applause]

1250
00:59:25,265 --> 00:59:27,392
"I just need a minute!
I just need a minute.

1251
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:30,061
Don't hug me.
I'm not mad, I just need a minute."

1252
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:31,563
[laughter]

1253
00:59:31,646 --> 00:59:34,941
"Why don't you go order us a pizza?
I'll fire up my Pinterest page."

1254
00:59:35,025 --> 00:59:37,485
[laughter and cheering]

1255
00:59:39,237 --> 00:59:41,865
Let me ask you a question.
This is for the girls in the audience.

1256
00:59:41,948 --> 00:59:44,242
This is a very real question,
very real statement.

1257
00:59:44,326 --> 00:59:45,869
Have you ever been...

1258
00:59:45,952 --> 00:59:48,704
Have you ever been
having sex with your boyfriend

1259
00:59:48,787 --> 00:59:52,082
and you're not into it, like, obviously,
and then all of a sudden,

1260
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:54,168
you start to get really excited?

1261
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:56,837
Not so much from physical stimulation,

1262
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,839
but because mentally you're like...

1263
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:03,427
"This is almost done."

1264
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,013
[cheering and applause]

1265
01:00:09,725 --> 01:00:11,935
[laughter]

1266
01:00:12,019 --> 01:00:13,937
And when it is done... [gasps]

1267
01:00:14,021 --> 01:00:18,025
we shall go to the farmers market!"

1268
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,235
You plan out the whole day.

1269
01:00:22,363 --> 01:00:24,907
Guys, you have to make sure
her head is in the game,

1270
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,951
no pun intended,
but, like, pun intended for sure.

1271
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:31,872
I don't think we check in with each other
enough as opposite sexes.

1272
01:00:31,955 --> 01:00:35,876
Men think because she's making noises
they hear in movies, she's enjoying it.

1273
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:39,170
Women are like, "I'm making noises,
let's fucking get it over with."

1274
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:43,257
If you care about the girl, you gotta
make sure she's getting what she wants.

1275
01:00:43,341 --> 01:00:46,511
And girls, the best thing you can do,
if you have great sex,

1276
01:00:46,594 --> 01:00:49,263
the best thing you can do
the second sex is over

1277
01:00:49,347 --> 01:00:52,058
is... not talk to him.

1278
01:00:52,141 --> 01:00:53,434
[laughter]

1279
01:00:53,518 --> 01:00:55,853
Sounds horrible.
It's actually to your benefit.

1280
01:00:56,479 --> 01:00:59,440
That's not your boyfriend
lying next to you.

1281
01:00:59,524 --> 01:01:02,402
That is a husk of a man...

1282
01:01:02,485 --> 01:01:03,611
[laughter]

1283
01:01:03,695 --> 01:01:05,863
- depleted of all bodily fluids...
- [laughter]

1284
01:01:06,739 --> 01:01:10,910
incapable of giving you
the answer you deserve.

1285
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:14,205
And I get it. You just had sex,
you're feeling great, oxytocin is flowing,

1286
01:01:14,288 --> 01:01:16,874
you just hosted a human being
inside of you...

1287
01:01:17,583 --> 01:01:20,086
You love him
and you wanna talk about the future.

1288
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:21,754
He can't do it.

1289
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,800
You look at him and say, "What are you
thinking about?" He's laying there, dust.

1290
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:28,969
[exhales heavily]

1291
01:01:29,052 --> 01:01:30,679
[laughter and applause]

1292
01:01:30,762 --> 01:01:32,681
"Ohh."

1293
01:01:32,764 --> 01:01:35,225
Get him a Gatorade, give him five.

1294
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:39,229
He can't answer you. You'll be like,
"What are you thinking about?"

1295
01:01:39,312 --> 01:01:43,817
He'll never, ever be like,
"You in a wedding dress."

1296
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,027
[laughter]

1297
01:01:48,155 --> 01:01:52,325
But guys, if you love your girl, check in
with her. Because you're far away.

1298
01:01:52,409 --> 01:01:54,202
She's up there. You're here like,

1299
01:01:54,286 --> 01:01:56,955
"I'm amazing.
I'll bet she fucking loves this."

1300
01:01:57,038 --> 01:02:00,834
And we're down there like,
"I wonder if lavender is in season."

1301
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:03,503
[laughter]

1302
01:02:03,587 --> 01:02:06,381
[applause]

1303
01:02:06,465 --> 01:02:08,049
Still back there.

1304
01:02:08,759 --> 01:02:10,594
"Siri, is lavender..."

1305
01:02:10,677 --> 01:02:13,847
[laughter]

1306
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,557
"Calling Mom Cell."

1307
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,559
- "No, Siri!"
- [laughter]

1308
01:02:17,642 --> 01:02:19,478
"No!" Snap.

1309
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:21,061
[laughter]

1310
01:02:23,647 --> 01:02:26,650
The moral of that story is
I was in a relationship

1311
01:02:26,734 --> 01:02:29,236
and I wasn't happy,
so I left the relationship.

1312
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:31,947
I'm not advocating
for leaving the person you're with.

1313
01:02:32,031 --> 01:02:34,867
What I am advocating for is this.
If you're not happy,

1314
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,953
there's no reason to stay
out of fear of being alone.

1315
01:02:38,537 --> 01:02:40,080
We like to scare women.

1316
01:02:40,164 --> 01:02:43,000
[cheering and applause]

1317
01:02:43,083 --> 01:02:45,252
And I'm sure there are men
that feel this way.

1318
01:02:45,336 --> 01:02:49,256
But we like to scare women when they're
single and we like to be mean to them

1319
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,259
and we label them.
We say mean things to them.

1320
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:54,804
She's a spinster. Old maid.

1321
01:02:54,887 --> 01:02:57,223
Really involved with animal rescue.

1322
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,600
- We have names like that.
- [laughter]

1323
01:02:59,683 --> 01:03:02,353
And we like to question them,
as if there's something wrong.

1324
01:03:02,436 --> 01:03:03,436
"Why are you single?"

1325
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,981
"Because the last one was a dick
and I'm not stupid."

1326
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:07,983
Like, that's why you do it.

1327
01:03:08,067 --> 01:03:09,819
[cheering and applause]

1328
01:03:09,902 --> 01:03:11,778
Nobody wakes up married.

1329
01:03:11,861 --> 01:03:14,155
Nobody is born betrothed to someone.

1330
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:17,200
We have to be kinder to women
and stop doing it.

1331
01:03:17,283 --> 01:03:19,702
And we have the audacity
to have magazines,

1332
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:22,413
self-help books, articles,
posing the question,

1333
01:03:22,497 --> 01:03:25,792
"You're single. Now what?
You're single. Now what?"

1334
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:27,418
What do you mean, "Now what?"

1335
01:03:27,502 --> 01:03:29,546
Now I shave off an eyebrow
and take up with wolves.

1336
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:32,382
What do you mean, "Now what?"
What do you mean, "Now what?"

1337
01:03:32,465 --> 01:03:35,552
I got a mortgage.
How about fuck bitches, get money?

1338
01:03:35,635 --> 01:03:36,469
[cheering]

1339
01:03:36,553 --> 01:03:38,263
It's so stupid.

1340
01:03:38,346 --> 01:03:41,266
[cheering and applause]

1341
01:03:48,314 --> 01:03:52,235
What upsets me is that women
spend so much time and energy

1342
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,864
flogging themselves mentally
for being single,

1343
01:03:55,947 --> 01:03:59,117
and changing and trying different methods
and looking for guys.

1344
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,952
And men don't have to do that.
They have the luxury of relaxing

1345
01:04:02,035 --> 01:04:06,164
because they don't have eggs.
There are no articles in GQ like,

1346
01:04:06,248 --> 01:04:08,834
"You're single. Now what?"
There's none of that.

1347
01:04:09,543 --> 01:04:12,921
The answer would always be, "Now I can
jerk off where I want. No-one bugs me.

1348
01:04:13,005 --> 01:04:14,423
# Sandwich."

1349
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:17,718
[laughter and applause]

1350
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:24,099
The good part about traveling for
the last year, I've had time for myself.

1351
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:25,309
[laughter]

1352
01:04:25,392 --> 01:04:27,144
More time from my research.

1353
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,355
- I don't do research.
- [laughter]

1354
01:04:30,439 --> 01:04:32,441
- I just watch TV.
- [laughter]

1355
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:35,736
But I wear a lab coat while I do it
for the tax write-off.

1356
01:04:35,819 --> 01:04:37,529
[laughter]

1357
01:04:38,322 --> 01:04:41,658
Before we get out of here,
before we conclude this <i>TED Talk...</i>

1358
01:04:41,742 --> 01:04:44,244
[laughter]

1359
01:04:44,328 --> 01:04:46,747
Does everybody here watch <i>Shark Tank?</i>

1360
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,917
[cheering and applause]

1361
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,376
So...

1362
01:04:53,336 --> 01:04:55,922
All I want, all I want,

1363
01:04:56,005 --> 01:04:58,507
is a live episode of <i>Shark Tank.</i>

1364
01:04:58,591 --> 01:05:01,218
That's what I want. A live episode.

1365
01:05:01,302 --> 01:05:02,887
It's a reality show.

1366
01:05:02,970 --> 01:05:06,432
But if you watch it, you'll notice
it's heavily edited, heavily produced,

1367
01:05:06,515 --> 01:05:08,142
and what bothers me...

1368
01:05:08,935 --> 01:05:12,063
is the presentations from
the entrepreneurs are too polished.

1369
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:15,900
There's no grit to them. They come out
like a fifth-grade Thanksgiving pageant.

1370
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:17,818
"The natives called it maize.
We bottled it."

1371
01:05:17,902 --> 01:05:19,820
I don't wanna see that, okay?

1372
01:05:20,404 --> 01:05:21,864
I want to see you mess up.

1373
01:05:21,948 --> 01:05:24,367
I wanna see you trip.
Maybe you forget your words.

1374
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:29,622
Maybe you chip a tooth. I wanna see you
crumble as an entity before my eyes.

1375
01:05:29,705 --> 01:05:34,669
Only then will I tolerate you rising
from the ashes with any degree of hubris.

1376
01:05:34,752 --> 01:05:37,380
That's the way to consume
American reality TV.

1377
01:05:37,463 --> 01:05:41,008
The sheer <i>schadenfreude </i>of watching
someone shit themselves on TV

1378
01:05:41,092 --> 01:05:44,469
and then building them back up.
That's what we like to see. Okay?

1379
01:05:44,552 --> 01:05:47,138
[cheering and applause]

1380
01:05:47,222 --> 01:05:50,600
These are cattle farmers
from the middle of Iowa

1381
01:05:50,684 --> 01:05:54,145
and they get in front of a camera
and suddenly they're Winston Churchill?

1382
01:05:54,229 --> 01:05:56,189
I don't buy it, okay?

1383
01:05:56,272 --> 01:05:58,900
I speak for a living and even I mess up,

1384
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:02,070
so there's no way
these two fucking dye jobs from ASU

1385
01:06:02,153 --> 01:06:04,531
with, like, a new take on cookies,
there's no way!

1386
01:06:04,614 --> 01:06:05,657
[laughter]

1387
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:07,659
Flawlessly orating.

1388
01:06:07,742 --> 01:06:12,122
There are three archetypes of women
that they like to have on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

1389
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:15,625
They love to have moms,
because most of us have moms.

1390
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:18,378
[laughter]

1391
01:06:20,255 --> 01:06:22,590
But what's crazy and, like, creepy

1392
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:25,301
is that all the moms on <i>Shark Tank</i>

1393
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:27,637
have the exact same voice.

1394
01:06:27,721 --> 01:06:28,638
[laughter]

1395
01:06:28,722 --> 01:06:30,390
It's a little Stepfordian.

1396
01:06:30,473 --> 01:06:32,976
They all sound like this.

1397
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:35,853
[in perky voice] "Hi, Sharks.
My name's Nancy from Laguna Niguel

1398
01:06:35,936 --> 01:06:39,523
and I've discovered a new way to get
your toddler to eat their blueberries."

1399
01:06:39,606 --> 01:06:40,774
[jabbers]

1400
01:06:40,858 --> 01:06:44,111
[laughter and cheering]

1401
01:06:44,194 --> 01:06:47,072
[cheering and applause]

1402
01:06:47,156 --> 01:06:51,076
Then they have really smart women.
They do. They'll have brilliant women.

1403
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:54,413
But it seems that the smarter the woman,
the longer the last name.

1404
01:06:54,496 --> 01:06:56,540
Like, they'll hyphenate their last names.

1405
01:06:56,623 --> 01:06:58,500
I can't stand hyphenated last names.

1406
01:06:58,584 --> 01:07:01,962
If you're in this room and you've got
a hyphenated last name, chop it in half!

1407
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:03,047
[laughter]

1408
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,632
Okay? You're not Spanish royalty. Chop it!

1409
01:07:05,716 --> 01:07:06,717
[laughter]

1410
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:08,802
I barely care about your first name.

1411
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:10,471
[laughter]

1412
01:07:10,554 --> 01:07:12,931
Let alone
the entire questionable heritage.

1413
01:07:13,015 --> 01:07:15,476
When you have a hyphenated last name,

1414
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:18,896
all that makes me think is that
mama was a big old strong lesbian

1415
01:07:18,979 --> 01:07:21,065
and she didn't wanna
give up her family inheritance

1416
01:07:21,148 --> 01:07:24,609
so she begrudgingly married your father,
now they have separate twin beds

1417
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:27,528
and are co-women's studies professors
at Wellesley.

1418
01:07:27,612 --> 01:07:30,364
[laughter and applause]

1419
01:07:30,448 --> 01:07:32,366
It's also just so much information.

1420
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:35,912
I'm trying to hear you,
your valuation, listen to the equity,

1421
01:07:35,995 --> 01:07:38,539
and you're coming up there
with a phonebook, like, "Hi, Sharks.

1422
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:41,084
My name's
Michelle-Lida-Julia Freeman-Cereal."

1423
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:43,377
"And I'm Rebecca-Lynn-Stacey
Fitzgerald-Yang.

1424
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:45,755
And together, we sound like five dudes."

1425
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,050
Like, it's a lot... of information.

1426
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:52,095
Are you inventors or a law firm?
Like, what is that?

1427
01:07:52,178 --> 01:07:53,513
[laughter]

1428
01:07:53,888 --> 01:07:55,556
And then in the final category,

1429
01:07:56,015 --> 01:07:58,309
the toy category, we have the hot women.

1430
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:01,646
Not attractive. Not cute.

1431
01:08:01,729 --> 01:08:04,732
Fucking hot. Teeth, tan, tits, hair.
"Sharks!"

1432
01:08:04,816 --> 01:08:07,151
[laughter]

1433
01:08:07,235 --> 01:08:10,363
Sometimes they do this.
They'll have very smart woman on the show.

1434
01:08:10,446 --> 01:08:15,242
Sometimes it feels like the hotter
the woman, the dumber the product.

1435
01:08:15,325 --> 01:08:17,786
And I believe it's done
to keep us in line.

1436
01:08:17,869 --> 01:08:22,499
But... a lot of the time, the women's
products have to do with two categories.

1437
01:08:22,582 --> 01:08:24,918
It's either wrangling your femininity.

1438
01:08:25,544 --> 01:08:28,797
"Sharks, it's a flap you put
over your vagina

1439
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,215
so no one knows you have one."

1440
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:33,927
[laughter]

1441
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,179
"Move through the workplace with ease."

1442
01:08:36,263 --> 01:08:37,430
[laughter]

1443
01:08:37,514 --> 01:08:42,018
Or it's a product so stupid,
it will just confirm

1444
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:45,772
any preconceived notions you might have
about female intelligence.

1445
01:08:45,856 --> 01:08:50,026
Like, "Sharks, it's a shower cap
that you can wear while you're cooking

1446
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:52,154
so your hair doesn't smell!"

1447
01:08:52,237 --> 01:08:53,905
[imitates gun firing] No!

1448
01:08:53,989 --> 01:08:56,032
[laughter]

1449
01:08:56,116 --> 01:08:59,786
[applause]

1450
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:03,039
You just set us back, like, a week
with that shit, Lexi.

1451
01:09:03,123 --> 01:09:04,499
[laughter]

1452
01:09:04,583 --> 01:09:06,625
But that's the one
that I'd like to see live.

1453
01:09:07,126 --> 01:09:08,419
The hot one.

1454
01:09:08,794 --> 01:09:11,630
Because I believe
watching an attractive woman

1455
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,382
mentally unravel...

1456
01:09:13,465 --> 01:09:14,300
[laughter]

1457
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:18,762
on national television
is the reason we all watch reality TV.

1458
01:09:18,846 --> 01:09:20,347
[laughter]

1459
01:09:20,431 --> 01:09:23,517
"Up next are two sisters
from Scottsdale, Arizona,

1460
01:09:23,601 --> 01:09:26,270
with a new take on popcorn."

1461
01:09:26,353 --> 01:09:28,939
[sings Shark Tank music]

1462
01:09:29,023 --> 01:09:31,525

1466
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:45,289
"Hi, Sharks! My name's Madison."

1467
01:09:45,372 --> 01:09:47,708
Duh. They're always named Madison, right?

1468
01:09:47,791 --> 01:09:50,085
"And this is my sister, Michaela."

1469
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:52,421
They're always named Michaela.
Fucking obviously.

1470
01:09:52,504 --> 01:09:56,716
"And together,
we are the inventors, creators

Oh, my fucking goodness!
We haven't done the product yet.

We can't. We can't start over.

I will do it. Just stay there.

It's fine. Stay there. I will handle it.
Stay there, you fucking casualty.

Okay, the other day,

my sister and I were at home
eating popcorn and crying,

1494

and we got down to the bottom of the bag.

And, shake, shake, shake,
what was left at the bottom?

All the unpopped kernels.

decided that we should...

No, this is not about me!

I am trying to help!
This is nothing like when Daddy died!

She does this! She does this every time!

Everybody's gonna know
that you're a fucking...

1511
01:11:49,785 --> 01:11:53,331
I wasn't flirting with your husband!
You are so fucking insecure!

1512
01:11:53,414 --> 01:11:55,458
Because I slept with your boyfriend
in high school

1513
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,001
and he turned out to be gay!

1514

No, it wasn't your fault!
Big fucking deal!

1515
01:11:59,253 --> 01:12:01,047
He wanted to talk about your birthday

1516
01:12:01,130 --> 01:12:04,550
so that fucking Michaela could turn 40
for the third time!

You're a fucking bitch! I need a minute!

I need a fucking minute! I need...

I need a Madison minute! Hold on!

I'm fucking good!

the walls bleeding? I can't do this.

01:12:28,615 --> 01:12:32,118
Oh, good news. It's not shit. It's blood!
It's blood, you fucking monster!

1527
01:12:32,202 --> 01:12:35,872
I am trying... I can't... No.
You know what? I am keeping it together.

1528
01:12:35,955 --> 01:12:39,000
I am the stable one!
I am keeping it... I am not...

1529
01:12:39,084 --> 01:12:41,669
I am not yelling!
I am not yelling. I am not yelling.

1530
01:12:41,753 --> 01:12:44,798
Huh? What? Yes, it's a hive.
This happens.

1531
01:12:45,632 --> 01:12:48,718
It happens every time you open
your fucking whore mouth! Yes, I know!

1532
01:12:48,802 --> 01:12:50,637
And I'm trying...

1533
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,306
I'm a good feminist.
I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry.

1534
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:54,432
I'm sorry!

1535
01:12:54,516 --> 01:12:56,851
I'm sorry! My tan is dripping off.

1536
01:12:56,935 --> 01:12:58,436
I am not..."

I am not... [exhales]
I am not yelling. I am not yelling!

She's ruining it!
She's ruining everything!"

We put everything...
We put everything into this company!"

Everybody depends on me

1559
01:13:52,656 --> 01:13:56,869
because we spent all of our money
on our first company and it shat the bed."

the fucking psycho bitch that you are.
Everyone's gonna know. I'm gonna...

01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:11,841
I'm gonna tell the cameras.
Is this camera still on? Good."

Um... Fuck, it's, like,
stuck right here in my nose."

[sniffs and gasps]

- [laughter]
- "Uhh!

1573
01:14:36,949 --> 01:14:40,786
Do you remember when, um,
our country went through a recession,

1574
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:45,041
and everybody was losing their homes
and their money?

1575
01:14:45,124 --> 01:14:48,628
My sister and I decided that rather
than save up or go back to school,

1576
01:14:48,711 --> 01:14:51,839
we would do what every other girl
without a marketable skill did,

1577
01:14:51,923 --> 01:14:55,760
we... opened up a cupcake company."

[laughter]

1579
01:14:58,596 --> 01:15:02,015
[cheering and applause]

1580
01:15:03,683 --> 01:15:06,728
"I don't know if you noticed,
but during the recession,

1581
01:15:06,811 --> 01:15:09,814
there was a fucking boom
in the confection industry!

1582
01:15:09,898 --> 01:15:13,026
That's because it doesn't take
a fucking rocket science degree

1583
01:15:13,109 --> 01:15:15,111
to shit out, like, an okay cupcake.

1584
01:15:15,195 --> 01:15:17,614
And, like,
no one's gonna say no to a cupcake.

1585
01:15:17,697 --> 01:15:20,617
People will spend their last dollar.
They're not gonna be like, "No,"

1586
01:15:20,700 --> 01:15:23,328
they'll be like,
"A cupcake. My day's okay for a minute."

1587
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:25,539
And we were feeding people these cupcakes

1588
01:15:25,622 --> 01:15:27,999
and they were upside-down on their houses

1589
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:31,253
and they were jobless and we were feeding
these depressed people cupcakes.

1590
01:15:31,336 --> 01:15:33,964
And it's a scientific fact
that obesity and depression

1591
01:15:34,047 --> 01:15:37,300
have a direct correlation, and we were
just feeding the belly of the beast

1592
01:15:37,384 --> 01:15:40,262
from within the belly of the beast
and capitalizing off of it.

1593
01:15:40,345 --> 01:15:43,890
People needed answers.
They needed a viable option for credit,

1594
01:15:43,974 --> 01:15:48,019
not a buttercream... Put your fucking back
against mine! I swear to Christ, Michaela,

1595
01:15:48,103 --> 01:15:50,355
if you ruin this for me,
I will fuck your husband!

1596
01:15:50,438 --> 01:15:53,065
Screw it! Cut!
I should've been a mermaid!"

1597
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:58,070
[cheering and applause]

1598
01:16:08,247 --> 01:16:11,208
[dance music]
