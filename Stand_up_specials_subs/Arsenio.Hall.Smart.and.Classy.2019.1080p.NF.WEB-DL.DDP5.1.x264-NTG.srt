1
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,893
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Arsenio Hall.</i>

2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,362
What's up?

3
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,372
-Oh, yeah.

4
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,331
Hey.

5
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,960
Oh, shit.

6
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,256
I've been coming to San Jose
for a long time.

7
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,924
This is such a wonderful night.

8
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,760
I first came to San Jose

9
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,553
opening for The Spinners.

10
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,726
Yeah. Way back when y'all wasn't as nice
to a motherfucker as you are tonight.

11
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,519
- You know?

12
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,396
Yeah, I opened for The Spinners.

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,441
I-- It was when you would see
"The Mighty Spinners" on the marquee,

14
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,984
and under it, "Arsenio Hall,"

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,737
and you thought that's where
the fucking show was gonna be at.

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,030
-You know?

17
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,992
I was at a restaurant--
I walked in a restaurant recently

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:19,245
and there's a couple sitting
in the front booth, lady and a man.

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,082
And the lady looks at me
and smiles, you know?

20
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,001
And she has that knowing look
and I'm like, "Yeah."

21
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,839
I gave her some Arsenio shit
and I did that to her, you know.

22
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:34,511
As I walked away,
I heard her say to her husband,

23
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,888
"Honey, it was the guy from <i>Blade."</i>

24
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,723
- I was like...

25
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,731
You bitch, you...

26
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,651
-Poke your fucking eyes out of there.

27
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,821
-"Stop it, Wesley! Stop!"

28
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,283
Yeah.

29
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:00,954
That's God's way
of putting the Hollywood ego in check.

30
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,748
That's happened to me before.

31
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,501
I was-- I was walking at Universal City,

32
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,838
and there's a family of four
coming towards me.

33
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,342
And they were all happy
and looking for a Sharpie in Mommy's purse

34
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,469
'cause they thought
they saw Wesley Snipes.

35
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,181
And I knew they didn't know
who the fuck I was. I knew it!

36
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,016
You know, the kid--
The kids was doing this...

37
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,145
-I knew they didn't know who I was.

38
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,566
And my job is making people happy.
Making people smile.

39
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,734
And I'm thinking I won't even tell 'em

40
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,695
-who the fuck I am, you know?

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,905
Just let 'em think
they had a brush with greatness.

42
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,699
Let 'em think they've met Wesley.

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,744
Why not?

44
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:42,829
-Fuck it.

45
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,874
As they got closer,

46
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,209
I said, "I'm going to act
just like Wesley."

47
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,880
-I kicked the boy in the throat.

48
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,215
The little boy, I caught the little boy.
He was like, eight.

49
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,758
I fucked that little boy up.

50
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,178
Caught him right on the Adam's apple.

51
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,890
Now he has a memory
from when he met Wesley.

52
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,811
He talked like Miles Davis
 the rest of his fucking life.

53
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,899
"Wesley Snipes kicked me
in the throat.

54
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,776
-Motherfucker said, 'Always bet on black.'

55
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,906
I don't fucking get it."

56
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,909
Right as I was walking away,

57
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,952
-they said, "Can we get autographs?"
- Yeah!

58
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,038
Yeah,  and I'm thinking like
that's forgery.

59
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,207
-That's forgery, you know.

60
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,583
I know the law.

61
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:32,045
But they were smiling.
They were so happy, so I'm like,

62
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,087
"Fuck it."

63
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,300
I know what my job is.
I'm gonna make 'em happy.

64
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,260
I'm gonna write the shit
Wesley would write.

65
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,639
-So I wrote, "Fuck the IRS.

66
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,182
-Love, Wesley."

67
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,393
Yeah.

68
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,773
Yeah.

69
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,652
"Uncle Sam, suck my <i>To Wong Foo.</i>
Love, Wesley."

70
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,987
-I got creative with the shit.

71
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,242
"The Asian vagina is the tightest vagina
on the planet. Love, Wesley."

72
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,955
Oh!

73
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,457
I was in Alabama.

74
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:14,754
Arrived at the airport in Alabama,
got out of a SUV at curbside.

75
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,465
This is a crazy one,
I'm still in therapy over this one.

76
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,384
-This is crazy.

77
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,760
I step out of the car.

78
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,305
There's a man and his son,
and the son's holding a basketball.

79
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,935
And the man steps to me, swear to God,
man steps to me and said,

80
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,937
"Excuse me, Mr. Rodman?"

81
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,606
-And I'm like, "Oh, shit!

82
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,111
-Motherfucker, no, you did not.

83
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,698
You did not just mix me up
with fucking Dennis Rodman.

84
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,325
-No, you didn't. No, you did not."

85
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,370
Yo, I know white people have that
"All black people look alike" thing,

86
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,080
but stop it, y'all! Stop it.

87
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,001
Dear white people, you gotta start
looking at details and shit.

88
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,046
We do not all look alike.

89
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,091
And if we do,
it's us and that nigga over there.

90
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,010
-Dennis, he's not with us.

91
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,720
It's us, we all look alike.

92
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,223
Yo.

93
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,808
That fucked me up.

94
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,268
He was sincere.

95
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,854
He wasn't snapping, he was sincere.

96
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,482
And I'm like, "Look at details,
motherfucker. Look at details.

97
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,944
I ain't got no tattoos,
I ain't got no nose ring.

98
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,154
I ain't got no hepatitis,

99
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,989
- I don't understand.

100
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,616
-What have you seen?"

101
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,663
Oh, shit.

102
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,167
I will kick your son
in the throat, mister.

103
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,758
I know I'm not Denzel,

104
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,885
but Dennis, nigga? Dennis?

105
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,058
- Oh my God.

106
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,684
Fuck.

107
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,772
And you know,
I think what it is,

108
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,648
is when I see Dennis on TV,

109
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,860
he's always like crying or some shit,
you know, in the news.

110
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,321
And everybody look ugly crying.

111
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:07,241
-And Dennis is always crying in a clip.

112
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,284
Remember?

113
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,412
He brought Trump and Kim Jong-un together.

114
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,416
And I think that nigga thought he was
gonna get a Nobel Peace Prize 'cause he...

115
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,753
"My friend..."

116
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,547
He was so emotional,
he couldn't even say Kim Jong-un's name.

117
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,549
That motherfucker said,
"Kim Yum-Yum."

118
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,968
-I'm like, "Kim Yum-Yum?

119
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,265
If that's your friend,
you should learn his name."

120
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,434
-Kim Yum-Yum?

121
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,896
Kim Yum-Yum is a stripper
I met in Orlando.

122
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:37,980
-Shit.

123
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,607
Kim Yum-Yum is...

124
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,568
somebody Robert Kraft hooked me up with.

125
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,112
-I got a good massage

126
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,571
and happy ending and shit.

127
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,992
Kim Yum-Yum a bad bitch,
but I think he meant Kim Jong-un.

128
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,328
Oh my God.

129
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:55,456
- "Kim Yum-Yum..."

130
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,377
Kim Jong-un.

131
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,588
I can't stand
that little fat motherfucker.

132
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,799
Fat-ass.

133
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,136
-Bad haircut-having motherfucker.

134
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,556
Testing missiles?
Test a new barber, bitch.

135
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,224
-How about--

136
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,017
You know, your fade is fucked up.

137
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,269
-You need--

138
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:21,649
You need to ask Trump for a barber
from Harlem to straighten out your fade,

139
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,859
fat motherfucker.

140
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,905
He better stop fucking with us,
threatening us.

141
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,032
Ain't nothing he can do with America.

142
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,244
He better make friends
testing his missiles.

143
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,206
And I've seen satellite footage
of his missiles failing.

144
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,083
He don't even know
if that shit will work.

145
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,586
You know?
I've seen that shit just fall over.

146
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,839
Motherfucking missile needs Cialis

147
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,215
-or something, I--

148
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,969
I don't make missiles, but something wrong
with his fucking missiles.

149
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,054
I've seen them fail.

150
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,389
He's like the Wile E. Coyote

151
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,516
-of international leaders and shit.

152
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,104
Motherfucker got missiles
with "Acme" written on 'em.

153
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,860
He be trying to scratch it out with crayon
and write, "Un."

154
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,573
Don't wanna compete with America.

155
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,284
-We're the greatest.

156
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,911
Yeah, we're the greatest.

157
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,664
Maybe-- maybe they can have
a marching contest with us.

158
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,626
North Korean army?
You ever seen them motherfuckers march?

159
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,211
Them's some marching little niggas.

160
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,754
-You ever seen them march?

161
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,964
On the news, if you walk past the TV
you be like,

162
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,925
"Look at them motherfuckers march."

163
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:33,054
They be-- The legs be locked and shit.
Them motherfuckers be bouncing.

164
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,141
Yeah, right?
They be marching they ass off.

165
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,061
And then they got little tricky shit
they do. I saw him salute,

166
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,437
and they like dabbed.

167
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,190
I don't know what dabbing is
in North Korea,

168
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,691
but them motherfuckers was marching,

169
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,109
-they said...

170
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,946
I said... "Look at them niggas march."

171
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:53,074
They like the Alphas
or the Q's or some shit.

172
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,117
Them niggas is stepping.

173
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,829
We can have a marching contest.

174
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,332
We still gonna win 'cause we America.

175
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,168
-I've seen our soldiers march.

176
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,713
And... And we got some shit--

177
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,340
We got some shit for you.

178
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:13,427
We gonna have our soldiers work out
with New Edition before the contest.

179
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,638
-Yeah. Right.

180
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,473
Now they'll turn that shit out. It'd be,

181
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:21,310
<i>♪ If it isn't love,</i>
<i>Why do I feel this... ♪</i>

182
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,688
-We turn that shit out.

183
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,690
We turn that shit out.

184
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,941
-America.

185
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,529
Yes.

186
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,531
Oh, man.

187
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,327
It's a great time to do stand-up
'cause there's so much going on.

188
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,663
At the same time,

189
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,541
it's a scary time to do stand-up.

190
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,378
You think every word
could end your fucking career.

191
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,717
Even Jerry Seinfeld said that shit
is too politically correct.

192
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,718
- Yup.
-You know?

193
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,469
- Yeah!
-And by the way,

194
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,597
I speak for this whole group.

195
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,641
If Jerry Seinfeld offends you, fuck you.

196
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,518
-You know?

197
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:03,936
-I mean...

198
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,355
-Come on.

199
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,482
<i>Jerry</i> offends you?

200
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,610
You a little thin-skinned.

201
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,236
-You a little thin-skinned.

202
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:16,115
You might wanna fucking join ISIS
and get the fuck out of here

203
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,576
-if Jerry offends you, you know?

204
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,662
You should be at the Damascus Improv
this weekend.

205
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,458
Get the fuck outta here

206
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,210
before we build a wall
around your motherfucking ass.

207
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,005
Jerry offends you.

208
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,840
It's hard to do stand-up.

209
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,967
Now you be nervous, you know?

210
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,595
Roseanne had the racist tweet.

211
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,973
Bam! Everything.
They fired her, she's over, and...

212
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,058
And you know what?

213
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,894
I wasn't as mad about the tweet

214
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,230
as I was that she blamed
the racism on Ambien.

215
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,610
I love Ambien.

216
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,447
Yeah, thank you.

217
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,032
I thought it was a melatonin crowd

218
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,909
-for a moment, but uh...

219
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,160
Oh, man.

220
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:05,164
There's a certain time in life where
there's nothing like a good fucking nap.

221
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,540
-You know?

222
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,958
Fucking Ambien nap.

223
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,419
And I was mad, 'cause I was like--
Not at her, but I was like,

224
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,339
"Ooh, I hope that's not true,"
and it turned out it wasn't,

225
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,092
'cause I don't want
Ambien to make you a racist.

226
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,468
-You know?

227
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:21,263
'Cause I wouldn't stop taking it.
I love my Ambien naps.

228
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,434
I would just be a motherfucker
at the mall

229
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,186
talking about,
 "White devils!"

230
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,235
I'm sorry, ma'am.

231
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,152
I'm-- I'm sorry.

232
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,155
-I had an Ambien nap and I...

233
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,575
think I had some kind
of racist Tourette, I think.

234
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,619
My bad.

235
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,081
That would be fucked up if you
didn't know what that was, you know?

236
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,084
Have an Ambien nap
and be walking around saying like,

237
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,002
"White women smell like baloney."

238
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,137
I have racist Tourette, I think.

239
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:05,307
I don't know, I took an Ambien nap.
I need a physical.

240
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,436
You know what's funny
about what I just said?

241
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,605
I'm looking at some of y'all are laughing,
but I see one lady who's like,

242
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,816
"What's that shit
about baloney, motherfucker?"

243
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,569
-She's like, "No, you tried to slide

244
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,904
-that baloney shit.  What--

245
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,991
What'd nigga say about baloney
and white women? What the fuck?"

246
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,785
Oh my God. Oh my God...

247
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,664
Take a half an Ambien, by the way. A half.

248
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,750
Yeah.

249
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,168
No, not a whole one.

250
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,420
Yeah, you'll pee on yourself.

251
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,213
-I took a whole one and--

252
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,342
Yeah, I took a whole one
one time and I thought I was

253
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,888
dreaming about waterfalls
in Hawaii and some shit.

254
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,140
-I just was pissing...

255
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,476
on myself, you know?

256
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,354
I woke up and my room was smelling
like R. Kelly's recording studio and shit.

257
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:58,277
-I was like, "What the fuck?"

258
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,198
Yeah.

259
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,617
It was embarrassing, you know?

260
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,660
I was standing with some sheets.

261
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,412
<i>♪ I believe I can lie ♪</i>

262
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,252
I think people who don't curse...

263
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,339
are living dishonest.

264
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,967
You gotta let that shit out. Be honest.

265
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,303
You ever been walking through your house,

266
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,014
late at night, in the dark,

267
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,058
with no shoes on?

268
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,313
And hit your baby toe
on a piece of furniture?

269
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,315
-Ooh... Yeah, see?

270
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,567
I see the look.
Y'all know what I'm talking about.

271
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,569
That shit hurt.

272
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,697
Yeah. You have--
You can't say "fudge nugget."

273
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,536
-You got to say "shit."

274
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:51,789
I believe the pope would say "shit"
if he hit his toe.

275
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,209
And I love this pope.
This pope would probably say "shit"

276
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,378
and "motherfucker,"
the pope we got right now.

277
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,423
"Shit! Motherfucker!
I gotta get my Birkenstocks.

278
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,259
-I'll be damned."

279
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,679
God puts extra feeling in that baby toe.

280
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,307
And no self-esteem.

281
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:14,520
You ever notice that? I see pretty ladies,
no matter how fine you are,

282
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,772
your baby toe is like this.

283
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,732
-It's depressed and shit.

284
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,317
No fucking self-esteem.

285
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:23,028
The baby toe be leaning on the other toes.

286
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,655
"How y'all doin'? Y'all all right?"

287
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,701
-Little ugly motherfucker, right?

288
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,453
You can feel it in your shoe sometimes,
you know?

289
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,915
The other toes, "Get your black ass
off me, motherfucker! Get off me!

290
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,712
Rotten-ass baby toe looking motherfucker.
Get off me! Just stand up straight."

291
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,473
No matter who you are.

292
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,393
Your baby toe may be prettier than mine,

293
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,563
but it's uglier
than your other four, right?

294
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,400
Sometimes the lady don't know what to do
when you go weekly,

295
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,777
she's just standing there
with an emery board

296
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,614
-and like a tear in her eye.

297
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,573
Right?

298
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,243
She look like the Indian from
the pollution commercial back in the day.

299
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,913
"I don't know what to do
with this ugly motherfucker."

300
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,166
'Cause it won't die, it won't grow,
it look the same every week.

301
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,837
You don't know what color polish
to put on it.

302
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,343
'Cause you put red on the other four toes,
and that one look dark crimson and shit.

303
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,719
-You don't know--

304
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,930
Do I need a white base?
Do I put some pink in it?

305
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,766
How do I make
that little black motherfucker lighter?

306
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,855
And I see pretty ladies laughing.
You know what I'm talking about.

307
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,903
One of the prettiest women in the world
is from my hometown, Halle Berry.

308
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,113
-Agreed? Yes.

309
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,449
-Halle Berry.

310
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,953
I don't care what race you talkin',
what age you talkin',

311
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,246
one of the most beautiful women
in the world.

312
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,248
But I saw her-- Yes.

313
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,917
-I saw her with flip flops on.

314
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,834
This is true.

315
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,544
-Don't let this leave the room.

316
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,923
Saw her with flip flops on,
and I ain't going to go too far into this,

317
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,884
but she's a perfect ten from head...

318
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,177
to ankle.

319
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,598
But that's just between us.

320
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,187
That's just normal.
Everybody. Your baby toe is...

321
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,106
is crazy-looking.

322
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,900
My woman has beautiful feet.

323
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,027
But that baby toe...

324
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:32,616
Her foot, except for the baby toes,
 is perfect.

325
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,578
But the baby toe, it look like she had
a transplant that went wrong or something.

326
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:40,499
Like an episode of <i>Stranger Things,</i>
when you look at her baby toes...

327
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,381
Look like somebody
put Dikembe Mutombo's toe on her foot.

328
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,135
One time I was getting ready
to suck her toes and the baby toe said,

329
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,054
"No, no, no!"
And then I was like, "Oh, shit."

330
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,224
I wish I had that on video.

331
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,065
I was at a comedy club

332
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,943
and the manager of the comedy club

333
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,364
told this young lady when she came off
stage that she was banned from the club

334
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,702
because he told her not to use
the "m-word" again, and she did.

335
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,579
"Midget."

336
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,706
She said "midget" and got banned.

337
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,499
We're so politically correct.

338
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,711
But here's what bothered me. He told her,
"That's just like using the 'n-word,"

339
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,421
and I said,  "Err!"

340
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,216
No, it's not, motherfucker.
I had to get into shit.

341
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,927
I was getting into
somebody else's business, but

342
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,597
no, the m-word and the n-word,

343
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,849
there's nothing like the n-word.

344
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,311
I'm sure midgets have been through
a lot of shit. Don't get me wrong.

345
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,228
-I get it.

346
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,357
But not like niggas.
There's nothing like the n-word.

347
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,861
If you don't want me to say midget,
just tell me don't say midget,

348
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,447
but don't tell me it's like
the fucking n-word. It is not.

349
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,909
You don't see no movies where midgets
are taken from their people

350
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,160
into another country

351
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,995
-and forced to pick cotton.

352
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,163
You've never seen a midget--

353
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,583
<i>-♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪</i>

354
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,796
You've never seen a midget
with Kenny Norton in <i>Mandingo 2.</i>

355
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,590
-Hervé Villechaize and Kenny Norton.

356
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,635
<i>♪ Swing low, sweet chariot ♪</i>

357
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:15,928
Never seen that shit.

358
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,429
So don't, don't do that.

359
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,224
Don't do that with the n-word, you know?

360
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,935
Nobody ever told a midget,
"I'm changing your name."

361
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,145
-Nobody ever did that to a midget.

362
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,271
"What's your name?"

363
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,482
- "Pecari Maximus."

364
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,819
It's like, "From now on, you'll answer
to 'Itty Bitty,' motherfucker.

365
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,364
-Say it! Say, 'Itty Bitty.'"

366
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,698
It's like,

367
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,992
-"My name is Itty Bitty. It's Itty Bitty."

368
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,872
"Hey, Fiddler.

369
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,750
My name is Itty Bitty now.

370
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,213
But it's really Maximus."

371
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,510
Yeah.

372
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:59,596
Nobody ever gets angry at the sight...

373
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,557
of a midget.

374
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,853
Right?
You've never seen a Western bar...

375
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,654
You frontin'.

376
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:21,076
You've never seen a Western bar
where a midget walk in, you know,

377
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,413
and a bunch of rednecks be,
"Look at that fucking midget.

378
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,333
Messing with our women."

379
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,965
And a very sharply dressed midget
is like, "Where the white hoes at?

380
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,552
Hey bitch, come here.
Let me talk to you.

381
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,763
San Jose snow, yeah."

382
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,147
You wouldn't believe
that I'm the son of a Baptist preacher.

383
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,485
Gosh. When I first started stand-up,

384
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,531
my comedy hero
used to always approach me and say,

385
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:04,244
"Look, a smart, classy comic
doesn't have to curse and be dirty."

386
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,955
And I used to say, "Okay, Mr. Cosby."

387
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,791
-I was like...

388
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,843
I love to say "Mr. Cosby"
in an audience of people.

389
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,306
Yeah, that just tears the room in half.

390
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,227
I heard some asses getting tight,
you know.

391
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,938
Right? Over in this area I heard...

392
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,486
'Cause everybody feels different
about that, you know?

393
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,032
Yeah, some of you are like,
"I'm so glad he said that."

394
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,036
And then other people are like,
"You know them 60 bitches lied, right?

395
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,206
They all lied."

396
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,252
There are two sides of the issue, clearly.

397
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,548
I remember seeing a picture
of all the ladies on cable news

398
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:01,593
and I'm like,
"Wow, that's a lot of women."

399
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,347
You know? And I saw people I knew.
That affects you.

400
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,474
I saw actresses I knew and models I knew.

401
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,060
I saw everybody but Oprah and Madea,
it felt like.

402
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,728
-It was very-- It was like...

403
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,440
Madea would have whooped his ass, though.
That would have been a nice...

404
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,695
-a nice UFC fight, Madea and Bill Cosby.

405
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:23,156
- Over a cup of coffee and shit.

406
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,872
Yeah, but that's one of my comedy heroes.

407
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,293
You know what I've had to do?
I've had to separate the artist

408
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,420
from the man, you know.

409
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,715
I mean, the artist has done so much
for the black image on television

410
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:43,176
and he made me laugh as a kid
and he's given so much money

411
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,429
to black colleges.

412
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,472
I've had to separate Dr. Huxtable

413
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,683
-from Dr. Fuxtable is what I'm saying.

414
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,268
-That's what I've had to do.

415
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,938
Everybody has to handle it
in their own way.

416
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,482
-You know?

417
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,238
I saw-- I saw Lady Beverly Johnson,

418
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:06,325
who I know,
a model, and she told her story.

419
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,242
It was interesting.

420
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,037
She said that Bill Cosby
put some shit in her drink,

421
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,747
but it didn't put her to sleep.

422
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,833
She was able to cuss him out
and call a cab.

423
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:19,296
And I was like, "That goes to prove,
once again, you really can't drug

424
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,839
an old school New York model."

425
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:25,093
You really can't. She was like,
"Motherfucker, I take this for fun, Bill.

426
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:27,679
This shit right here?

427
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,307
I went to summer school
at Studio 54, motherfucker.

428
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,353
You can't put me to sleep.
How 'bout if I fuck you, Bill? Come here.

429
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,354
Come here, Bill."

430
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,775
She wasn't going to sleep.

431
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,447
I saw the court trial
where the lady got the guilty verdict.

432
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,741
Her name was Andrea Constand.

433
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,410
And I don't-- Did y'all see her?

434
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,661
Y'all see her in the news?

435
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,830
'Cause initially when she walked in,

436
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:57,501
I saw her walk in, I was like,
"Oh, shit. Why is Colin Kaepernick here?"

437
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:01,129
-I didn't know who that was, you know?

438
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,548
And then I realized that was her.

439
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:08,220
I also realized she don't want no dick.
He's guilty.

440
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,015
She don't want-- You can look at her,
she don't want no dick.

441
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,434
She has never wanted no dick, Bill.

442
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,775
She looked so much like Colin Kaepernick
I figured she, before she fell asleep,

443
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,861
just took a knee and said like,
"Motherfucker."

444
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:33,662
Mm.

445
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,707
Yeah,  see, when you're black,
you have less heroes.

446
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,627
So this stuff is important to you.

447
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,713
You know? That's why a lot of people
can't let it go.

448
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,216
They're still, "I don't know
about that Cosby thing.

449
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,843
There's not enough women yet."

450
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,931
-Tiger Woods.

451
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,766
You know, my favorite golfer.

452
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,813
At one time, the greatest golfer
in the world was a black man.

453
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,066
Don't tell him, though.
Don't say it to him, he gets mad.

454
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,235
-But he is, he's black.

455
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,487
He's black.

456
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,865
Fuck them words he be making up.
He's black.

457
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,786
Tiger Woods, man. He's...

458
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:18,874
I think he's finished. You keep wanting--
Like he did really well a couple weeks ago

459
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:21,293
and you're like,
"Oh, Shaq gave him some Icy Hot."

460
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,086
-And he'd be like, you know...

461
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,173
But it's just a... a good day.

462
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,424
Just one good day.

463
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,010
And the other days he golf
like Charles Barkley.

464
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,888
The other days just like...

465
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,103
- "That was terrible."

466
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,606
- Terrible!
- Terrible!

467
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:50,280
And then the fall
from that infidelity chapter.

468
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,240
Um...

469
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:56,578
I thought he would become a better golfer
after all that stuff

470
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,873
because I'll tell you,
like me, whatever I'm doing in life,

471
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:05,170
if my relationship is right, I'm focused
and I'm better at anything that I'm doing.

472
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:10,300
But apparently Tiger was better
on the 18 holes when he had 18 hoes.

473
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:14,012
Yeah. That motherfucker was good
when he was...

474
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,973
staying out late with waitresses.

475
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:24,105
Yeah. And then the DUI thing happened
with Tiger Woods.

476
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,815
I woke up--

477
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,985
This is how it happened for me.
I woke up, I turn on the TV,

478
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,154
and I'm like, "Oh...

479
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,617
Tiger Woods is in the freeway
with the police

480
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,869
and he ain't got on no fucking shoes."

481
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,706
And he got no shorts and I'm like...

482
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,626
And I heard him babbling about pills.

483
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,672
I call my girl, I said, "Baby.
I think Bill Cosby raped Tiger Woods."

484
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,846
I'm sorry. I was making up fake news.
I was like...

485
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,974
"That's not what happened at all."
You know?

486
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,476
I was tweeting the shit already, you know?

487
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,062
I had to erase all my tweets.

488
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,231
My publicist,
"Are you out of your fucking mind?"

489
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:10,068
"Tiger Woods got Jell-O puddin'
on his back."

490
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:10,986
You know?

491
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,946
-And I'm like tweeting this shit out.

492
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,614
It's like, "Motherfucker,

493
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,242
that's the reflection
of the police light."

494
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,705
That's not Jell-O pudding.
That was... Delete, delete.

495
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,708
I was making up fake news.

496
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,255
I was recently in Washington.

497
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,799
There was a protest.

498
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:35,802
Interesting protest against...

499
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,056
I guess you would call it white privilege.

500
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,603
I don't understand
why the owner of the Redskins

501
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,481
won't tell Native Americans,
"Fine. I'll change the name."

502
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,401
I mean, there's so many animals
we don't use.

503
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,319
The lemming.

504
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,362
-They could be the Washington Lemmings.

505
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,740
You know, everyone follows
the fucking lemmings.

506
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,199
You know?

507
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,619
-We don't-- You know what I'm saying?

508
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:07,167
It's 'cause-- they were protesting
because they don't like that Redskin icon

509
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,045
that you have on the helmet,
a smiling ass Indian.

510
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,671
You know, this is a people.

511
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,922
This is not an icon.

512
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,799
-This is our native people.

513
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,884
You know what I'm saying?

514
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,344
-It's like--

515
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:18,845
Here's the thing.

516
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,264
Sometimes you've got to put yourself
in a situation,

517
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,683
and that's how I thought about it.
Like if there was a team--

518
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:29,147
If I came up here and y'all had a new team
called the San Jose Light Skin Negroes

519
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,732
-or some shit like that...

520
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:32,776
You know?

521
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,905
And y'all had fucking helmets
with Drake on the side,

522
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:41,493
I'd be like, "I'm staying till Monday
to march on you motherfuckers.

523
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,577
I'm marching."

524
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,164
Y'all can't put Drake on a fucking helmet.

525
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,209
-I'm staying to march on this bitch.

526
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,798
Yeah, I worked...

527
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,802
in D.C. and then to, uh...

528
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,637
I went to see the monuments.

529
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,640
There were monuments I'd never
seen before, like the MLK monument.

530
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:07,018
And it's funny, all the monuments
have these incredible things you can read.

531
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,479
There's quotes.
And we'll probably live long enough--

532
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:14,651
One day, there's gonna be, like,
a Donald Trump monument in Washington.

533
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,486
-'Cause he's our president. Yes.

534
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,113
I know y'all may not like it,

535
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,657
but it's gonna be a little orange monument

536
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,033
-with tiny ass hands

537
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:24,661
and shit or something. I don't know,
they can get creative with it.

538
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,997
And they're gonna have to put something--

539
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,917
They're gonna have to put
"Grab them by the pussy" in granite.

540
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,922
Right?  I mean,
that's his greatest quote so far.

541
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,842
"Grab them by the pussy."

542
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,762
The monument
you have to rush your kids by.

543
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:44,806
It's like, "Come on,
let's look at the Reagan one.

544
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,890
Don't read that.

545
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,518
-Bring the kids. Bring the kids."

546
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:59,112
It's interesting that no rapper
ever wrote a song

547
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,157
after that incident called
"Grab Them By The Pussy."

548
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,580
Usually hip-hop imitates life,
but even the rappers were like,

549
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,999
"No, we don't talk about women like that,
motherfucker.

550
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,169
-That's rude.

551
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,463
Uh-uh.
You don't grab nobody by their pussy."

552
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:24,387
We are a generation of parents
that have to teach our kids,

553
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,097
"Don't you talk like the president.

554
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,477
I done told you,
I don't mind you talkin' like Future,

555
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,854
-but don't you talk like the president."

556
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,276
Oh, man.

557
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,780
-Kanye should have done a song.

558
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:44,157
'Cause Kanye like him and shit, you know?

559
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:48,244
They could do the video in the Oval Office
where we last saw them hanging out.

560
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,417
A Kanye track called
"Grab Them By The Pussy" might work, too.

561
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,714
<i>♪ Grab them by the pussy,</i>
<i>The pussy, the pussy, the pussy ♪</i>

562

<i>The pussy, the pussy ♪</i>

564
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,351
-Kanye could turn that shit out.

565
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,896
Be number one
on the Breitbart chart.

566
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,319
Throw some bars in there.

567
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,904
Get Trump to sit at his desk.

568
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,239
You know.

569
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,866

00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,174
-Yeah, that shit work, right?

575
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:44,926
For Kanye.

576
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,930
When I first met Donald Trump,
I thought we'd get along.

577
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:55,353
'Cause rappers used to talk about him
and he was liked a lot more then.

578
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,815
I thought, you know,
we had stuff in common.

579
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,693
We both like baseball,
we both like politics.

580
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,194
We both really like his daughter.

581
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,154
-And--

582
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,949
I thought it might work out,
but, no, it didn't.

583
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,492
It didn't.

584
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:12,078
Yeah, I was on <i>Celebrity Apprentice</i>
one season.

585
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,454
-And-- Yes.

586
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,456
-Yeah.

587
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:19,043
Yeah, see? The applause
used to be larger for that.

588
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,839
Yeah.

589
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,674
I won <i>Celebrity Apprentice.</i>

590
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,925
-Yes.

591
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,427
-Yes.

592
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,140
The first black celebrity to win.

593
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,684
I'm the Jackie Robinson
of <i>Celebrity Apprentice.</i>

594
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,232
But we don't get along.

595
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,612
And now people don't give a fuck
 that I won.

596
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,408
'Cause he chose me.

597
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,952
You know what it's like?

598
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,414
It's like being a little puppy who won
the Westminster Dog Show

599
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,708
and then somebody tell you
that we don't give a fuck

600
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:01,461
'cause we found out
Michael Vick was the judge, you know?

601
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,796
- It's like, "Aw, man."

602
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,174
Me and Donald Trump are so different.

603
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,135
I saw him eat a chicken wing
with a knife and fork once.

604
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,304
Yes.

605
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,307
Yeah, and when you poor,
the whole game,

606
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,518
you grow up getting all the meat
off the bone.

607
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,687
Right? You can't--
If Donald Trump was at my house,

608
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,732
my mother would slap the shit out of him
if he picked up a knife and fork.

609
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,442
"Fuck you doing with that knife and fork?

610
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,111
You can't clean that wing
with a knife and fork."

611
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,781
I was a wing ninja when I was little

612
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,200
-'cause you can't get another wing

613
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,160
until you clean the meat off that bone.

614
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:35,286
"Can I have another wing?"

615
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,038
"No, there's more meat on that."

616
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,376
I would decimate a wing, you know?

617
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,213
You could take a wing off my plate
and run it over to CSI.

618
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,215
They wouldn't know what animal it was.
They'd be--

619
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,847
"I think it's a frog,
but this motherfucker,

620
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:57,350
he sucked the DNA out of this bone
right here.

621
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,602
-We don't know what animal this is."

622
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,777
My family, we bite the tip off a wing.

623
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,779
That pointed tip?
And chew that motherfucker.

624
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,697
Swallow that.

625
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,783
If you cook it well done and you eat that?

626
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,036
Can't do that with a knife and fork.
Plus, that look crazy.

627
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,288
You look crazy eating a wing
with a knife and fork.

628
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,417
That's like you coming to bed
to eat her pussy with a lobster bib on

629
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,418
or some shit like that.

630
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,253
-It's like what kind of shit--

631
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,423
The optics on that are very strange, sir.

632
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,555
Bernie Sanders is back.

633
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,432
- Yes!

634
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,558
She said, "Yes!"

635
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,227
She had a Bernie-gasm.

636
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,440
-She said,  "Yes!"

637
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,240
I like Bernie.

638
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:57,410
I would like Bernie if he was
my neighbor or some shit, you know?

639
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,245
But I don't know,
the presidential thing,

640
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,247
I think he missed his window. You know?

641
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,458
Bernie should have run against Lincoln.

642
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,711
-Or somebody.

643
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,590
Yeah, Bernie older than a motherfucker,
Bernie.

644
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,216
-You can look on the internet

645
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,426
and find pictures of Bernie

646
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,762
throwing tea over the boat and shit
back in the day.

647
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,639
That motherfucker old.

648
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,894
You can't be president
if you go to bed at five.

649
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,025
Mm.

650
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,568
I hate politics.

651
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,070
I hate politicians.

652
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,281
-You know? Yeah. I--

653
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,202
I've been around a long time
and it's all the same bullshit.

654
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,537
I'm a republi-crat.

655
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,751
Yeah, that means I'm suspicious
about all them motherfuckers.

656
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,421
Hillary ran against Donald Trump.

657
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,799
I don't trust neither one of 'em.

658
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,176
That's like asking me
who my favorite Menendez brother is

659
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,969
-or some shit, you know?

660
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,180
Fucking Hillary and Donald Trump.

661
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,641
I don't know.
Erik, Lyle, either one of 'em.

662
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,476
Eenie meenie miney mo.

663
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:09,857
You know what's interesting?
I look at the audience and I see people

664
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,277
of all colors and everybody's laughing
at the same shit.

665
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:17,740
Maya Angelou used to say
we're more alike than we're unalike.

666
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,244
-We're all in here doing-- Yeah.

667
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,662
-Having fun.

668
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,998
Gotta laugh to keep from crying.

669
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:30,753
The only real difference
in black people and white people

670
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,673
is black people
like lotion more than white people.

671
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,966
-That's all, really.

672
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,718
I read that in a Johns Hopkins' report.

673
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,054
-It's a brilliant piece.

674
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,057
Dry skin is important to us.

675
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,185
My mother was like
the Dry Skin Avenger and shit.

676
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,604
-Dry skin--

677
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,274
Like if you're white there are words
you don't even have to know.

678
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,443
You can tell a lot about a culture
by the words they have.

679
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,029
We have a lot of words for dry skin.

680
00:35:57,113 --> 00:36:00,116
You could be white all your life
and never have to know what "ashy" means.

681
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,576
-You don't have to know.

682
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,329
At no time did your mother ever scream
at you and say, "Look at your ashy ass.

683
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,747
-You can't go to church

684
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,999
with them ashy-ass elbows.

685
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,167
Look at your elbows.

686
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,376
Get me some lotion."

687
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,086
You never dealt with that.

688
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,963
"Rusty." You never heard your mother use,

689
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,214
"Look at your rusty-ass

690
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,508
-motherfucking knees." You know?

691
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,805
If I said to you,
"Look at your rusty-ass elbows,"

692
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,808
you'd probably say,
"Will it affect my FICO score?"

693
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,771
He wouldn't give a fuck
'cause dry skin is a black thing.

694
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,231
-It's a black thing.

695
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:40,364
Yeah, my mother used to get upset
about ashy skin.

696
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,034
I've-- I've seen my mother
sitting in church

697
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,785
and there was a man on her left.

698
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,787
He wasn't a relative.

699
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,665
I saw my mother-- We knew him,
but I saw my mother

700
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,667
while he was singing,
she licked her finger

701
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,127
and rubbed it on his knuckles.

702
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,546
-Motherfucker's knuckles was ashy.

703
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,216
And my mother was like the Ashy Avenger.

704
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,969
She-- "I can't. I can't have
an ashy motherfucker around me."

705
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,435
God's lotion,
that's God's lotion right there.

706
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,443
I had a conversation with my son.

707
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:20,154
Me and my son
were talking about his major.

708
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,157
He chose his major and I'm like,
"Hey, you got to choose for yourself.

709
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,700
I don't know what to tell you to do.

710
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:29,288
I just hope that you can educate yourself
and give back to your community

711
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:30,623
-in some way."

712
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:34,043
You know? And that's--
I didn't know what else to tell him.

713
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,838
Like I told him, I said, "We need
scientists that deal with black problems,"

714
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,049
like somebody to work on the lotion pump.

715
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,384
-I told him.

716
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,262
That's the talk you've gotta have
with young black men now,

717
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,221
about the lotion pump.

718
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,974
I told him, "We need a scientist--
You ever notice how the lotion pump

719
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,475
coagulates too quickly?

720
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,851
Somebody needs to work on it."

721
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,145
I use lotion three times on the hour

722
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:56,816
and sometimes you put lotion in your hand
and right in the middle of the good lotion

723
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,277
-is that hard-ass lotion booger?

724
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,071
That lotion maggot,
that little hard motherfucker?

725
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,491
You trying to get it
out of the good lotion and shit.

726
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,584
Sometimes you don't feel it
'cause you're rushing

727
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,837
and you end up at church
with a lotion booger

728
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,005
on your neck and shit.

729
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,718
People just laugh at you.

730
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,052
They don't even tell you.

731
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,433
<i>♪ Jesus keep me near the cross ♪</i>

732
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,600
Everybody laughing.

733
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,104
"If she knew Jesus he'd tell her
she got a lotion booger her neck."

734
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,651
Who would have imagined--

735
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,863
Like if you went
to a psychic two years ago,

736
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,156
and they told you,

737
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:49,493
"Um... Bill Cosby will be in jail
and OJ will be out."

738
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,832
You would have said,
"Give me my fucking money back.

739
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,959
-You don't know what you're talkin' about.

740
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:57,918
That's impossible."

741
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,048
But here we are.

742
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:07,678
I read an article where OJ said
he wants to be a preacher.

743
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,514
Yeah, that shit made me laugh, too.

744
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:14,602
'Cause if OJ preached, he'd have to preach
the Nine Commandments, okay?

745
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,522
That motherfucker
don't know all ten. Come on.

746
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,276
He don't know all ten.

747
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:31,702
Anybody got a friend that always
got negative shit to say?

748
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,121
To the point where you almost try
to avoid them?

749
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,373
-Anybody? Yes.

750
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,250
Ooh, let's talk about them motherfuckers.

751
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:43,881
Just people that-- You could say,
"Hi," first and, "Beautiful day out."

752
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,467
But they start conversations with,
"You know who got chlamydia?"

753
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,676
-"Stop, man. Stop.

754
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,263
The fuck you bring that
to me for?" You know?

755
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:57,853
But he said to me, out of the blue,

756
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,815
"Yo, man. I didn't know
OJ didn't like you, bruh."

757
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,566
And I'm like, "What?"

758
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,903
This is the Butcher of Brentwood

759
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,780
-you're talking about, okay?

760
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,366
Don't tell me
this motherfucker don't like me.

761
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,160
Somebody who's been accused
of cutting off heads and shit.

762
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,913
Don't tell me
this motherfucker don't like me.

763
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,498
Now that's in me.

764
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,126
I can't stop thinking about that now.

765
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,507
I went to Vegas.

766
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,511
-And apparently OJ lives in Nevada now.

767
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:36,308
Okay, I walk in a restaurant with my girl
after my show, we go to have a steak.

768
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:41,272
And I seat her and then I go
to the bathroom 'cause I'm over 50.

769
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,441
-And...  yeah.

770
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,276
Some of you know what I mean.

771
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,196
You have to pee all the fucking time
when you're over 50.

772
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,825
There are times when I pee
and then I'm washing my hands and I say,

773
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,285
"Hey, I have to pee again."

774
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,501
Where did that pee come from?

775
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,671
I don't need a prostate check.

776
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,340
I should speak to Penn and Teller
about this.

777
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,342
"This pee just reappeared."

778
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,265
So anyway, I seat her and I'm headed
to the bathroom. By the way,

779
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:20,102
don't you hate when bathrooms make us
play gender Jeopardy?

780
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,230
Can't you just put "men" and "women"
on the door?

781
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,691
-We don't need to guess what the fuck

782
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,152
this is and what the garment is--

783
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:33,741
I've gone to bathrooms and it's like
an Amish bonnet and a wave cap.

784
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,243
-I don't wanna guess. I have to pee.

785
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:40,080
I don't want to guess
which is the brother's bathroom.

786
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,961
You ever go to a game or something

787
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,297
and be in the bathroom next to your son?

788
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,634
I've been at a Dodger game
where my son is in the stall next to me

789
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:55,763
and right before I start peeing,
it's like, "Hey, I think Seabiscuit

790
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,057
just came into his stall." It's like...

791
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,934
-I mean, he's peeing and tearing

792
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,019
the fucking urinal up, you know?

793
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,104
I see white dust flyin' and shit.

794
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:08,067
Right? I still haven't peed, you know?

795
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,861
-There's porcelain going over my stall.

796
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:14,031
I see the words "American Standard"
fly that way and I'm like,

797
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,702
"Wow, that's how my dick used to be.
That's how my dick was at one time."

798
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,080
And then he finishes, you know.

799
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,206
And I say...

800
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,296
-But I'll be back.

801
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,842
I digress.

802
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:39,473
So I'm going to the bathroom,
and I think when you fear something,

803
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,725
it finds you in life. Uh...

804
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:44,228
Just as I go to push open the door,

805
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,022
the door opens and it's OJ.

806
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,066
-And I'm standing like this,

807
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:49,984
and all the shit

808
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,194
you said you were gonna say
if you saw him.

809
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,030
"No, I'll just ask that motherfucker,
'What up, killer? What up?'"

810
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,869
-I didn't say none of that shit.

811
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:02,955
I'm gonna tell y'all exactly what I did.

812
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,416
My hand was like this and I said,
 "Ooh, Juice."

813
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,625
That's exactly what I did.

814
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,295
-I don't know what the fuck got into me.

815
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,591
I've never said, "Ooh, juice," in my life.

816
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,302
I've been at Jamba and not said,
"Ooh, juice."

817
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,974
He scared the shit out of me.

818
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,187
I went from Arsenio Hall to Rue Hall.

819
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,448
I hugged him and peed two more times.

820
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,869
I was just in Florida.

821
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,038
They don't want OJ to live in Florida.

822
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:47,333
He's living in Nevada,
but they won't let him come

823
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,667
where he wants to go.

824
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,711
I guess he did a lot of crazy shit.

825
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:55,758
He had to do crazy shit when he was there
'cause there's cocaine kingpins in Florida

826
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,551
-but they're saying, "But not OJ.

827
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,386
-Fuck that nigga, not OJ."

828
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,265
They won't let OJ come down there.

829
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,100
I read stuff I didn't even know about.

830
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,561
I guess when he was there
he had a road rage incident,

831
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:13,442
you know, where OJ was on the freeway
and somebody gave him the finger.

832
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,902
And he followed 'em.

833
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,279
Because OJ love a chase.

834
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,327
Yeah, that motherfucker, he don't care
if he in the front or the back.

835
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,245
He love a freeway chase.

836
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,332
And he followed 'em.

837
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,334
That's the ultimate sign of bad luck.

838
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:34,630
What's the over-under, that with
all the people riding around Florida,

839
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:38,759
you can give somebody the finger
and when you get to a stop sign,

840
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,344
you look in the rear view mirror

841
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,097
and realize it's OJ fuckin' Simpson
behind you?

842
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,182
-That's horrible luck.

843
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,063
Now OJ is coming towards your car,

844
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,773
putting on a glove and shit.

845
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:02,366
Motherfucker dropping socks
and suddenly your mirror says,

846
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,452
"This nigga's head may be larger
than it appears," and shit.

847
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,038
The Juice.

848
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,582
He ain't OJ like he used to be.

849
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,335
It ain't like the commercials
in the airport,

850
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,212
that motherfucker's PJ now.
He's prune juice.

851
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,547
That motherfucker's knees--

852
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:20,467
If the light change,
he might not get to your fucking car.

853
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:24,805
It's a new day.

854
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,641
A new day.

855
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,476
You ladies...

856
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,355
first generation of ladies to grow up...

857
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,566
in a Viagra society.

858
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,737
That shit sound funny now,

859
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,448
but wait till you're 90
and don't want to fuck.

860
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:47,494
You're the first generation of women
that have to fuck forever.

861
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:48,746
You have to fuck till you die.

862
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,372
You don't never get to stop fucking.

863
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:55,127
Your grandma used to be able to get old
and water her plants and shit

864
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,837
and there's no more fucking now.

865
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,470
You guys at 90 are gonna be crazy
with that pill, you know?

866
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,054
-Motherfuckers 90 years old,

867
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:08,432
"I knocked the dust off that pussy
last night."

868
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,851
-You know? It's like, "Oh, Grandpa."

869
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,857
Remember you could
stop by Grandma's house anytime?

870
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,237
You never had to call Grandma.

871
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,239
You could just open the door.

872
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,576
You could send your kids, "Go on,
I'm gonna park the car. Y'all go on in."

873
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,952
You can't send your kids

874
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,288
-in Grandma's house now.

875
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:35,876
Your kids will be traumatized
forever and shit.

876
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,297
Kids come back out to the car...

877
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,428
"What's wrong?"

878
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:50,057
-"Grandma was butt naked in a swing.

879
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,476
And I don't know what it means.

880
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,519
I don't know.

881
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,563
It just hurt me."

882
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,611
Everything's changing.

883
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,738
This has changed a lot.

884
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,407
This is my favorite thing in the world.

885
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,784
My woman hates this.

886
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,494
My phone.

887
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,454
She's like, "You're always
on that damn phone."

888
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,706
It's everything for me.

889
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,251
I pay my bills here, it's my flashlight,

890
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,920
-it's my photo album, it's my camera...

891
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,129
Right?

892
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,591
It's actually everything
but a phone for me.

893
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,389
How many get mad when somebody
call you on the fucking phone?

894
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,683
-It's a new day.

895
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,145
Right? You're like, "Who--
Text me, motherfucker.

896
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,149
What old motherfucker is calling me

897
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,444
and leaving a voicemail?
Look at him leaving a--

898
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,824
Oh, that's grandma.
She said, 'Don't come back.'

899
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,456
She sent the Ben Wa balls emoji.

900
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:00,919
Grandma crazy."

901
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,048
This is important.

902
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:10,220
I got a new case.
I get a new case every couple months.

903
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,640
My girl says
I take my phone clothes shopping.

904
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,269
I do.

905
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:21,607
I take her, too. You know,
I go to the Apple Store and get a new case

906
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,901
and I let her go next door to Forever 41.

907
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:31,909
You can tell how important something is
by how you react when you lose it.

908
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,996
-You ever misplaced your phone?

909
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:40,542
I misplaced my phone earlier today
and got heart palpitations.

910
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:46,006
You're not supposed to get heart
palpitations over misplacing your phone.

911
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,050
I left my son in the mall
when he was little

912
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,677
-and didn't get heart palpitations.

913
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,932
That's too important.

914
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,852
It makes you crazy.

915
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,815
I've actually been looking for mine
and realized I was on the motherfucker.

916
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,617
I've actually said, "Wait.
Hold on for a minute."

917
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,412
I did that today.

918
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,498
That San Jose weed

919
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,583
-is a motherfucker there.

920
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,835
-Oh, it's crazy up here.

921
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,253
It's crazy.

922
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,631
"Where's my phone?"

923
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:34,888
It's amazing, all over the world,
how celebrities get away with shit.

924
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:38,308
I was reading the article
about Oscar Pistorius, the blade runner.

925
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,603
He got six years
for killing an innocent woman,

926
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,231
and now they're gonna give him 13,
but that's still not enough.

927
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,193
You all know who I'm talking about,
Oscar Pistorius, the blade runner,

928
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,194
killed his girlfriend?

929
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:51,363
I can't stand
that spatula-foot motherfucker.

930
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,614
-I can't stand him.

931
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,117
This motherfucker-- I can't stand
this motherfucker right here.

932
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,871
He wants his legs in jail,
'cause they won't let him have his legs.

933
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,873
They can be used as a weapon or something.

934
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:02,874
And he wants his legs.

935
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,961
Plus, I don't want him comfortable.
I don't care what you want.

936
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,922
You killed an innocent girl.
You should be uncomfortable.

937
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:13,301
I want you in the shower every morning
with big South African dicks in your face.

938
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,386
-That's--

939
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,513
That's how you gonna do your 13 years.

940
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,890
You know?
I wanna see a motherfucker like this...

941
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,026
"Come on, Mobotu. Stop, now. Stop.

942
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,655
You're uncircumcised.
Your dick stinks, stop.

943
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,205
I'm trying to shower."

944
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,126
He said he woke up
in the middle of the night

945
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,170
'cause he heard noise in the bathroom,

946
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,464
but he didn't check to see
where his woman was.

947
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,548
He didn't even look.

948
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,842
Come on, guys. You look.

949
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:57,429
You wake up and the first thing you do
is you see where your woman is.

950
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:00,724
And if your woman's not in bed,
and you're a real man,

951
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,685
your first thought is,
"Oh, shit. Where's my cell phone?"

952
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,687
-That's your first thought.

953
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,449
Yeah.

954
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,992
I don't even go to the bathroom.

955
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,286
I go to the top of the steps,
"Baby, you got my phone?

956
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,663
-You downstairs? You got my phone?

957
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,249
Stop fucking around and get my phone."

958
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,586
My woman's always in my shit.

959
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,130
I had to have some iPajamas made.

960
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:35,467
I had pajamas made with a pocket
so I can get some sleep.

961
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,676
-You know?

962
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,971
I had pajamas with a passcode made
and shit.

963
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,103
But she's the Copernicus
of getting in a phone.

964
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:49,439
She getting in a motherfucker's phone
no matter what phone you got.

965
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,817
I remember when I used to
have passcode digits.

966
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,068
I woke up one night

967
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:55,904
and I heard-- This is what I heard:

968
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:58,573
-I was like, "What the fuck is that?"

969
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:02,327
I look on the side of the bed,
she's got my phone doing this:

970
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,039
That's some slick shit.

971
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,251
Yeah. Oh, y'all know that up here.

972
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,418
You ladies,

973
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:11,837
y'all ain't shit.

974
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,714
Yeah, y'all know that you breathe
on the phone and fog it up

975
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,342
and you can see the most frequently
tapped password numbers.

976
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,344
Yeah, you're like,

977
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:22,514
"Uh-huh, that's his father's birthday
right there. That's what that is."

978
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:27,477
Oh, she's a trip.

979
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,647
Hey, I woke up one night
and she had my phone,

980
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:31,690
she was over me,

981
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,317
and had my thumb, too,
and she was doing this

982
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,069
-on the new phone.

983
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:38,155
I'm like, "Hey, give me my shit!

984
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,285
You're not gonna bust me
with my own fucking thumb.

985
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,415
Nigga can't even get an Ambien nap
in this motherfucker.

986
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,501
I smell pee."

987
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,800
Now I got the facial recognition.

988
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,596
It's gonna take her at least a week.

989
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,350
'Cause eventually,
she'll figure this shit out.

990
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,104
Eventually, she'll have hair
around her mouth

991
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,691
looking at my phone talking about,

992
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:17,068
- "If loving you is wrong,

993
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,029
I don't wanna be right."

994
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,996
Hey, we're getting ready
to do a sequel, y'all.

995
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:31,458
<i>Coming to America 2.</i>

996
00:53:32,834 --> 00:53:33,668
Yes.

997
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:35,420
I'm excited.

998
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,464
We old as hell, though,

999
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:38,715
-30 years later.

1000
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:43,178
We so old, we won't have to use makeup
for the barbers this time around.

1001
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,725
The sequel was based on a true story.

1002
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,229
Um, Akeem and Semmi come to America

1003
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,481
and beat the shit
out of Jussie Smollett for that--

1004
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,899
-Yeah.

1005
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,692
-Everybody's mad. Every...

1006
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,779
Nigeria, Wakanda, Zamunda.

1007
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:03,657
Everybody's upset at what he did.
It's not just Chicago.

1008
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,662
"Semmi, get me the bleach."

1009
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,670
I mentioned my girl earlier.

1010
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,129
My woman is younger than me

1011
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,757
'cause I'm in show business and...

1012
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,345
I love listening to her music.

1013
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:31,434
And sometimes I realize
my oldies are gonna be better than hers.

1014
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:32,602
You know?

1015
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:36,273
I love the period I grew up in.
I grew up listening to The Beatles

1016
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:39,818
-and Earth, Wind & Fire, you know?

1017
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,488
Oh, man, my favorite writer
is Stevie Wonder.

1018
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,115
-Yes.

1019
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,492
Yeah, if you're in love with somebody,
when you get home,

1020
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:51,663
Google "As," A-S,
and play it for the one you love.

1021
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,000
"As around the sun
the earth knows she's revolving.

1022
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:55,959
Yeah!

1023
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,628
And the rosebuds know
to bloom in early May.

1024
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,714
Just as hate knows love's the cure,

1025
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,674
you can bet your mind assure

1026
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:05,510
-that I'll be loving you always."

1027
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,846
-Yes.

1028
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,517
Fucking Steve.
He put his foot in that motherfucker.

1029
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,437
-My woman ain't got no oldies like that.

1030
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,692
You know, when she's 90,
she gonna be talkin' about,

1031
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:24,195
-♪<i> Shake that ass, watch yourself ♪</i>

1032
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,950
I love Mystikal, but that's not
a good song for the elderly.

1033
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:32,704
You don't want Grandma

1034
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:35,540
at Thanksgiving walking
with mac and cheese, talkin' about,

1035
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,376
<i>-♪ I come in with a dick in my hand ♪</i>

1036
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,753
"Yo, Grandma.

1037
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,881
Put the mac and cheese down, Grandma."

1038
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,806
I love listening to my son's music.

1039
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:53,350
Keeps me young.

1040
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,603
And he turns me onto stuff,
I turn him onto stuff.

1041
00:55:57,187 --> 00:56:00,982
He told me one day, he said, "Dad,
remember you played Otis Redding for me?"

1042
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,192
And he said,

1043
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,279
"Jay-Z has a track
where he samples Otis Redding."

1044
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,198
And I'm like, "Oh, yeah."

1045
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,240
And...

1046
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:12,077
when he came home, I wanted him to hear--

1047
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:14,871
I forgot what I played for him,
but I wanted him to hear

1048
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,665
"Dock of the Bay"
'cause he had never heard that song.

1049
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,292
And...

1050
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,461
this is his stereo.

1051
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:26,758
So I said when you get home, also,
I want you to see my stereo from college,

1052
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,301
-which I still have

1053
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,719
in the garage, you know?

1054
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,014
I took him out in the garage and I said,
"That's Daddy's stereo." He said, "Where?"

1055
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,599
I said, "All this shit right here.

1056
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:35,809
-All this.

1057
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,522
Here, help me with this speaker.
Help me take the speaker."

1058
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:47,695
And we put it together.
He said, "Dad, what'd you do

1059
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,739
when you wanted to take the music
to another room?"

1060
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:50,949
And I said, "Shut the fuck up

1061
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:52,867
-and just help me put this together.

1062
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,911
Making me feel bad about my childhood.

1063
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,287
You turn the shit up.

1064
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,628
You want me to plug it in
and pair up the speakers?

1065
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:06,131
You lazy motherfucker.
We didn't have no pairing.

1066
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:09,509
No, you eat a pear back then.
You don't pair your speakers.

1067
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,597
Put all this shit together.

1068
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,558
I take the red and black wire

1069
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,518
-and I bite the rubber off

1070
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,437
and expose the copper,

1071
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,647
-get it in the hole back here.

1072
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,738
Help Daddy find this hole.
I can't get the copper in the hole."

1073
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:39,456
We put it together and I had
<i>Otis Redding's Greatest Hits</i> and I'm like,

1074
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,584
"I know Jay-Z sampled it,
but I want you to hear the totality

1075
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,461
of this man's gift." You know?

1076
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,754
And the track...

1077
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,423
skipped.

1078
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,551
"Dock of the Bay," yeah.
I put it on, it said,

1079
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,513
-"Sittin' in... Sittin' in... Sittin'..."

1080
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,978
See, I see some young faces.
Y'all don't even know what skipping is.

1081
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,190
Buffering, for you. Buffering.

1082
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:08,568
Buffering, for you.

1083
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,200
But you know what I did? I remembered
something my mother taught me.

1084
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:16,993
Put a quarter on the arm

1085
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:19,537
-and it weighs the arm down and you can

1086
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,748
play a record that has a scratch in it.

1087
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,042
I put it on and it worked.

1088
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,085
And we got to listen to "Dock of the Bay."

1089
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:29,422
And I heard the words different
than I've ever heard them before.

1090
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:30,381
You know?

1091
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,759
I think when you're a father
you listen differently.

1092
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,719
<i>♪ Sittin' in the morning sun ♪</i>

1093
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:36,721
<i>♪ I'll be sittin' when the evening comes ♪</i>

1094
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:37,889
And it dawned on me.

1095
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,600
This is about a lazy motherfucker,
this song right here.

1096
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:45,813
That's all you do,
is watch the ships roll in

1097
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,233
and then watch 'em and roll away again?

1098
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,528
You ain't got no wife, no kids,
you can't play Candy Crush.

1099
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,862
There's no phone yet.

1100
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:57,367
I'm surprised you could write a good song.

1101
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,993
-You don't do shit.

1102
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,246
Maybe that's why so much of that song is--

1103
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,172
Mm.

1104
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:15,343
Thank you once again for coming out.
I appreciate you all being here.

1105
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,470
-Yeah.

1106
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:19,973
Yes.

1107
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:24,227
If you can, follow me
on all the social media platforms.

1108
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,479
You know, Facebook and Instagram--

1109
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,814
I like Facebook and Instagram.

1110
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:29,399
-Twitter is mean.

1111
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,735
You ever notice how mean Twitter is?
Twitter, I don't know--

1112
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:36,447
People follow me,
but they hate me, it seems. You know?

1113
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:38,866
-It's people who I don't even know.

1114
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,786
That's the craziest thing.
We're talking to people we don't know.

1115
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,706
It's like leaving your car door open
at a red light

1116
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:46,249
and having somebody just get in

1117
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:48,918
-and say, "Hey, nigger," and then leave.

1118
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,004
"Who was that racist that got in my car?"

1119
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:54,632
We're entertaining crazy motherfuckers.

1120
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,636
But Instagram, I never--
Maybe it's just my followers,

1121
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,680
or it's just me, but on Instagram,

1122
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,349
pictures, you send a picture, you know?

1123
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,603
One time I was on a private plane,
I sent a picture of my breakfast

1124
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,939
on this plane and I put hashtag "eggs"

1125
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,483
and you know, people we're like,
"Oh, that's cool. That's cool."

1126
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,444
And on Instagram you get "likes."

1127
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,571
If you put that picture on Twitter,

1128
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,573
people would be like,
"Fuck your eggs, nigga."

1129
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:19,991
-You know, it's like--

1130
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:22,869
So why are they so mean? What did I do?

1131
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,622
"Stick your eggs up your ass,
motherfucker."

1132
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:29,459
Yeah, I'll take Instagram.

1133
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,461
Plus, I love the name.
I'm an OG.

1134
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:34,672
I remember when Instagram
was a cocaine delivery service and shit.

1135
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:35,923
-Yeah.

1136
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,133
Back in the day.

1137
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,721
My friend used to run
that motherfucker, you know?

1138
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,473
-He'd arrive at your door,

1139
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,933
- "Yo, I got your gram.

1140
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,686
-It's Instagram. I got your gram.

1141
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,273
You get a free coke spoon. Here."

1142
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:03,576
I have a picture of Mike Tyson
on my Twitter page.

1143
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,161
This is how mean Twitter is.

1144
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,579
This is a Sunday morning.

1145
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:09,248
I decided to look and see if anybody
said anything about my show

1146
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:10,249
on Saturday night.

1147
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,251
I usually don't read the shit.

1148
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:17,799
The first thing I see, the guy says,
"Didn't you and Mike Tyson used to fuck?"

1149
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,017
"What'd I do? You're following me...

1150
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,856
Happy Sunday to you, motherfucker.
Happy Sunday to you."

1151
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:40,196
I didn't know how to take it,
it was just so much.

1152
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,823
All at once.You know?

1153
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:45,243
First of all, I wasn't mad
that he was calling me gay.

1154
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:48,121
I was mad that he was
calling me stupid, you know?

1155
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,123
-'Cause you don't have to know a lot

1156
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:51,040
about Mike Tyson.

1157
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,127
You don't have to know his win-loss record
or who Cus D'Amato was,

1158
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:57,088
but all of you know
that he bit some shit off once.

1159
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,841
-I bet all of y'all know that, right?

1160
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,468
So if you're gay, you're still not
going to fuck with Mike Tyson.

1161
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,638
That's suicide. That's an insane move.

1162
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:09,642
Nobody fucking with Mike Tyson.
Elton John wouldn't fuck Mike Tyson.

1163
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,311
-Fucking Elton John would be like,

1164
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,230
"Not my Rocket Man." You know?

1165
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:16,274
-Thank you, San Jose.

1166
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,238
Thank you very much.

1167
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,991
-I appreciate you.

1168
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,872
