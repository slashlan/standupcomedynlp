00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,260
[audience laughing]

2
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:13,430
[Norm Macdonald] <i>Then people go,</i>
<i>"Goddamn, at least he's not a hypocrite."</i>

3
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:15,057
[laughter]

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>"You've got to give it to him,
that's the worst part of it."</i>

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,103
[laughter]

6
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,356
<i>All right.</i>

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,568
<i>I ate a pork chop. I don't want to brag
or anything like that.</i>

8
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:27,653
[laughter]

9
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,822
<i>But it's in my belly right now
as we speak.</i>

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>And I realized that you...
you eat at a restaurant</i>

11
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,247
<i>different than you eat at home, you know?</i>

12
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,167
Like, at home you would never cook up
a pork chop on your skillet, you know,

13
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,794
and make it nice and hot on one side,

14
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,797
then turn it over,
make it hot on the other side,

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,173
and then cut into it
and see how it's going in the middle.

16
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:53,637
And then you go, "Man, I'm going to love
eating this delicious pork chop.

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,598
As soon as it's hot enough to eat,
I'll eat it.

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,058
But while I'm waiting,

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,769
I'm going to eat a big loaf of bread."

20
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,853
[laughter]

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,856
Who would do that?

22
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,487
"With, like, 35 pats of butter,
and I'll eat that loaf of bread."

23
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,033
"And that will get my appetite
sharpened up...

24
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:16,118
[laughter]

25
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,495
for the pork."

26
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,587
I also noticed
that desserts are different nowadays.

27
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,257
When I was young,
the waiter would come and go,

28
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,635
"What do you want for dessert -
cherry pie or apple pie?"

29
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,514
And you would go,
"I will have a cherry pie."

30
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,101
And the guy would bring me... Very simple.
You know, things were simple back then.

31
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,438
Now desserts - oh, my Lord!

32
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,859
The guy shows up
and he's got a big tray at a canted angle,

33
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,154
and every confection
known to man is on it.

34
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,405
He's...

35
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,073
And I don't like the way he talks,

36
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:58,160
because he doesn't talk,
like, the pork-chop talk any more.

37
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:03,457
All of a sudden, for the dessert,
he's, like, all the sexual undertones.

38
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,541
You know, the...

39
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,459
[laughter]

40
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,878
I mean, he's all like, "Ah."

41
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:11,632
"Why are you saying 'ah' like that?"
He's like, "Ah."

42
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:12,716
[laughter]

43
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,846
"May I tempt you with something?"

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,681
"Tempt me?"

45
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:20,766
[laughter]

46
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:26,229
"Do you like decadent things?"

47
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,314
"Well, I don't..."

48
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:33,362
"I hope you left some room in your belly."
"OK, listen."

49
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,613
[laughter]

50
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,950
"Are we still talking about desserts here?
What the... is going on?"

51
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:43,497
"I don't want to end up blowing you
in the bathroom or something."

52
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,581
[laughter]

53
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,293
"I don't want to end up blowing the guy
in the bathroom. Listen...

54
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,839
I can be tricked
as much as the next fellow, and...

55
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:53,924
[laughter]

56
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,301
I don't want to be in the bathroom.

57
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,803
Hey! Wait a second! Whoa!"

58
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,887
[laughter]

59
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,765
"Hold on here, maestro! I..."

60
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,061
"I thought we were talking about
a butterscotch pudding or something."

61
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,900
"I don't care much for you, Captain,
I'll tell you that right now."

62
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,197
"I'll continue, I'm a man of my word,
but I'll say this."

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,281
[laughter]

64
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,283
"I'll say this, Chief."

65
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:25,122
"Were my word not my bond,
then none of this..."

66
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:29,459
"I'm doing it reluctantly.
I don't know if you noticed that, but..."

67
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,545
[laughter and applause]

68
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,259
Sex to me is...

69
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,179
First of all, I'm an old man, you know?

70
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:44,641
I... I'm like uh... threescore and...

71
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,227
twelve, or something like that.

72
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,311
[laughter]

73
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,399
I'm trying to get "score" going again.

74
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,277
[chuckles]

75
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,571
I feel that Lincoln,

76
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,407
when he thought that up,
he thought that was going to go.

77
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,616
You know what I mean?

78
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,784
[laughter]

79
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:05,328
Like, his wife was like,
"Why don't you just say '87'?"

80
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,414
He's like,
"Why don't you shut the fuck up?"

81
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,498
[laughter]

82
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,544
"Last I checked,
I was the orator in the family

83
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,547
and you were the fucking insane lady."

84
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,631
[laughter]

85
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,634
"When I say fourscore and seven,
believe me...

86
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,388
'score' is going to catch on big time."

87
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,472
But...

88
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,308
it never did.

89
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,106
Here's another little presidential thing.

90
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,610
You know there's a story
about George Washington,

91
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:40,363
and they say,
"Oh, He chopped down a cherry tree,"

92
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,531
when he was a little child.

93
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,577
When his parents came home they said,
"Who chopped down the cherry tree?"

94
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,413
and Little George said, "It was I
who chopped down the cherry tree.

95
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,499
I cannot tell a lie."

96
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,459
And you go, "Wow! What a great story."

97
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,587
But then you think about it
a little bit, right?

98
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,340
Imagine if you drove home
to your house, right?

99
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,512
And you get there and go, "Hey, what
the fuck happened to the cherry tree?"

100
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,596
[laughter]

101
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,389
"Did somebody chop it down or something?"

102
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,017
And then you go inside,

103
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,687
and there's your child... with an axe.

104
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,772
[laughter]

105
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,275
So you go,
"What happened to the cherry tree?"

106
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,652
and then he goes,

107
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,946
"I chopped down the cherry tree."

108
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,241
"I cannot tell a lie."

109
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,201
And then you go, "OK."

110
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,997
"The first part of what you said,
it bothers me a lot."

111
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:32,082
[laughter]

112
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,503
"The second part
scares the fuck out of me. You..."

113
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,587
[laughter]

114
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,297
"You can't tell a lie?"

115
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,592
"You're incapable of lying?"

116
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,223
That would...

117
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,016
That would scare me.

118
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,309
[laughter]

119
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,605
Now I live in LA. We go to parties in LA.

120
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:58,358
And I go, too, but I'm no good at them.

121
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,444
Here's my problem - I have no opinions.

122
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,322
You know how people have opinions?

123
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,449
I don't got none. I...

124
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,827
Like political and...

125
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,497
So sometimes before I go to a party,
I'll just turn on the TV,

126
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,624
and whatever that guy said, I'll say that.

127
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:15,709
[laughter]

128
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,464
But I'm not good...

129
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,759
Like, when I go to parties,
I don't want serious discussions.

130
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,887
I try to find somebody
that is at my same level.

131
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,431
And I'm good at it. I can...

132
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,893
Like, you know how they say guys have
gaydar - they can see other gay people?

133
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,189
I'm like that
with guys at my same level of smartness.

134
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,318
Like, I can see a guy
in the corner and go,

135
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,903
"I can keep up
with that motherfucker right there."

136
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:44,988
[laughter]

137
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,617
And then I make a beeline
for that character.

138
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,079
And then we talk about <i>Jughead</i> comics
for a couple of hours...

139
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,164
[laughter]

140
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,499
and everything's fine.

141
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,880
Sometimes people go,
"Why do you even go to these parties

142
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,673
if you don't like, you know, talking?"

143
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,300
Here's why I go to parties.

144
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,636
There's only one reason
why I go to parties.

145
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:12,474
The reason why I love parties,
because I love those little sandwiches

146
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,017
where they're triangles...

147
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,143
[laughter]

148
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,895
and they cut the crusts off,

149
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,482
and then they're
little equilateral triangles,

150
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,068
and they put a little toothpick.

151
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,198
And it has, like, golden cellophane...

152
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,282
[laughter]

153
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,492
and red cellophane.

154
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,786
I can eat 30, 40 of those fuckers.

155
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,665
And you can only get them at parties.

156
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,334
Like...
I have gone to restaurants and I go,

157
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,921
"You got any of them sandwiches
that are shaped like triangles?"

158
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,384
And they go, "No, all our sandwiches
are shaped like sandwiches."

159
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,551
I go, "Oh, fuck."

160
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,053
And then...

161
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,597
I go to, like, a grocery store.

162
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:57,143
I go, "Yes, where is... What aisle
is the sandwiches with the toothpicks?"

163
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,645
They go, "We don't got none."

164
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,814
"Have you tried a party?"

165
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,399
I go, "I'm trying not to...

166
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,900
[laughter]

167
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,235
go to those things."

168
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,741
But I don't drink,
so I'm no good at parties for that reason.

169
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,577
And drugs, I don't do them. Used to.

170
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,914
When I was a boy, young,
I would do anything, you know?

171
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:22,752
LSD, that was about the strongest drug
I ever did - acid.

172
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,713
I don't know
if you've ever done acid, but...

173
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,548
When I was young, they would tell me,

174
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,135
"You have got to be careful with
that acid, on account of you can do it,

175
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,220
and then you have a flashback.

176
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,098
Like, ten years could pass,
20 years could pass,

177
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,976
and then you get a flashback."

178
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,770
So I thought, "Well, that sounds like
a good deal," you know?

179
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:41,855
[laughter]

180
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,567
I went to my drug dealer Frank.

181
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,693
I said, "Frank...

182
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,739
is there a drug on the market
where I pay you $5...

183
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,701
I take the drug, I get high,

184
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,120
and then, 20 years later,
I get high again?"

185
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,204
[laughter]

186
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,206
He said yes.

187
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:05,420
And I think of myself as somebody
who's good at stretching his drug dollar.

188
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,504
[laughter]

189
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,300
But the point of the whole thing

190
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,844
is for me to tell you young folk...

191
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,806
that it's not...
it's not true at all, you know?

192
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,726
Because I have not done LSD
since I was a teenager.

193
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,145
Ten years have passed,
20 years have passed.

194
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,981
Sadly, 30 years have passed.

195
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,066
[laughter]

196
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,150
And still...

197
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,486
no flash...

198
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,112
What a gyp that turned out to be.

199
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,197
I...

200
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,281
[laughter]

201
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,828
Just more horseshit
by the big acid companies if you ask me.

202
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,913
I don't want to...

203
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,582
I don't want to get too political, but...

204
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,666
[laughter]

205
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,378
if you think big acid...

206
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,632
cares about you, the little guy...

207
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,716
[laughter]

208
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,804
They care about
their third-quarter profits.

209
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,263
That's what they care about.

210
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,348
[laughter]

211
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,686
[chuckles]

212
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,064
You know, my friend is a vegetarian.

213
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,358
And have you ever been wrong,

214
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,986
and you suddenly realize,
you know, like...

215
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:16,449
Because she... all her arguments
are right about vegetarianism.

216
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,077
She'll go, like,
"How can you kill an animal

217
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,205
when you can get the same
from the grass of the field?

218
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,581
It makes no sense."

219
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,459
And then I go, "I like pork."

220
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,544
[laughter]

221
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,087
So...

222
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,423
Of course, she's right...

223
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:34,926
and I'm wrong.

224
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,972
And it's weird
when you realize you have been wrong

225
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,767
about everything that you ever believed -
about vegetarianism, not everything.

226
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,816
Imagine if you woke up and you realized
you were wrong about everything.

227
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,359
You just woke up and you go,

228
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:56,906
"Goddamn. I have been wrong about
every single thing I have ever believed."

229
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,491
[chuckles]

230
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,576
[laughter]

231
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,583
Then it's time to go down to
the rope store in my opinion, because...

232
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,667
[laughter]

233
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,628
it's not going to get better, you know?

234
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,343
Go to the rope store -
that's my suggestion to you...

235
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,973
and get a hunk of rope about this big...

236
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,560
and then go to the rickety-stool store.

237
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,644
[laughter]

238
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,318
And, listen, it's no coincidence

239
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,445
that the rope store
and the rickety-stool store

240
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,572
are always right beside each other, right?

241
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,656
[laughter]

242
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,201
I don't want to get political
or anything like that, but...

243
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,286
[laughter]

244
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,377
When people commit suicide, no one
ever understands. You know what I mean?

245
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,589
People commit suicide and people go,
"I don't understand why,"

246
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:55,840
and I go, "You don't?"

247
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:56,925
[laughter]

248
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:05,016
"What, do you live in a cotton-candy house
or something? What the fuck?"

249
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,267
[laughter]

250
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,852
"You don't know about life?"

251
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,105
"How it only disappoints and...

252
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,902
gets worse and worse,
until it ends in a catastrophe?"

253
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:16,986
[laughter]

254
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,364
"What the fuck?"

255
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,448
[laughter]

256
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,828
There's two reasons
guys will hang themselves from the neck.

257
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,164
One is, like we said,

258
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:33,252
to escape this worthless masquerade
of a life we pretend we have.

259
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,337
[laughter]

260
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:39,884
And the second reason we hang ourselves
from the neck is to whack off.

261
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:40,969
These guys...

262
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,053
[laughter]

263
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,764
I don't understand.

264
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,020
It's called autoerotic asphyxiation.

265
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,606
It's a big, fancy word,
but it's a filthy thing.

266
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,691
[laughter]

267
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,277
And this is my problem with it.

268
00:12:58,361 --> 00:13:00,071
The risk-reward...

269
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,155
[laughter]

270
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,324
is not good.

271
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,996
And I know of the reward
because I read about it.

272
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,332
Apparently, by cutting off the oxygen,
or something like that,

273
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,668
you increase your orgasm

274
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,255
until it's
one-and-a-half times as powerful

275
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:20,216
as the one you had
the Thursday before last.

276
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,300
[laughter]

277
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,348
Is that really that important?

278
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,476
I mean,
we have a lot of things in this country.

279
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,395
You know, it's raining in the forest.

280
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:36,691
There's all kinds of shit we have
to think about... let alone whacking off.

281
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,109
That's our big problem?

282
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,659
But the risk - good Lord!

283
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:47,744
[laughter]

284
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,332
People always wonder,
"What happens after you die?"

285
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,126
No one knows, you know?

286
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,711
People pretend to know,

287
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,672
but no one knows
what happens after you die.

288
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,509
But I know what happens to you
right after you die.

289
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:06,512
I know what happens
directly after you die.

290
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,682
You are found.

291
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:10,767
[laughter]

292
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,648
And this is where it gets tricky.

293
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:18,733
[laughter]

294
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,528
And it's always by a loved one.

295
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,572
You know?

296
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,700
And you don't want your son walking in,
going, "Ah! What the fuck?"

297
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,120
"What the fuck is Dad...
What kind... Huh?"

298
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,205
[laughter]

299
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,960
And that's how you'll be remembered
forever, you know?

300
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,546
It doesn't matter
what else you accomplish in life.

301
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,675
See, people are under the misapprehension

302
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,180
that their life is like a motion picture
that will be remembered as such,

303
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,306
but it's not.

304
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,183
It's just a photograph, you know?

305
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,477
A still photograph,

306
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,021
and that's unfortunately how it is.

307
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,981
But, you know, like,

308
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,776
if you think your son
will remember you as,

309
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:07,156
"I remember my dad took me
to Disneyland in the blistering heat,

310
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,370
and, by God, he stood in line
to get Mickey Mouse's autograph.

311
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,080
It took him two hours.

312
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:18,209
It was for me. He knew it wasn't
the real Mickey Mouse. He had to have."

313
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,293
[laughter]

314
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,214
"It was an unemployed college kid."

315
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,968
"And yet he stayed - stayed for me."

316
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,386
[chuckles]

317
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,470
"Dad."

318
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,931
"He had two jobs.

319
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,851
You know, to put food on my plate,

320
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,686
and my brother's and my mom's."

321
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,729
"Two jobs.

322
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,940
And I remember one time -
I'll never forget it -

323
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,900
he came home late at night
and I was in bed.

324
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,069
I was pretending to be asleep,
but I wasn't.

325
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,155
And he came in,

326
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,699
and he was very quiet,
and he came up to me,

327
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,453
and he kissed me
on that area between my uh...

328
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,664
my um... forehead
and the bridge of my nose.

329
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,040
He kissed me right there,

330
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,751
and he said -
quietly, so as not to wake me -

331
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,420
'I love you, son, '

332
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,963
and then he left.

333
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:08,426
And the next day, I wanted to say
something to him at the breakfast table,

334
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,344
but he was already out,
he was driving hack.

335
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,929
That was his second job."

336
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,516
"But, my God, my dad..."

337
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,311
Anyways, they don't remember that at all.
All they remember is...

338
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,395
"Ah!"

339
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,521
You know? Because...

340
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,856
[laughter and applause]

341
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,449
Unfortunately,
that's the way human beings are.

342
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,533
[laughter]

343
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,660
[coughs]

344
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,168
[sighs]

345
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,340
I think if I were to do it -
and I don't think I ever would...

346
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,051
But you never know.

347
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,386
You can't predict the future.

348
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,847
I could wake up one day and go,

349
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,267
"I want to have one of them orgasms

350
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,852
that's uh...

351
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,398
three-over-two times as strong as the..."

352
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:05,483
[laughter]

353
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,652
[chuckles]

354
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:12,448
"I knew that advanced-math degree
was going to come in handy sometimes,

355
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,116
I just did not know when."

356
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,579
This is what I would do
if it ever happened to me.

357
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:23,584
I would disguise it
so it looked like an actual suicide,

358
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,671
because then, when I was found,

359
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,756
my son wouldn't go, "Ah!"

360
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,384
he would go, "Oh! Oh, mysterious."

361
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,468
[laughter]

362
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,347
"Dad's a mysterious guy."

363
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,598
[chuckles]

364
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,226
"This is going to be
a pretty cool story for me right now."

365
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:48,025
So I would pretend, you know,
that it was a... it was a real suicide.

366
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:51,404
Like, I would write a note -
a suicide note.

367
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,493
Do you think this would be funny,
just as a practical joke,

368
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,872
if you just wrote a suicide note
and just blamed some random guy?

369
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:03,874
Do you think that would be...

370
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,876
Do you know what I mean?

371
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,336
[laughter and applause]

372
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,131
You know, like, your barber
or something like that, you know?

373
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,215
[laughter]

374
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:15,177
You go,
"It was all Ralph Abernathy's fault!"

375
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,262
[laughter]

376
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,308
Because you know the police

377
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,311
would be compelled
to go to Abernathy's barber shop...

378
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:27,648
and go, "Have you ever heard of a fellow,
name of Norm Macdonald?"

379
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,860
The guy goes, "Yeah, he would come in
every couple of months for a trim."

380
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,864
"Oh, OK. Well, anyways,
he took his life because of you."

381
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,948
[laughter]

382
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,620
"He wrote it here in this letter.
Would you like to keep the...?"

383
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:49,045
Then Ralph Abernethy would have to spend
the rest of his life walking down...

384
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,129
[laughter]

385
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:58,137
Life's hard enough
without having to walk...

386
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,482
That's not a good practical joke.

387
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,402
I should never have...
framed that as a good practical joke,

388
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,072
because it's probably
the worst practical joke...

389
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,156
[laughter]

390
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,240
You know?

391
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,037
It's the kind of practical joke that gets
you raped by the devil for all of time.

392
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,121
[laughter]

393
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:36,509
I uh came here from Las Vegas, Nevada,

394
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,344
and when I was at the air...

395
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,679
Uh...

396
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,306
Where do airplanes go from? Airports.

397
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,391
[laughter]

398
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:48,062
I was in the airport,
and guys were asking me for my ID,

399
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,899
and it occurred to me
that ID is a strange abbreviation,

400
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,694
because "I" is short for "I,"

401
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,028
and then "D"...

402
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,740
is short for "dentification," so...

403
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:00,825
[laughter]

404
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,121
it seems to me
"D" is doing most of the...

405
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:08,416
legwork on that one.

406
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,086
But Vegas was cool.

407
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:14,964
They have a motto in Vegas.

408
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,924
They got their own slogan for the city.

409
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:21,345
It says:
"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."

410
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,930
Which is not true.

411
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,267
You know, you can't kill a guy
and then just leave, you know?

412
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,854
They'll follow you, they'll find you,

413
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,691
they'll bring you back, and they'll
try you in front of a jury of your peers.

414
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:34,775
[laughter]

415
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,904
So I thought, well,
what does it mean, anyways, you know?

416
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,406
And I ruminated about it,

417
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,117
days and days and nights.

418
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,201
[laughter]

419
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,873
Sleepless weeks
became sleepless more weeks.

420
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,501
And, finally, it occurred to me.

421
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:53,878
It was so simple.

422
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,130
It was right in front of my face
the entire time.

423
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,048
"Whatever happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas,"

424
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,676
all it really means
is you can go to Vegas,

425
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,179
you can have sex with a prostitute...

426
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,263
[laughter]

427
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:07,725
and she will not tell your wife.

428
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,809
[laughter]

429
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,481
They're very discreet,

430
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,358
the Las Vegas prostitutes.

431
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,486
You know?

432
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:20,279
Not like these gossipy,

433
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,325
small-town whores
back where you live, you know?

434
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,243
These fucking blabbermouths.

435
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,328
[laughter]

436
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:31,415
Down at the beauty parlor
with that pale blue thing over their head,

437
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,792
whatever the fuck that is.

438
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,043
[laughter]

439
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,878
"Oh, you're Marge Majerson?

440
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,463
You're Neil's wife?

441
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,215
Well, by God!"

442
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,551
"I took a shit on him last night...

443
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,636
[laughter]

444
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,055
in exchange for cash."

445
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:49,683
"Nice fella."

446
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:50,768
[laughter]

447
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,942
My favorite thing
is the magic phones that we all have.

448
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,443
You know,

449
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,404
not so long ago, phones were not magic.

450
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,490
They were just used to telephone people.

451
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,952
And uh... they couldn't take pictures.

452
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,078
You know?

453
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,122
If you wanted to take a picture -
this was only, like, 20 years ago -

454
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,708
you would have to use a...
you couldn't use a phone.

455
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,627
I remember I tried.

456
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,587
"OK, just hold on there. Just..."

457
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:19,839
[laughter]

458
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,216
People go, "What are you doing?"
"Don't worry, it's..."

459
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,887
I was kind of ahead of my time,
but they thought...

460
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:27,972
[laughter]

461
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:35,854
No, you had to use a camera,

462
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,232
and then you would put film in the camera,

463
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,193
and then you would go to a Fotomat.

464
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,278
It was wonderful.

465
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,071
And you would give it to this old man,

466
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:46,574
and he would go behind some beads
and stuff, you know?

467
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,658
[laughter]

468
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,234
And then you go, "When am I going to see
them pictures?" He goes, "I don't know."

469
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,289
And then you go...

470
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,709
"I'll phone you every couple of weeks.
How would that be?"

471
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,793
[laughter]

472
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:03,090
And then, one day,
you got the news your pictures were ready.

473
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,636
And so you brought your whole family,
and you all showed up,

474
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,263
and you got that envelope.

475
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,598
It was wonderful.

476
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:13,267
And you opened that seal, you know,

477
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,395
and then there were the pictures -
a whole handful.

478
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,063
Like, you would go, "Hey, look at this.

479
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:21,191
It's a picture of Aunt Ida,

480
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,777
but her eyes are red like the devil."

481
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:24,862
[laughter]

482
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:29,116
"Maybe Aunt Ida's the devil."

483
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,200
[laughter]

484
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,661
"Hey, look at this!

485
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,330
It's a picture of my dog,

486
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,042
but I put a hat and glasses on it
so it would look like a person."

487
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,211
"It still looks
kind of like a dog a little bit."

488
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,296
[laughter]

489
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,466
"Hey, look, it's a picture of you!

490
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,217
But look at your jacket and your hair!

491
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,510
Ha!"

492
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,595
[laughter]

493
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,431
"Look at the way you used to... Ha!"

494
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,266
"Remember that hair?"

495
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:02,274
So you needed that time for the picture
to make any sense or have any resonance.

496
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,402
Nowadays, you go,

497
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,363
"Hey, would you like to see a picture

498
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,407
of you standing right where you are
one second ago?"

499
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,492
[laughter]

500
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,577
"I got one here."

501
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,331
"Your hair is identical."

502
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,415
[laughter]

503
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,292
"I guess it would be, huh?"

504
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,587
[laughter]

505
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,758
In the real old days,

506
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:29,718
they would take pictures like...

507
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,554
At my house I have a picture
of my great-grandfather,

508
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,014
and I only have one, you know?

509
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:37,434
Back then,
they only had one picture of everybody,

510
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,979
because they would pull that thing,
and it would explode and all that shit.

511
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:42,064
[laughter]

512
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:43,857
And it was just my...

513
00:24:43,941 --> 00:24:45,025
Nobody was happy...

514
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:48,570
because it took so long
to get your picture taken.

515
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,739
So it's just my great-grandfather like...

516
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:51,824
[laughter]

517
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,284
"How long is this going to take, sir?"

518
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,914
"Who's going to feed them hogs?"

519
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,998
[laughter]

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,670
"It damn sure ain't going to be Marjorie,
I'll tell you that."

521
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,754
[laughter]

522
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,887
Do you know what else I like
about the magic phone? Wikipedia.

523
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,849
Oh, have you ever used that?
That's the best, man.

524
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,395
It makes a democracy out of smartness.

525
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,106
Everybody's equal now, you know?

526
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,234
Used to be
a guy would go to school five, six years

527
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,237
and then he would talk to me,
and I would be like, "Uh..."

528
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,321
But now...

529
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,406
[laughter]

530
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,533
Now it's all different...

531
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,162
because I have got my magic phone
in my pocket.

532
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,998
So a guy will say to me -
he'll go, "Hey, Norm,

533
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:45,961
you ever hear of a fella
that went by the name of Claude Monet?"

534
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,045
[laughter]

535
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,508
And I go, "Why, of course I have.

536
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,968
I got to go to the bathroom."

537
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,052
[laughter]

538
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,055
And then I go to the bathroom,

539
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,683
and I'm in there 20-25 minutes,
and I come back.

540
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:00,768
[laughter]

541
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:03,812
I go, "Hey, listen, I was just uh...

542
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,732
We were talking about Claude Monet,
and I just wanted to say

543
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:11,361
that, you know, what I liked about him
was his paintings."

544
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,446
[laughter]

545
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,950
"I like the way he painted.

546
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,744
He was a painter,

547
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:23,207
and I loved how he used the paint
to make paintings."

548
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,291
[laughter]

549
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,296
And then the guy goes, "Goddamn, Norm!"

550
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,382
"I've never been able
to stump you in two years."

551
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,467
[mumbles]

552
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,551
[laughter]

553
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,265
[sighs]

554
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,270
But I looked on my...
Because I like learning on my Wikipedia.

555
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:48,565
And I looked, because I was wondering
about fame, the nature of fame,

556
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,984
because it's changed so much, you know?

557
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,028
And when I was young it was one thing,

558
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,905
and now it's a whole different thing.

559
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:59,743
And uh I was wondering
how many people have been to the moon -

560
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,162
like, have actually walked on the moon.

561
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:05,541
So I looked on my magic telephone
and I found out.

562
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:11,213
Only 14 - 13 or 14 -
in the entire history of the world.

563
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,259
You would think
that would make you very, very famous.

564
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,760
But no.

565
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:17,845
[laughter]

566
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,597
The last guy who walked...

567
00:27:20,681 --> 00:27:24,142
Now, you think he would be famous
for being the last guy to be on the moon.

568
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,061
His name was Harrison Schmitt.

569
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,231
Now, whoever heard of him?

570
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,315
[laughter]

571
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,985
Meanwhile,
he goes all the way to the moon,

572
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,279
hangs around there for a while
and comes back.

573
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,447
He's not famous,

574
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,325
but a girl with a giant ass is famous.

575
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,660
[laughter and applause]

576
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,497
Now, when I was young,

577
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,125
a man who went to the moon was famous,

578
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,127
and a lady with a giant ass, you would go,

579
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,462
"Can you stand over there?
Because this is..."

580
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:53,547
[laughter]

581
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,139
Harrison Schmitt.

582
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:07,311
So how many people that went to the moon
do we even know?

583
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,146
There was... We know the first ones.

584
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,273
There was Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin.

585
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:14,109
They went in Apollo 11 -
Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin.

586
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:17,905
And even the third is hard to remember.
His name is Michael Collins.

587
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,907
And Michael Collins,

588
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,158
in one of the...

589
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:25,329
just most unfair jokes -

590
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,122
I don't know what it was -

591
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,168
he got to go all the way to the moon
but not go on the moon.

592
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,252
[laughter]

593
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,380
[chuckles]

594
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,258
All the way to the moon,

595
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:40,677
and then, that little rope ladder,

596
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,262
he wasn't allowed to go down.

597
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,347
[laughter]

598
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,517
He had to stay in the lunar capsule...

599
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:52,731
while Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong
went on the moon.

600
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,234
Michael Collins
just looking out the window, going...

601
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,154
"Are those motherfuckers golfing?!"

602
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,489
[laughter and applause]

603
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,661
"Good God! They're golfing!"

604
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,998
"Wait a minute, they...
they have got a dune buggy now!"

605
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,083
[laughter]

606
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:16,880
"I was only allowed to bring so much
and they brought dune buggies.

607
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:17,965
This is..."

608
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,134
[grumbles] "I have to keep up
a good face, I guess."

609
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,219
[laughter]

610
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,642
And then Buzz and Neil,
I'm sure they were nice guys,

611
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,144
they didn't want to hurt Michael Collins,
you know?

612
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:35,232
So they probably went back, you know,
to the lunar capsule, you know,

613
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,944
and Michael Collins was like, "What do you
think, guys? What was the moon like?"

614
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,529
And they were like, "Ah."

615
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:41,613
[laughter]

616
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:46,535
"It was all right
if you like that kind of thing, I guess."

617
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,619
[laughter]

618
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,667
"I prefer the lunar capsule myself. I..."

619
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,751
[laughter]

620
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,795
"I can't speak for Buzz, but...

621
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,340
I really do like the lunar capsule."

622
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,595
[chuckles]

623
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:10,350
Because that's what you do.
You know, most of your life is mundane.

624
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:13,895
I decided to write a book, right?
So, it was a book about my life.

625
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,148
They said, "Just write about your life,"
so I said...

626
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,065
[cheering]

627
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,860
Oh, thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

628
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,404
It turned out to be
the greatest comic novel ever written,

629
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:27,993
but when it started
it was supposed to be a memoir, you know?

630
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,704
A... An autobiography.

631
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,790
So it makes you think,
"Well, what is my life?"

632
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,417
So I started thinking about it, right?

633
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,753
So I said, "OK, I wake up in the morning,

634
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,172
and I eat some Count Chocula."

635
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,256
[laughter]

636
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:47,095
And then I watch <i>Sports Center</i>
while I'm digesting my Count Chocula,

637
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,182
and I phone my friend Fat Freddie.

638
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,392
And I go, "Hey.

639
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,937
You want to eat a cheese sandwich
or something around three o'clock?

640
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,900
I... I got to wait
for my Count Chocula to digest,

641
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,235
but how does that settle with you?"

642
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,614
He goes, "Yeah, great,"
so I get together with him.

643
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:09,534
And on my way, I get some groceries
to bring home for later,

644
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,913
and uh... and then, of course,
there's dinner, you know?

645
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,500
So most of my life

646
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,587
is finding and consuming food.

647
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,671
[laughter]

648
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:26,009
So it doesn't make for a riveting read.

649
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,094
[laughter]

650
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,305
[chuckles]

651
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,141
It's incredibly repetitious.

652
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,773
[chuckles]

653
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,691
When you're writing, you learn a lot.

654
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,860
I went to a guy who's a big writer guy.

655
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:46,071
He told me about things
I didn't know about.

656
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,156
Metaphors - have you ever heard of them?

657
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,241
[laughter]

658
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,452
He said, "You have got to use metaphors."
I'm like, "What's that?"

659
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,329
He was like, "That's a thing.

660
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,747
So, a metaphor is like,

661
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,958
'You can lead a horse to water,

662
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,127
but you can't make it drink.'"

663
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,920
I'm like, "What the fuck does that mean?"

664
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,213
So he was like,

665
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,341
"That means you can take a person,
you know,

666
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:09,302
and you can give them
all the information and everything,

667
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:13,640
but he still has to be the one
to absorb it himself."

668
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,685
So I was like, "Well, why the fuck
didn't you just say that? Like, what..."

669
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,768
[laughter]

670
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,356
"Why did you have to put a horse into it?
Like, what..."

671
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,441
[laughter]

672
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:27,195
"You thought I was so stupid you needed
to make it into some fable? Like, what..."

673
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,364
"A horse?"

674
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,955
"Or sometimes
the metaphor part of it is true,

675
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,374
but then the literal part is not true.

676
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:45,005
They will go, like, 'That which does not
kill you makes you stronger, ' right?

677
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,090
Now, metaphorically, that's true,

678
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,926
like maybe a woman
breaks your heart, you know,

679
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,179
or life deals you a bad hand.

680
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,348
And then the next time
you're prepared for it

681
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,934
and uh...
and it doesn't hurt you as much."

682
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,812
"But, literally, it's not true at all.

683
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:05,192
Literally it's, 'That which does not
kill you makes you weaker...

684
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,276
[laughter]

685
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,822
and will probably kill you
the next time it shows up.'"

686
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,539
That's why I like - personally -

687
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:24,878
I like the ones where the metaphor is true
and the literal part is true.

688
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,839
Like... They say, like,
"Beauty is only skin deep."

689
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,008
I think that's beautiful, because it is.

690
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,885
Like, you know, really,

691
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:34,554
what makes a person attractive
is what's inside -

692
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:38,016
their friendship,
their conviviality, their goodwill,

693
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,312
not this uh... optic trick, you know?

694
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,399
And so it has that,
but also, literally it's true,

695
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:50,529
because you could be
the handsomest guy in the world, you know?

696
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,740
You could have, like, this chiseled jaw

697
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:57,244
and beautiful,
thick mane of hair, you know?

698
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,872
Large shoulders and narrow waist.

699
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,123
Are you guys horny?

700
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,416
[laughter]

701
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,668
Is it just me, or...?

702
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,424
Giant quads, a perfect body.

703
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,135
Six percent body fat, you know?

704
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,141
But you take that same guy

705
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,351
and you skin him.

706
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,435
[laughter]

707
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,569
All of a sudden...

708
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,950
he is not so easy on the eye.

709
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,034
[laughter]

710
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,836
[groans]

711
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,254
I'm getting old, you know?

712
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:53,425
I asked my doctor...
This is interesting, because I wondered...

713
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:56,595
You know,
I know the first two causes of death -

714
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,097
heart disease and cancer,

715
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,057
neck and neck, you know, to kill you.

716
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:05,437
So I said to the doctor, "What's
the third most common cause of death?

717
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,646
What is the third?"

718
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,858
And he said, "Complications."

719
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,359
[laughter]

720
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,945
That's...
That's like the doctor fucking up.

721
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,196
Like, how is that the third?

722
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,073
That's the third?

723
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:25,957
You go, "Hey, Doc, I can't help
but noticing my father is dead uh...

724
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,334
[laughter]

725
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:31,171
and I remember yesterday
you said it was a simple operation."

726
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,674
And he was like,
"Yeah, we thought it was."

727
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,719
"Looked simple in the book,
I'll tell you that."

728
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,766
"But uh...
you cut open a man, by God, it's..."

729
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,225
[laughter]

730
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,811
"All this red stringy stuff
and everything."

731
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:49,648
"Are you a doctor?"
"No."

732
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,441
"Ah, you wouldn't have heard.

733
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,318
Way too complicated for you."

734
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,198
But you worry when you get old, you know?

735
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,950
You get concerned, scared.

736
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,371
I remember my grandmother, you know,

737
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,874
she was like... I think she was like 85
at the time or something,

738
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,670
and I looked at her - she was sitting in
her chair - and I said, "Hey, Grandma."

739
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,004
She had a bruise, right?

740
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,173
And it went from her... from her wrist,

741
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,426
all the way up her arm,
right to her shoulder.

742
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,095
A big bruise -

743
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,264
purple, green and yellow.

744
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:24,683
[laughter]

745
00:36:24,766 --> 00:36:26,059
A third of each.

746
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,477
And I said...

747
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,189
I said,
"Grandma, where did you get that bruise?"

748
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:34,067
and then my grandmother said, "The wind."

749
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,151
[laughter]

750
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,072
I said, "The wind?"

751
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,202
And she said, "Yes. Do you remember
that gentle breeze yesterday?"

752
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,286
[laughter]

753
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,747
I was like, "Yeah, I remember."

754
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,130
My parents were teachers,

755
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,882
which is a noble profession,
everyone says.

756
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:58,800
[chuckles]

757
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,718
[laughter]

758
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:02,220
They're fine people.
But do you know what's weird?

759
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,848
They all say,
"Teachers are the real heroes."

760
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,475
My folks - not heroic at all.

761
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,893
[laughter]

762
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,146
And, as a matter of fact,

763
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,316
I have never met a teacher
that showed any heroism.

764
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,609
[laughter]

765
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,319
And I have known a lot of teachers,

766
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:21,364
because I was a student
for years and years.

767
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,449
[laughter]

768
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,702
And never once did I go,
"Hey, Barney, man,

769
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,413
I was just looking at old man Abernathy,

770
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:33,251
you know, at the way he was erasing
that chalk on the chalkboard,

771
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,961
where he put the chalk earlier...

772
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:38,882
and I was thinking,
he cuts a heroic figure, doesn't he?"

773
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,300
[laughter]

774
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,595
"No? Me neither. I didn't think that,
either. I just heard that somewhere."

775
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,557
[chuckles]

776
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:52,061
And it's not that hard a job when you
think about it. You know what I mean?

777
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,107
Like, it's a pretty good...

778
00:37:56,191 --> 00:37:58,318
If you have a job where you go to work -

779
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,361
like Grade 3 - you go to work,

780
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:04,032
and you're 50 times bigger
than everybody else that you work with...

781
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:04,949
[laughter]

782
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,284
that's a pretty good job.

783
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,788
Plus, they do all the work.

784
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:11,247
[laughter]

785
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,791
You do nothing.

786
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,042
That's...

787
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,126
[chuckles]

788
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,337
How about the students?

789
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,422
How about giving some of them
the "heroism"?

790
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,507
You know, the...

791
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,511
five-year-olds that are working for free.

792
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:25,595
[laughter]

793
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:31,226
What do you need, really,
to be a teacher, anyway?

794
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,978
What's the, you know, qualifications?

795
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,397
Let's say you're teaching the Third grade.

796
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:37,690
What... What do you need?

797
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,108
A Fourth-grade education.

798
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:41,986
Really, anything above that...

799
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,363
[laughter]

800
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,615
you're overqualified, really, you know?

801
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:50,995
I didn't like school.

802
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,415
I liked before school.

803
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:56,000
Man, do you remember that?

804
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:57,627
Before you had to go to school.

805
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,380
Man, that was the greatest time ever.
I'll never forget it.

806
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:02,882
Those were my finest days, man.

807
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,467
I loved them so much.

808
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:07,136
I remember, like,
I would go over to Shawn Kay's house,

809
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,555
and I would have a stick,

810
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,181
and that would be the whole day.

811
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,599
[laughter]

812
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,270
I would go, "Shawn, I've got a stick!"
He would go, "Goddamn! We'll go play."

813
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,354
[laughter]

814
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,356
It was so much fun.

815
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,359
And then, one day, suddenly I'm in school.

816
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,946
They were dragging me in,
and I remember there were tears and...

817
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,865
I'm like, "What the fuck?"

818
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,869
There were these windows
that made it even...

819
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,495
You would look out the window

820
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,164
and sometimes
you would see the stick, you know?

821
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,374
[laughter]

822
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,584
And you would go, "Goddamn!

823
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,962
Do these people's cruelty
know no offense?"

824
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,804
Nowadays, you know,
they have the ADD and stuff like that.

825
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,765
For kids in class who are like,
"Hey, I would like to go out!"

826
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:54,517
they go, "We're going to drug you."

827
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:55,602
[laughter]

828
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,355
"Then you won't want to get out...

829
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,484
and run around in the grass
and have fun with the stick."

830
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:04,569
[laughter]

831
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:06,905
"You'll be fine. You'll be good."

832
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,911
But, anyways, I'm old now, you know?

833
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,037
I was young.

834
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,121
[laughter]

835
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,915
Now I am old.

836
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,250
[inhales deeply]

837
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,335
Yeah.

838
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,419
[laughter]

839
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,880
I learned some things in school.

840
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,341
Now that I'm old,
things scare me, you know?

841
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,134
I think it's the media that does it.

842
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:32,055
Like, they go, "North Korea," you know?
And, I don't know, it kind of scares...

843
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:35,767
It doesn't scare me that much,
but... it's supposed to scare you.

844
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,477
But, like, are you really scared?

845
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,229
Have you ever woken up, gone, "Ah!"
and your wife says, "What?!"

846
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:41,314
"North Korea!"

847
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:42,398
[laughter]

848
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,735
That little, tiny country,
way the fuck over somewhere.

849
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,281
"I'm scared, honey. I'm scared."

850
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:53,368
[chuckles]

851
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:54,953
I'll tell you,

852
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:58,122
Iraq doesn't scare me, North Korea -
none of those countries scare me.

853
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:02,835
There's only one country, really,
that scares me in the whole country.

854
00:41:02,919 --> 00:41:04,045
Or in the whole...

855
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,340
What do you call that's bigger than
a country but less than a galaxy?

856
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,424
[laughter]

857
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:10,218
Earth.

858
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,680
The entire earth, there's only one country
that frightens me -

859
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,264
that's the country of Germany.

860
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,768
I don't know if you guys
are students of history or not, but...

861
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,852
[laughter]

862
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,816
for those of you who aren't,

863
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,567
Germany,

864
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,946
in the previous century -
in the early part...

865
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,782
they decided to go to war.

866
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,909
And who did they choose to go to war with?

867
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:36,327
The world.

868
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:37,412
[laughter]

869
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,210
So you think
that would last about five seconds

870
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,796
and the world would fucking win,
and that would be that.

871
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:47,880
[laughter]

872
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:49,507
But it was actually close.

873
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,591
And then...

874
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,052
I don't know how that worked, but...

875
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,557
Then 30 years pass,

876
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,018
and Germany decides to go to war again.

877
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:02,562
And, once again,
they choose as their foe...

878
00:42:04,397 --> 00:42:05,397
the world!

879
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,441
And now...

880
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,569
this time, they really almost win.

881
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:10,903
[laughter]

882
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,072
So at this point
you would think the world would go,

883
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,200
"Germany, you're fucking not a country
any more, all right?"

884
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,285
[laughter]

885
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,369
"What the fuck?"

886
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,667
"You're not a country because you keep
going to war with the world,

887
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,878
and... no one does...

888
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,671
What do you think you are, Mars?"

889
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:29,756
[laughter]

890
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,051
"Do you think you're Mars or something?"

891
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:34,135
[laughter]

892
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:39,140
[chuckles]

893
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,226
But it's fun to get old, you know?

894
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,314
You start watching old things.

895
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,069
You know those commercials
that are toward old people?

896
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:54,322
I was watching, for instance, on MeTV,
I was watching uh...

897
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,908
<i>The Six Million Dollar Man,</i> right?

898
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,870
And he was in Paris, jumping over the
Arc de Triomphe and everything like that.

899
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,957
And then, just by luck or coincidence,

900
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,667
they went to a commercial,

901
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:10,922
and it was a commercial
starring Lee Majors,

902
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,715
the Six Million Dollar Man,

903
00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:15,510
but as he is today, like an old man.

904
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:19,680
So he's jumping over...
And it was for the bionic ear.

905
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,057
[laughter]

906
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,727
And it wasn't the real bionic ear
from the show,

907
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:26,395
it was a fucking hearing aid.

908
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:27,480
[laughter]

909
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:32,568
So you see him jumping over
the Arc de Triomphe,

910
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,821
and then it cuts,
and he's in a studio, like,

911
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,531
"I can't hear too good out of..."

912
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,615
[laughter]

913
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,201
"This one's no good at all.

914
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,536
This one's all right."

915
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,620
[laughter]

916
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,582
"This one may as well not even be an ear."

917
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:47,917
[laughter]

918
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,252
And you go, "Goddamn."

919
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,255
You can't help but feel sorry
for a man like that.

920
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:57,426
Because you know, at one time, he got
a phone call from his agent, you know?

921
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,929
And he probably had
all kinds of hope, you know?

922
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:04,225
He answers, "Hey, Jerome! My God!
I haven't heard from you in 30 years."

923
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,393
[chuckles]

924
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,728
"You've got something for me?
Well, let me guess.

925
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,647
I bet I know what it is.

926
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:11,190
It's that movie I wrote:

927
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,193
<i>The Return
Of The Six Million Dollar Man...</i>

928
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,196
starring Ben Stiller.

929
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,491
And then I show up
as a judge for two minutes."

930
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:21,868
[laughter]

931
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:22,952
"Is that the one?"

932
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,663
"No? What is it, then?"

933
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,456
"It's a...

934
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,125
No, not out of this one. No."

935
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,209
[laughter]

936
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,129
"Well, what..."

937
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,381
"What is that?"

938
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,425
"That's a hearing aid?"

939
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:40,761
"Well...

940
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,891
how much does something like that
pay a fellow?"

941
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,476
[chuckles]

942
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,520
"It's funny you say that, Jerome,

943
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,938
because when you say it,

944
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:55,860
I realize that that's only one tenth

945
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,655
of what I used to get
from a single episode of...

946
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,824
No, I'll keep... I won't... Sorry."

947
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:02,909
[laughter]

948
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,077
"Um...

949
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,746
When do they have to know by?"

950
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,165
"Oh, within the hour, huh?"

951
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,792
"Well uh...

952
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,921
I guess, then, I would say um...
[clears throat]

953
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,297
yes, I'll take that."

954
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,381
[laughter]

955
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,385
"Jerome, I have to ask you this.

956
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,471
Is there any way in the contract

957
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,182
that you can put in that um...

958
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,060
I'm sad?"

959
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,144
[laughter]

960
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,108
[laughter continues]

961
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,251
What about those commercials... [coughs]

962
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,504
where the guy
just tells you stuff you already know?

963
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,422
There's this one with William Devane,

964
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,299
and he goes, "Do you like gold?"

965
00:46:00,383 --> 00:46:01,884
You're like, "Yes, of course."

966
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:02,969
[laughter]

967
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,682
"You should buy a big bar of gold
and put it in your safe."

968
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:10,101
You go, "Well, I wish I could.
That would be very nice."

969
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,185
[laughter]

970
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,146
"Do you know gold's always been valuable?"

971
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,482
"Yes, I know everything
you're telling me."

972
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,984
[laughter]

973
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,736
"Daffy Duck told me that
when I was a little kid.

974
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,322
I know all about how gold is valuable."

975
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,497
There's one that I don't understand,
but it's kind of...

976
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,666
It's called "reverse mortgage."

977
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,042
[laughter]

978
00:46:35,126 --> 00:46:36,877
I had never heard of one of these things.

979
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,296
It has a guy on it, and he goes,

980
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,798
"I'm a guy...

981
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,882
[laughter]

982
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,886
and I want to tell you about
reverse mortgages.

983
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,932
You've probably never heard of them,
but you all know what a mortgage is."

984
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:53,769
"That's when you and your loved one,

985
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,771
you get together a grubstake -

986
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,898
you know, a little bit of money -

987
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:03,029
and, by God, you put it down
on a piece of land or a house, you know?

988
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:07,783
And then, every month, you pay
what's called a mortgage, you know?

989
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,952
Which is some money to the bank.

990
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:12,163
And then 20 years pass, or 30,

991
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,291
and you have a big party
with your friends.

992
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,668
All your kith and kin come,

993
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,587
and you burn the mortgage,

994
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,963
and, by God,

995
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:25,426
you own a piece of the American dream."

996
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,512
"Anyway, this is the complete opposite."

997
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:29,597
[laughter]

998
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:32,767
"So uh...

999
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,520
we would be glad
to send you some brochures.

1000
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:37,605
It's uh..."

1001
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,689
[laughter]

1002
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,943
"It's a picture of you with no shelter."

1003
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,028
[laughter]

1004
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,997
[sighs]

1005
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,920
You know,
I'm trying to be a better person.

1006
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,630
I don't know if you're religious or not.

1007
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,298
I'm sort of half religious, half not.

1008
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,674
I try to uh...

1009
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,052
obey the commandments.

1010
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:11,889
And it's funny that some of the
commandments are very easy to obey,

1011
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,390
and some are very difficult.

1012
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:16,685
You know what I'm saying?
Like, "Thou shalt not kill."

1013
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,314
Well, it's pretty easy
to obey that, you know?

1014
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,150
But then there's other ones
that are really hard to obey,

1015
00:48:23,234 --> 00:48:24,568
like there's one that says,

1016
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:29,406
"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's ox."

1017
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,491
[laughter]

1018
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,911
Now...

1019
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,998
I have this old scraggly fucking ox.

1020
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,083
[laughter]

1021
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,631
I bought him used -
that was my first mistake.

1022
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,007
[laughter]

1023
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,135
And uh... the guy who sold it to me

1024
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:52,429
didn't tell me about
all the fucking diseases this thing has.

1025
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,015
So he fucking wanders around.

1026
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,143
He can't pull anything.

1027
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:02,398
And he has a big thing around his neck,

1028
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,692
like a bell, and that causes him...

1029
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,987
neck problems, so I have to take that off.

1030
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,071
And then...

1031
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,324
Then I walk past my neighbor's house,

1032
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:14,285
and I look in his garage,

1033
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:18,747
and here stands the most beautiful...

1034
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,962
like, blue-grey...

1035
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,591
Belgian ox...

1036
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,469
that I've ever laid eyes upon.

1037
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:35,472
And he's brushing his lustrous...

1038
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,144
And I'm not supposed to covet it? I...

1039
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,228
[laughter]

1040
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,861
"Thou shalt not bear false witness."

1041
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,029
That's a tough one.

1042
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,780
But it's good, you know, not to lie,

1043
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:54,491
but it's very, very hard, you know,

1044
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:57,786
not lying,
because you want people to like you and...

1045
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,913
Do know what I mean?

1046
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:00,873
You want to...

1047
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,376
All kinds of reasons to lie.

1048
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,213
I thought of a way of not lying,

1049
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:09,548
and I'll...
I'll share it with you, if you like?

1050
00:50:10,341 --> 00:50:13,928
You can tell the truth, word for word,

1051
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,513
absolutely true, but when you do it...

1052
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:17,514
[clears throat]

1053
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,601
you use a sarcastic accent.

1054
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,685
[laughter]

1055
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,605
So I'll give you an example.

1056
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:28,651
Your wife goes, "Hey, I noticed at dinner
you were looking at my sister.

1057
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:31,904
You're... You're not attracted
to my sister, are you?"

1058
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,197
And then you go,

1059
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,991
"Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you,

1060
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,327
I'm attracted to your sister."

1061
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,411
[laughter]

1062
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,250
She's like,
"All right, Henry. Never mind."

1063
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,334
[laughter]

1064
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,922
You go, "No. Why? It's true.
I want to fuck her. I..."

1065
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,006
[laughter]

1066
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,678
"Hey, the only reason I married you
is to fuck your sister, right?"

1067
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:59,390
She's like,
"No, I shouldn't have brought it up."

1068
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,268
"No! Why wouldn't you bring it up?

1069
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,603
I mean,
you're the victim in this whole thing."

1070
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:05,688
[laughter]

1071
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:10,651
"I remember at the vows, I kept thinking,

1072
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,946
I am going to seduce

1073
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:18,033
every member of my wife's family."

1074
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:19,118
[laughter]

1075
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,911
"Regardless of gender,

1076
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:22,997
I'm going to fuck all of them."

1077
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,332
"Then, afterwards,

1078
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,543
I'm going to invite them over to the house

1079
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,421
and set it on fire, killing them all."

1080
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,504
[laughter]

1081
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:37,219
"And then I'm going to move on
to the next town, where I do it again."

1082
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,429
[laughter]

1083
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,765
It's like, "All right, Henry.
We don't need to hear it."

1084
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,893
"You don't have to be like this."

1085
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,563
"Why? Why?"

1086
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,690
[stammers]

1087
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,774
[laughter]

1088
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:56,864
"You're the good person in this scenario."

1089
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:03,162
"I'm the guy
that goes from town to town...

1090
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,416
fucking and murdering entire families...

1091
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:08,667
[laughter]

1092
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:13,672
and leaving conflagrations of ashes
that used to be human beings."

1093
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:20,679
"I'm the most savage

1094
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:24,391
and prolific serial killer
that ever was...

1095
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,436
and I've just never been found out yet,

1096
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,604
that's all."

1097
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,688
[laughter]

1098
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,108
"Just go to sleep."

1099
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:36,236
"Yeah, I'll go to sleep,

1100
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,031
or maybe I'll buy kerosene all night."

1101
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,115
[laughter]

1102
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,455
So, that's just an example.

1103
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,082
You don't have to do that one.

1104
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,166
[laughter]

1105
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:51,210
I'm just...

1106
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:53,212
I'm just saying, that's all.

1107
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,341
But, listen, there's important things
going on in the world,

1108
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:58,967
it's raining in the forest.

1109
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,094
[laughter]

1110
00:53:01,762 --> 00:53:03,806
I don't want to get
too political with you,

1111
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,016
but it's a true fact.

1112
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,398
Now, I know...

1113
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:15,651
You know, I know uh... science,

1114
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:21,156
and I would not be surprised at all if,
like, ten years from now, scientists went,

1115
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,868
"Goddamn! It's good we burned down
that motherfucking rainforest."

1116
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:25,953
[laughter]

1117
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:30,374
"It turned out that's where all
the spiders and snakes lived and shit."

1118
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:31,458
[laughter]

1119
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:36,797
"It's what started that snake flu
that nearly took everybody out."

1120
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,635
[chuckles] Nobody knows nothing.

1121
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,935
But, you know,
you're supposed to crunch up cans,

1122
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,020
and I think it's a good thing, you know?

1123
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,482
You've got the orange
and then the green, there's blue.

1124
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:58,861
You crunch the cans, and then you
put that... And you should do that.

1125
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,571
I'm not doing it, but you guys...

1126
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,655
[laughter]

1127
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,576
should do it,
because it's important, you know?

1128
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,912
It's always supposed to be
for the people from the future.

1129
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,039
That's how they try to trick you,
you know?

1130
00:54:11,123 --> 00:54:14,042
They always go,
"The children are the future,"

1131
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:18,005
which is true,
but they said that when I was a child.

1132
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:22,694
Then I grew up. I was like, "Here I am!"
They were like, "Now it's the other kids."

1133
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:24,136
I go, "You fucker."

1134
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,053
[laughter]

1135
00:54:25,137 --> 00:54:27,431
"I had a feeling
there was something here."

1136
00:54:29,725 --> 00:54:32,311
"I know a Ponzi scheme when I see one."

1137
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,395
[laughter]

1138
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,026
"And now it's the other children."

1139
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,111
[cheering and applause

1140
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:50,245
Listen, this has all been wonderful.

1141
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:52,831
But I will tell you this.

1142
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,168
Nothing I have said, really,
is of substance.

1143
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,461
I-I find...

1144
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:58,545
[laughter]

1145
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:02,090
And it's not just me.

1146
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,175
I find...

1147
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:07,054
Like, most of my act is just,

1148
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,138
you know...

1149
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,223
uh...

1150
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,850
gossip and... and trickery.

1151
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:12,935
[laughter]

1152
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:16,605
Do you know what I mean?
Like some cheap magician, you know?

1153
00:55:19,566 --> 00:55:22,027
So, I'll tell you the only thing
I know for a fact,

1154
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,862
and it's something that we all know.

1155
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,322
Everybody knows it,

1156
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,950
but it's harder to act on it, it is.

1157
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,703
But the only really true thing

1158
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,413
is that...

1159
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:38,126
we all must love each other.

1160
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:39,503
[cheering and applause]

1161
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,715
And it's very difficult, you know?

1162
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,425
It's very, very hard.

1163
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,803
Hey, what about this?

1164
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:49,846
A dog loves people.

1165
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,559
Like, you think it's hard to love people -
a dog loves everybody.

1166
00:55:53,642 --> 00:55:54,977
Like, a dog...

1167
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:58,063
Like, my dog, right,

1168
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,481
I've never seen such a...

1169
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:00,566
No judgement.

1170
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,776
Like, my dog, all he does is love me.

1171
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:03,860
When I wake up...

1172
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:05,445
I think he watches me sleeping,

1173
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,531
because when I wake up, he's right there,

1174
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,991
and he's like, "I love you!"

1175
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,243
He jumps up. He's licking my face.

1176
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,996
"I love you more than anything!
You're the greatest!"

1177
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,623
I go, "Thanks.
You're cool, too. I love you."

1178
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:19,167
"I love you more than anything!"
"I love you, too."

1179
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:21,169
"Remember yesterday
when you threw that bone

1180
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,813
and it turned out to be a rubber bone?"

1181
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,674
"Yeah, it was a joke.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."

1182
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,677
"I wasn't! I wasn't!
I was laughing. It was funny."

1183
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:31,888
"Oh, you love me so much, and I love you.

1184
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:33,348
This is the greatest thing.

1185
00:56:33,432 --> 00:56:35,767
I'm just going to kiss you
and kiss you forever."

1186
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,562
I go, "Yes, you can do that."
"I'm just going to keep kissing you."

1187
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,856
Then I go, "OK,
get the fuck away from me, all right?!"

1188
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,232
[laughter]

1189
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,942
"Just leave me alone, would you?"

1190
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:49,406
"I've got to write shit
into a magic phone and stuff.

1191
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:51,199
I've got no time for this...

1192
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,619
fucking dog stuff."

1193
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,957
Then my dog goes, "You're right."

1194
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,042
[laughter]

1195
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,504
"I find... You know, I love you,

1196
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,758
but I... I just push too hard."

1197
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,842
[laughter]

1198
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,012
"I push and I push and I push,

1199
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,597
and I push you away."

1200
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:17,976
"I'm no good."

1201
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,520
"I'm no damn good."

1202
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:21,605
[laughter]

1203
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,319
"But what say...

1204
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:31,156
what say I just stood here

1205
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,658
and stared at you...

1206
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:33,742
[laughter]

1207
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,162
completely quietly...

1208
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:40,457
until, finally, you looked at me again...

1209
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,250
with some look of love,

1210
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,252
and then I jump up and love you again?"

1211
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:45,837
[laughter and applause]

1212
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:49,007
And you go, "Yes, that would be fine."

1213
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,301
"Do that."

1214
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,386
[laughter]

1215
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,849
They don't judge, dogs.

1216
00:57:57,933 --> 00:58:01,937
We judge, you know?
All our love comes with caveats, you know?

1217
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,983
There's no such thing
as unconditional love with human beings.

1218
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,110
But dogs, they don't care.

1219
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,194
They love...

1220
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,238
Hitler had a dog. Now, you think of that.

1221
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,322
[laughter]

1222
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,367
I'm no fan of Hitler.

1223
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,451
[laughter]

1224
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,078
I never liked him.

1225
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:23,625
I didn't like him
before it was cool not to like him.

1226
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:24,710
[laughter]

1227
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:31,675
But there was a dog in history
who loved Hitler more than anyone.

1228
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,593
He would wake up in the morning and go,

1229
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:34,761
"Where's Hitler?!"

1230
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:35,846
You know?

1231
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,139
[laughter]

1232
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:39,266
And Göring, or somebody, would go,

1233
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,643
"He's not here.
He's doing some evil stuff."

1234
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,061
[laughter]

1235
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:46,023
"I've explained to you, he spends
most of his time doing evil stuff.

1236
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,691
You can't see him that often."

1237
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,151
He goes, "OK. Yeah, I know.

1238
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:52,696
I'm not trying to...
Listen, Göring, I love you, you know?

1239
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:56,283
I love Mengele, I love everybody.
All you guys are the greatest.

1240
00:58:56,366 --> 00:59:00,620
But it's just Hitler
is the greatest man who's ever lived."

1241
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:01,705
[laughter]

1242
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:14,384
This is why we ask
that you don't use recording devices.

1243
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,719
[laughter and applause]

1244
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:19,973
[cheering]

1245
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,521
Just...

1246
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:30,317
I don't want to be with fucking
Harvey Levin tomorrow or something.

1247
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,401
[laughter]

1248
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:36,656
"Did you say Hitler was the greatest?"
And what would be my fucking answer?

1249
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,575
I would go, "No, it was a dog."

1250
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:39,659
[laughter]

1251
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:43,163
That wouldn't work. I would be fucked.

1252
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,706
[laughter]

1253
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,001
But...

1254
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:54,174
I'll be goddamned if I'm going
to end a special talking about Hitler.

1255
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,675
[laughter and cheering]

1256
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:56,760
[applause]

1257
00:59:58,929 --> 01:00:00,972
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do -

1258
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,390
end a special...

1259
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:07,145
I'm going to call my special <i>Hitler's Dog.</i>

1260
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,230
[laughter]
