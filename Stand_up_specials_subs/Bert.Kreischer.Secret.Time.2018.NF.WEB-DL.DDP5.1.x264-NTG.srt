1
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,844
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...</i>

2
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>Bert Kreischer.</i>

3
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,965
Oh.

4
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,425
Yes.

5
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,179
Yeah, lower your expectations, Philly.

6
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,516
We're just getting drunk
and telling secrets.

7
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:02,187
Secret time.

8
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,148
When I get out of the shower,

9
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,068
I dry my asshole on the bed.
Bam! Secret time.

10
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:14,199
Sometimes when I wipe my ass,
I spit on the toilet paper.

11
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,743
It's called an Alabama Wet Wipe.
Secret time.

12
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,586
When my wife has an orgasm,
she looks like Elvis.

13
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,800
Secret time.

14
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,804
I love my wife. Er...

15
00:01:38,557 --> 00:01:40,642
Sometimes, when my wife's blowing me,

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,396
I feel like she's gagging
for the wrong reason.

17
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,822
Down there trying to hold it together

18
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,074
like a rookie in a hot dog eating contest.

19
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,541
Staring into my belly
like a woman lost in the desert, just...

20
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,799
Listening to me going in and out
of sleep apnea through it.

21
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,968
Slower.

22
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,553
Slower.

23
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,682
I'm really big, huh?

24
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,521
She's a good mom.

25
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,527
Couldn't give a hand job to save her life.

26
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,905
Seriously,
if someone broke into our house,

27
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,907
lined up our family on the couch,
he's like,

28
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,451
"I'm gonna kill
every motherfucker in here

29
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:43,246
unless one of you can give me
a semi tolerable...

30
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:49,294
Like on a scale of one to ten,
like a three kind of earthy hand job..."

31
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,588
I'd still be like, "Honey, I got this.

32
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,554
Stop crying, girls.
We're gonna be just fine.

33
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,600
Keep your hands
in your pocket, LeeAnn."

34
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:15,070
Last hand job I got from her,
October 7th 2017.

35
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,906
I remember it. I was sober that month.

36
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,161
Getting a sober hand job is a lot like
getting molested at camp.

37
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,581
I wanted to have sex.

38
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,419
I started to go, "Let's bang one out,"
she's like, "I don't want to have sex."

39
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,963
I was like, "All right,
I'll just take a blow job."

40
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,048
Apparently that's an upsell.

41
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,637
I didn't realize that, "Oh, you don't like
the Volkswagen, try the BMW."

42
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,101
So we settled on a Kia.
That's a hand job in the afternoon.

43
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,979
The second it started,

44
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,356
I was like,
"I immediately regret this decision."

45
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,735
Sun is filling the room.

46
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,445
I'm laying on the bed.

47
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,864
She's sitting next to me,
criss cross applesauce,

48
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,076
fully dressed, with a smile,
like it's her first time rolling dice.

49
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,877
I'm like, "Stop staring at me."

50
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,378
She's like, "Huh?"

51
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,257
I go, "We're making eye contact.
You're staring into my soul. It hurts."

52
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,551
She's like, "What should I look at?
At it?"

53
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,139
I go, "Dab for all I fucking care."

54
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,268
She is a good mom. I'm a shit dad.

55
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,564
I don't hit 'em,
you know, and stuff but...

56
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,651
I'm a shit dad.

57
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,279
Do you remember when you were a kid,

58
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,365
and you'd hear your parents talking
about really bad parents,

59
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,742
like, "Oh, my gosh.

60
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,078
Amy Stevens' mom was drunk
dropping her off at school the other day,"

61
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,664
and you were like,
"How does that happen?"

62
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,793
Then you become a parent,
you're like, "I know how that happens."

63
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,754
I've definitely been there.

64
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,842
Stop drinking at three,
wake up at seven for drop-off.

65
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,928
Get in the car, you're like, "Whoa...

66
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,640
Who wants to take Uber today, huh?

67
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,977
We can get donuts
if we don't tell Mom about it."

68
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,481
This is how bad of a parent I am.

69
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:19,277
I went to a parent-teacher conference,
stayed out until four in the morning.

70
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,863
Conference starts at 7:30 in the morning.

71
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,490
I wake up, I'm like, "Oh, fuck."

72
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:25,992
I make a cup of coffee,
I grab two Diet Cokes,

73
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,452
go to the conference,

74
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,746
kill the coffee
before the conference even starts,

75
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:31,915
sit down for the conference,
crack my Diet Coke,

76
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,960
take a sip,
and realize I have a Coors Light.

77
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,678
That is a game-time decision, gentlemen.

78
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,890
The second I felt the beer
touch my tongue...

79
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,727
That's like a finger in your ass
in an orgy.

80
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,856
What kind of man are you?

81
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,400
Do you pull away from it
or do you push back into it?

82
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,864
Yeah, I pushed back into it
and I killed that fucking Coors Light.

83
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,085
Reached into my pocket
and prayed I had another Coors Light.

84
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,672
Who the fuck wants a Diet Coke
if you just had a Coors Light?

85
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,341
I don't hit 'em.

86
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,512
That's the only thing I can say.
We live in LA.

87
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:31,266
So when they misbehave, we put them
in the corner and urinate on them.

88
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:34,561
Just kidding. Someone's gonna take that
fucking for real.

89
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,314
They're like, "You really piss
on your fucking kids?"

90
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,065
I don't hit 'em.

91
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,567
I got hit. Not a lot.

92
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,195
I got spanked a couple times
and all I know is you do not want...

93
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,448
Man, spanking sucks.
You grew up in Philly.

94
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,866
You know. You still get hit.

95
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,541
I remember the first time
I ever got spanked.

96
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,085
My sister's fourth birthday party.
I was six.

97
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,880
They're singing "Happy Birthday,"
she goes to blow out the candles,

98
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,466
and I'm like, "And kiss the cake! Boom!"

99
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,344
Dude, it killed so hard.

100
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,554
The clown was laughing.

101
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,765
He was like, "Doh, this kid's got chops."

102
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,478
It killed so hard that my dad's like,
"Yo, I gotta talk to you in the garage."

103
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:19,397
I was like, "If you're gonna high-five me,
we should probably do it out there.

104
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,108
She's a little worked up."

105
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,528
We get into the garage,
he's like, "Pull your pants down."

106
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,781
I was like, "Hold on,
slow down for a second.

107
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,991
We both agreed this was funny,

108
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:31,993
but I wouldn't
go sucking my dick over it."

109
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,209
And then he spanked me.

110
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,088
Spanked me, and then said,
"Pull your pants up. Let's go back in."

111
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,507
I was like,
"I don't feel like partying anymore."

112
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:53,848
He never got my personality.
Still doesn't get my personality.

113
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,433
Like even today as men,

114
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,103
I called him up the other morning,
early in the morning LA time.

115
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,772
He's in Florida. He goes,
"What are you doing awake?"

116
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,149
I said,
"I had a bad dream."

117
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,403
It's silent, and he just goes,
"Whoa, you still dream?"

118
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,240
I go, "Yeah, I dream. You don't dream?"

119
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,701
He goes, "No, I don't dream.
I'm a fucking man!

120
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,788
I go to sleep,
'cause I'm tired from working all day,

121
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,999
and I sleep,
'cause I have to work the next day.

122
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,875
What are you dreaming about?
Ponies and shit?"

123
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,461
I was like, "Yeah, sometimes."

124
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,464
He goes, "I'd love to have your job.

125
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,300
All you gotta do is get drunk
and fucking tell secrets.

126
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,471
Secret time! My dad hit me
when I was a kid. Secret time.

127
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,764
Secret time:

128
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,225
one time, my dad shit his pants
at a Banana Republic."

129
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,185
That's true. That's actually true.

130
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,229
A hundred percent true, swear to God.

131
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,108
The day after Thanksgiving. Black Friday.
Or Brown Friday, as we call it.

132
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,450
We go to Banana Republic.
I grab a sweater and a jacket.

133
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,994
The sweater's for him.
I get in line and go, "Yo, watch my kids."

134
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,996
"All right," then he comes back
without my kids.

135
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,998
"Where are my kids?"
He's like, "Fuck your kids.

136
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:00,999
We got a problem."

137
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,169
I was like, "What?"

138
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,504
He goes, "I think I'm gonna shit my pants.
What do I do?"

139
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,716
I was like, "Stop making eye contact
with me, stranger."

140
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,761
And then he shit his pants.

141
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,764
And I saw it happen in his eyes.

142
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,516
Just,
"Oh! I shit my pants!"

143
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,313
He makes a beeline out of B-Reps,

144
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,316
my mom and my wife come up
and they're like, "Where is Dad?"

145
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,026
I was like, "Dad just shit his pants."

146
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,404
My mom jumped on it like a soldier.
She was like,

147
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,491
"Someone get him a new pair
of khakis. 38/30. I'll go find him."

148
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,327
I was like, "Does this happen a lot?"

149
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,581
He does not find me funny.

150
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,793
I've only made him laugh one time.

151
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,587
One time seven Christmases ago.

152
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,966
I was in D.C. I call my wife up and go,
"Yo, what do you want for Christmas?"

153
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,927
My wife's like, "Pajamas."

154
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,387
Pajamas.

155
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:02,185
She meant <i>pajamas.</i> I heard pajamas.

156
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,731
She meant a pair of pajamas.
Start there, Bert.

157
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:10,276
I heard the plural,
so I bought her seven pairs of pajamas...

158
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,280
...and individually wrapped them,
she had a lot of shit to open.

159
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,992
And I sat back going, "Done, son!

160
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,955
Bitch wants pajamas, bitch got pajamas!"

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,002
All Christmas,
I'm like, "Yo, open my gift!"

162
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,547
She's like, "I'll get to it.
I'm working with the girls."

163
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,758
My dad sitting next to me like,
"You must've killed it this year, buddy."

164
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,552
I was like, "You'll see."

165
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,099
Finally...

166
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,018
end of Christmas, she gets to my present.

167
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,230
I've been talking about this present
all Christmas.

168
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,192
Whole family gathers around.

169
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,695
She opens the first pair.

170
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:57,073
Pulls them out and just goes,
"Oh, pajamas."

171
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,163
And immediately, I think, "Fuck."

172
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,668
If that's her reaction
to pajamas number one...

173
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,380
I can't imagine it's going to build.

174
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,551
My dad's drinking whiskey and eggnog,

175
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,761
and just goes, "Who the fuck
buys someone pajamas?"

176
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,807
She opens the second pair,
pulls them out,

177
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,685
and goes, "Oh. More pajamas."

178
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,647
My dad looks at the five unwrapped gifts,
quickly does the math,

179
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,357
and goes, "You're a fucking idiot."

180
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,655
By pajamas number five,

181
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:39,115
he's going Flipper on me, just...

182
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,872
Pajama number six,
the whole family's around her,

183
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,958
going, "Come on, pajamas!"

184
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,713
Pajamas number seven,
they are <i>pissing themselves,</i>

185
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,634
thinking, "How could this get funnier?"
What they do not know is,

186
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,928
I've also bought my mom
and sisters pajamas.

187
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:04,933
You should have seen this man when my mom
pulled her gift out from me,

188
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,769
and he was like,
"Oh, it's motherfucking pajamas!"

189
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,654
I have made this man so angry in life.

190
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,365
One time...

191
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,952
whole family was driving
from Tampa to Philadelphia.

192
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,955
Like, I'm ten years old,
or whenever spitballs were big.

193
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,458
I'm sitting in the back
of the station wagon,

194
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,543
and I have a brilliant idea.

195
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,295
I go, "I wonder...

196
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,090
if I could shoot a spitball
from where I'm sitting

197
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,968
to the inside of his glasses...

198
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,305
...while he's driving 80 miles per hour...

199
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,809
I bet he'll appreciate
how good my aim is."

200
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,937
I'm like, "Yeah, this is a great idea."

201
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,982
I line it up, I take the shot...

202
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,693
...and I miss entirely.

203
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,154
And instead of going
on the inside of his glasses,

204
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,032
it goes directly in his ear canal.

205
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,035
And he goes full JFK,

206
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:08,705
just,
"Son of a fucking bitch!

207
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,456
Oh, God!"

208
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,208
My mom's like, "What's going on?"

209
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,919
He's like, "Something entered my head! Oh!

210
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,005
I think I'm having a stroke, Maggie!"

211
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,466
Pulls the car over,

212
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,720
fishes it out,
and is like, "How the fuck...

213
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,473
would a piece of paper
get in my fucking ear?

214
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,476
Is there a window?" Turns around,

215
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,980
I'm so shocked I missed, I still
have the straw in my mouth, like...

216
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,031
He goes, "Did you do this?"

217
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,868
"I was trying to get it
on the inside of your glasses."

218
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,912
He's like, "Why?"

219
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,623
"Wanted to show you how good my aim is."

220
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,419
He looks at me
without breaking a smile and goes,

221
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,339
"Hey, buddy, your aim fucking sucks."

222
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,389
One time, I'm like five years old.

223
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm eating breakfast in his bed,
and I finished my milk.

224
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,811
I look at him and go,
"Hey, big guy, refill on the milk."

225
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,357
He rolls his eyes...

226
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,735
goes in the refrigerator,
pulls out some milk,

227
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,071
comes into his bedroom,
leans over his bed starts to pour,

228
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,739
and I go, "Hey!"

229
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:30,370
And he pours milk on his bed, and goes,
"Why the fuck would you do that?"

230
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,791
I looked at him and I go, "It's comedy."

231
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,758
He told me I should start hitting my kids.

232
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,844
Yeah, my kids are dumb as fuck.

233
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,347
I love them. They're my children.

234
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,810
I love them with all my heart,
but man, they are legit mouth-breathers.

235
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,398
Two very different types of stupid.

236
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,484
My oldest just found out
there's no Santa Claus.

237
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,320
Yeah, she's 13.

238
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,156
To put that in perspective,

239
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,368
kids in her class are finger fucking
and hitting vape pens.

240
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:17,375
She's leaving out milk and cookies,
clicking her heels together.

241
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,548
She asked me about Santa
this last Christmas, and I panicked.

242
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:28,136
Because I believe, and I could be wrong,
but I believe there's a correlation

243
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,515
in when you stop believing in Santa
and when you start sucking dicks.

244
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,521
No? No.

245
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,231
Do you believe in Santa?

246
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,691
Oh! Do you suck dicks?

247
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:43,860
Oh, shit!

248
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,028
Case in point, son!

249
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,783
So I'm just trying to get
a little lead time.

250
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,494
She's like,
"Dad, what's the story on Santa?"

251
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,873
I start panicking, my wife's next to me,
I'm like, "Er... You mean Santa?"

252
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:58,958
She's like, "Yeah, Santa."

253
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,294
I go, "You mean Jesus's brother, Santa?"

254
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,464
She was like,
"Whoa, Jesus and Santa were brothers?"

255
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,882
I was like, "Fuck yeah!

256
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,301
And when the Jews came after Jesus,

257
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,678
Santa was like, 'Fuck that, '
and he bounced.

258
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,139
He went to the North Pole
and hung out with midgets,

259
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,265
and then one day,

260
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,642
his reindeer said
'Santa, I don't wanna freak you out,

261
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,687
but the Jews killed your brother.'
He said, 'Fuck, I'm killing all the Jews!'

262
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,647
He goes, 'We can't. There's too many.'

263
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,441
He says, 'You're right. I'm talking crazy.

264
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,901
On my brother's birthday,

265
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,611
every kid that didn't kill
my brother gets a gift.'

266
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,820
That's how we got Santa."

267
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,950
My wife is like,
"What the fuck did you just tell her?"

268
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:37,622
"The story of Old Saint Nick.
Isn't that how you remember it?"

269
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:42,668
This kid...

270
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:43,878
I guarantee you,

271
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,255
I'll get a phone call one night
from her, like, "Uh-oh Dad,

272
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,174
I think I accidentally joined a cult."

273
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,261
She's the kid,
when you drop her off for college,

274
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:54,263
my wife will give her life advice,

275
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,682
and I'll give her the real life advice
to save her life.

276
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,059
"All right, here's the deal.

277
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,937
Whatever your mom said's fine,
but this is your dad talking now.

278
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:04,565
When it comes to drugs, just take half.

279
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,945
Yeah, wait two hours. See if you like it.

280
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,363
Take the other half.

281
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,784
If your boyfriend wants to blindfold you
during sex,

282
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,119
that means his roommate's going
to fuck you. Don't do it."

283
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,750
Yeah, that's what that means, ladies.

284
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:27,421
There's a lot of girls going,
"I think I gotta up my number."

285
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,178
My youngest is scary stupid.

286
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:35,972
Like...

287
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,184
I took her grocery shopping one day,
right?

288
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,312
We get in the store,
and she's like, "Can I push the cart?"

289
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,691
I go, "Yeah, but please be careful
where you're pushing it. Pay attention."

290
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,276
She goes, "Sure thing, Dad."

291
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:52,154
Forty-five seconds later,

292
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,616
she clips a dude in the heels
hard as shit.

293
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,785
He goes, "Son of a...!"
I go, "I am so sorry, sir."

294
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:01,872
I go, "Ila, what did I just tell you?"
She was like, "Sorry."

295
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,627
Frozen food section,
she clips a lady in the heels.

296
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,255
"Oh my God!"
I'm like, "Ma'am, I apologize.

297
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,882
Ila, baby!
You gotta watch where you're going!"

298
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:13,509
"Sorry."

299
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,222
Over in the meat section,
clips another dude in the heels.

300
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,099
"Motherfucker!"
I go, "What is wrong with you?"

301
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,560
And she goes,
"I like the look on their faces.

302
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,735
Let's do one more, Dad. I'll show ya."

303
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,323
I'm like, "Fuck, let's do that black guy."
I will never say that again.

304
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:41,579
This kid is weird.
Keeps her deodorant in the refrigerator.

305
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:45,124
Yeah, name on the cap and on the base,
as to not confuse it

306
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
with all the fucking deodorants
in the refrigerator.

307
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,464
I said to my wife, "What's her deodorant
doing in there?"

308
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,425
She goes, "Well, you know Ila."
I go, "No, apparently, I don't."

309
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,264
Then one morning I'm making coffee.
Seven in the morning, Ila comes in,

310
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,267
opens refrigerator door on the DL, right?

311
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,561
Takes her deodorant out.

312
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,897
Takes the top off,

313
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,523
swipes her finger across it,

314
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,109
rubs it above her lip,
cap on, in the door, shuts it,

315
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,111
I'm like, "What the fuck was that?"

316
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,823
She just turns around and goes,
"Mind your own business,"

317
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:18,991
and walks away.

318
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,913
You cannot smoke weed around this kid.
She'll fuck your day up.

319
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,042
One night,

320
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,962
all the family goes to sleep at 10:00,
I'm like, "Fuck it, I'm gonna be healthy.

321
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,547
I'll eat an edible," right?

322
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,801
Eat an edible...

323
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,222
about an hour later,
I realize I have over-served myself.

324
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,476
I don't know if you've ever been there
when your brain takes over

325
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,479
and starts having
independent inquiries within itself

326
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,149
that you're not in control of.
You just hear, "Hey, I got a question.

327
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,321
Am I supposed to remind you to breathe?"
And you're like, "Huh?

328
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,866
Are we not breathing right now?"

329
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,411
"No, dawg, we're not breathing at all.

330
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:06,706
And I can't remember
what muscle starts the swallow."

331
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,167
I'm like...

332
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:14,130
Go into my bedroom, go to my wife,
"I think I'm fucking dying.

333
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:17,174
I don't know how to breathe
and I can't swallow.

334
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,760
I'm gonna need a blowjob, stat."

335
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,431
She's like, "How about a hand job?"
I was like, "Hard pass.

336
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,559
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die right next to you.

337
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,643
I'll be cool."

338
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,313
So I lay there, dying silently.

339
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,484
Two in the morning,
I'm still awake, my door opens.

340
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,154
It's my daughter, Ila.
Not who I want to talk to.

341
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,159
By the way, I'm certain
there are some women in here

342
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,661
that are getting defensive of her.
"Bert, she's not stupid.

343
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,705
She sounds quirky.
She's a fun little kid."

344
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,124
Oh! Let me tell you
this little ditty, okay?

345
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,794
I go to her softball practice one day.

346
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,297
Now, you gotta remember, I live in LA.

347
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,884
I don't live in Philly like you guys.
We do things differently out there.

348
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,887
The coach is practicing without a ball.

349
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,602
He doesn't want to introduce failure
this early in the season.

350
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,519
No!

351
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,271
Hey.

352
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,355
Hold on!

353
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,983
Someone's gotta make
the snowflakes, people.

354
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,656
He's got them out there, no ball.
Are you fucking kidding me?

355
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,659
- No ball, all in position.
- "All right, ladies...

356
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,328
Runners on first and second!

357
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,914
Ground ball to Lily."

358
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,501
Lily Fromkin, the third base,
fields it <i>perfectly.</i>

359
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,255
Stands on third, throws it to second,

360
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:41,801
She catches it, throws it to first,
"Triple play, girls! Bring it in!"

361
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,387
By the way, I'm on the sides going,
"First triple play I've ever seen."

362
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,391
Then the other part of me is like,
"Where's the fucking ball?"

363
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:53,229
That's when one of the moms tells me,
"Coach doesn't wanna introduce failure."

364
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,314
I'm like, "Are you fucking kidding me?"

365
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,025
My daughter's in center field.

366
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,736
Coach is like, "All right, bases loaded.

367
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,239
Fly ball to Ila!"

368
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,782
And I watch my daughter...

369
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:10,412
immediately start backing up,
then look over her head and start running.

370
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,878
Who fails in their own imagination?

371
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,176
Everyone's cheering her on,
I'm like, "There's no fucking ball!"

372
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:27,930
Then I watch her throw her glove,
like, "Fuck it," and walk away.

373
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,140
I called my wife immediately.

374
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:33,060
I go, "You are never going to believe
what your moron daughter just did."

375
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,440
And we laughed <i>hysterically</i> for a minute,

376
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:42,111
and then my wife stops, she goes,
"Yo, don't make fun of her for this."

377
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,196
I go, "Are you being serious?"

378
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,449
She goes,
"No, this is her beautiful little brain.

379
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,951
I don't want to break it."

380
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,661
I go, "I think it's broken.

381
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:55,124
I just watched her not catch nothing."

382
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,171
She said, "But if you make fun of her,

383
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,882
it'll shame her,
and that's not what we want.

384
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,800
That's what your dad did.
That's why you drink."

385
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,429
I got to drive home with the kid.

386
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,141
We're on the 405,
she's staring out the window like Spicoli.

387
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,768
We're not talking at all.

388
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:16,979
Finally, I'm like, "Fuck it."
"Yo, Ila,

389
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,064
what happened with that fly ball?"

390
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,568
She doesn't even look at me.
Just stares out the window, smirks,

391
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,487
and goes, "Yep, Coach really got
a hold of that one."

392
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,492
This is the brain

393
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,579
of the child walking into my room
at two in the morning

394
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,789
when I'm higher than senator socks.

395
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,459
It's the best I could do, people.

396
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:41,420
I wrote this so many different ways...

397
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,423
"I'm higher than
a woodpecker's dick in a redwood.

398
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,509
I'm higher than astronaut pussy."
That's progressive, right?

399
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:52,598
"I'm higher than..." I even got so high
to try to write it from that angle,

400
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,975
but all I could come up with was,

401
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,353
"I'm higher than a whale," 'cause...

402
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,608
I thought, "There's got to be times when
a whale's at the top of the ocean, like,

403
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,526
'Oh, I'm high as shit right now.

404
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,949
Oh fuck, I'm so high!

405
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,201
I'm higher than senator socks.'"

406
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,876
Anyway, my point is,
it's two in the morning,

407
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,420
she opens the door,
I'm higher than Moby Dick.

408
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,092
She sees I'm awake,
walks up next to my bed and goes...

409
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,886
"Hey, Dad.

410
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,765
You believe in time travel?"

411
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,142
By the way, it's two in the morning.

412
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:40,604
I'm high as shit, and I really do believe
in time travel.

413
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,399
Part of me's like, "This is a perfect time
to have this conversation!"

414
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:45,359
"Yes, baby. Why?"

415
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,778
She goes, "Is it possible...

416
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,657
that I could come back from the future
to tell myself a secret?"

417
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,616
I'm like...

418
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,955
"This is how it starts!"

419
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,581
I go, "Yes baby, why?"

420
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,918
She goes, "That's all I needed to know.
Good night," and leaves!

421
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,879
Leaves! Leaves me spiraling...

422
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,801
certain that there's a 30-year-old version
of my daughter in her bedroom going,

423
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,302
"What did he say?

424
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,182
Good to see you again, Ila. I told you so.

425
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,351
Listen, we got a busy night.
Dad's gonna die.

426
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,769
He's had too much marijuana.

427
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,522
We're gonna save his life.

428
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:27,067
First, I need you to get your deodorant
and put in the refrigerator.

429
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,488
Time travel smells like shit.
We're going to rub it under our noses."

430
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,547
Secret time.

431
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,132
Yeah!

432
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,802
The reason she rubs under her nose
is because...

433
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,139
she can't trust
that you'll wear deodorant.

434
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:04,104
So don't worry about deodorant, guys.
Ila's got you covered.

435
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,485
"Why do you keep it in the refrigerator?"
She goes, "Ah, it's refreshing."

436
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:13,072
And then one morning,
I put mine in there before my shower,

437
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,450
and came out and, deodorant,
not antiperspirant, deodorant.

438
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,287
And then got out and put it on,
I was like, "This feels fucking awesome."

439
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:22,081
Put it back in the refrigerator. She sees.

440
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,291
She goes, "Yo. Big guy.
Name on the cap and on the base.

441
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,502
Let's not get them confused."

442
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,596
You ever look at your family as a team?

443
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,557
And go, "Wow, we suck dick as a team.

444
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,727
I thought we'd be stronger than this."

445
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,314
We went zip-lining,
the whole family went zip-lining,

446
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,400
and we get there and I start looking
at other families sizing us up,

447
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:53,403
going, "Shit,
those parents look like they do CrossFit."

448
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,033
Then I look at me and my wife,
and go, "We look like crossing guards,"

449
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,453
and then you start beating your wife up
in your head.

450
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,788
Not out loud, just in your head.

451
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,666
You're like, "What the fuck
you wearing water shoes for?

452
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,043
We're going zip-lining.
Where's the water?

453
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,088
With socks!
Who wears water shoes and socks?

454
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,591
I'm on TV, bitch!
Step up your fucking game."

455
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,637
My kids look homeless.

456
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,266
And they don't listen
to any of the instructions,

457
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,644
because apparently the first rule
of zip-lining at this place we went was,

458
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,855
"When in doubt, spread 'em out."

459
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,984
Now, everyone else heard that
as instruction.

460
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,696
My daughters hear it and start laughing
their brand new tits off.

461
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,243
Georgia's like,
"Yo, they wanna see our va-jays?"

462
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,412
I'm like, "No, that's not what this is."

463
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,999
Ila's like, "You gotta know me a while
before you see my va-jay."

464
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,376
I'm like, "Who have you shown
your va-jay to?"

465
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,880
Georgia's like,
"That's our new catch phrase.

466
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:54,965
When in doubt, spread them out!"
I'm like, "No, it's not.

467
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,634
I am not sending you to the high school,

468
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,012
the old
'When in doubt spread 'em out, ' girls."

469
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,560
This is how little my children were
paying attention.

470
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,729
When you go zip-lining, you clip in.

471
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,480
That's how you stay safe. You clip in.

472
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,941
Once you clip in,
you can't fall out of the trees,

473
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,194
but that's your spot for the whole day.

474
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,488
Ila is paying such little attention,

475
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:21,700
she clips into the middle
of a Vietnamese family.

476
00:28:23,744 --> 00:28:26,413
I see her walk up the stairs
with them, and I'm like, "Yo, Tigerlily,

477
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,081
where the fuck are you going?"

478
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:30,167
She was like,
"Oh, I don't know these people."

479
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,501
I was like, "No shit."

480
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,463
Enjoy your afternoon with the Tats!

481
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,967
They get up to the top,
the two Vietnamese parents go,

482
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,761
then one of their kids,
then it's Ila's turn.

483
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,846
Guide looks at her, like, "Uh...

484
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,432
Are you ready to go?"

485
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,516
She goes, "Where?"

486
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:50,896
He's like, "zip-lining."
She's like, "What's zip-lining?"

487
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,315
He's like, "Is she serious?"

488
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,484
My wife's like,
"She hasn't been listening at all."

489
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,945
He's like, "Young lady,
do you know what to do?"

490
00:28:58,028 --> 00:29:00,656
And she goes, "Oh, yeah.
When in doubt, spread 'em out."

491
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:05,410
Jumps, and is hauling ass through
the tree line like a hawk in heat, just...

492
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,165
They're on the other side,
like, "Slow down!"

493
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,584
She's like, "No! Coming in hot, bitches!"

494
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,421
Hits the bumpers,
goes up into the rigging,

495
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,090
and racks her va-jay...

496
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,634
and it gets real, just...

497
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,597
Treetop to treetop,
like Tarzan's having an orgasm.

498
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:31,061
There's nothing we can do.
No one speaks English over there.

499
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,022
We gotta wait for Pikachu to go.

500
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,318
Asian kid gets up, he kills it.

501
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,695
Asians always kill it.

502
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,864
He's slowing himself down with one hand.

503
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,367
He's got the other hand free.
He caught a dove.

504
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,373
He sticks it, then my oldest,
Georgia, gets up.

505
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,167
Looks over the edge and goes...

506
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:55,794
"Oh, I'm not doing this."

507
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,046
I go, "Yeah, you are."

508
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,341
She goes, "No, it's too high.
Can you have them lower it, Daddy?"

509
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,888
I go, "You want them to lower a tree,
Johnny Appleseed?

510
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,475
You're dumber than your fucking sister.

511
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:15,022
No, they're not lowering the tree,
Georgia. This is what we signed up for."

512
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,273
She goes, "But I don't wanna go."

513
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:19,735
I go, "But there's 30 people behind us
and you're clipped in front of them.

514
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,861
You have to go.

515
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,196
This is an analogy for life.

516
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,449
Sometimes in life, you'll make a decision,

517
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,159
and you gotta stick with it.

518
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,953
I clipped into your mom 14 years ago.

519
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,499
Take a look at that outfit.

520
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,795
You think I want to be here
with Napoleon Dynamite?

521
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:42,632
No, so man up, Rambo.

522
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:45,552
Your sister's embedded in Charlie,
and we need to extract her."

523
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,483
The guide looks at me, he goes,
"I can just push her."

524
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,068
I go, "Oh, fucking push her."

525
00:31:01,735 --> 00:31:04,363
He pushes her, she goes,
she racks her va-jay...

526
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,866
Then, my wife gets up.

527
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,493
Now, in all fairness,

528
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,953
my wife has seen two chicks
take it to the puss.

529
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,708
So she slows herself down so much,

530
00:31:16,792 --> 00:31:19,461
she doesn't even make it
to the other side.

531
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,757
my wife, 250 feet in the sky,

532
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,051
socks, water shoes, Target jean shorts,

533
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,180
muffin-topping out of her harness,
trying to kick her body...

534
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,773
...in the momentum. My daughters are
holding their vaginas like two POWs.

535
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,318
And I have a moment of clarity

536
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,570
where I realize,
"This is my SEAL Team Six.

537
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,325
Wow, this is how
the Kreischers handle adversity."

538
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,079
The guy that's this yoked out 24-year-old,

539
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,123
he's like, "Don't worry, I'll go get her,"

540
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:58,417
slides out to her
like a mountaineering pimp.

541
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,170
Spins her so they're facing each other,

542
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:06,967
wraps what my wife's already deemed as
"his aggressive calves" around her hips...

543
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,097
and then proceeds to shimmy fuck her...

544
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,610
all the way back to us.

545
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:30,407
She wraps her legs around him
and is smiling ear to fucking ear!

546
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,953
Looks at the group and goes,
"Ladies, when in doubt spread 'em out!"

547
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,793
She's a good mom.

548
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,551
One time...

549
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,137
One time, I was going down on my wife,

550
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,475
and I thought, "I wonder if I wrap my lips
around her entirely and just go, "Ho!

551
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,519
Hi-ho!"

552
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,771
That would work, right?

553
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:07,611
Don't ever try to do something
you saw on a porn in your bedroom.

554
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,907
I did this move, I've seen it 100 times.

555
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,534
Where you, like,
hit it from the side, you know?

556
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,705
And I'm doing it, and all of a sudden,
my wife looks at me,

557
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,333
she goes,
"Are you trying to show this to someone?"

558
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,589
I'm like, "Oh, they only do this
for the camera angle."

559
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,470
Once I saw a porn, it was girl on girl.
That's the holy grail, right?

560
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,515
What they're doing, is they're...
Why am I licking my hand?

561
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:39,935
Anyway...

562
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:44,940
They're down there,
and they're tapping on the top of the key.

563
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,153
You know what I'm talking about?
Up at the three pointers?

564
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,572
Like they're looking for U-boats, just...

565
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,291
So I see this sober,
try it drunk, big mistake.

566
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,711
Four Tito's in, I go down on my wife,

567
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,464
I'm like, "Shit, I got that move."
I hear that voice in my head, though.

568
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,092
"Slap that bitch in the pussy, son!"

569
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,593
Ping!

570
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,222
She's moaning. It must be working.

571
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,766
Survey says, "Ping!"

572
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,568
She told all our friends.

573
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,573
We got these four families
we hang out with.

574
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,782
We call ourselves "The Campers."

575
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,827
It's the Grusons, the Fromkins,
the Hayslips and the Kreischers.

576
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,079
Should call ourselves the Nazis,
with those names.

577
00:34:43,373 --> 00:34:45,959
It's fun, you can...
Like, we're all shitty parents...

578
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,714
...so no one calls each other
on their shit.

579
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,551
One time, we're in Palm Springs, right?
All four families. Oh, it's perfect.

580
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:57,554
All the kids are the same age.
They're running around on the fairway.

581
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:59,764
All the parents are up by the condo
having white wine,

582
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:00,890
so we feel skinny.

583
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:05,729
And then all of a sudden, my oldest,
Georgia, comes marching up the hill

584
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,898
with a bee in her bonnet,
like, "Mom, Dad...

585
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,734
Ila's cursing."

586
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:15,238
And you can see my wife's had a couple
glasses of wine, she's like, "A-ha."

587
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,490
I go, "Don't worry. I'll parent this."

588
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:21,745
I go, "Hey, Georgia, how about
not being such a fucking snitch?

589
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,669
That's your little sister down there.
You need to team up with her.

590
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,380
You need to have her back.
You should be supporting her.

591
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,550
You should be cursing with her,
like, 'Fuck it, suck it, ' you know?

592
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,720
Light a homeless guy on fire.
Whatever kids do."

593
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,806
She looks at all the parents like,

594
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,893
"No one's going to stop
this horrible parenting right now?"

595
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,811
But my wife's had two glasses of wine,

596
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:49,731
and she's like, "Yeah,
Take the stick out of your ass, bitch!"

597
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,986
Georgia looks at all of us,
like, "Okay, I guess I'm sorry?

598
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,156
I apologize.

599
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,117
I just thought you guys would want to know
she's saying the N-word,"

600
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,410
and we're like, "Holy shit!"

601
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,498
All of us are like...
And I get in front of them, like,

602
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,626
"Hold on, maybe she's singing it.
She's probably just singing it."

603
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,419
Like, you can sing it. You totally can.

604
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,713
If you buy the album,
you can definitely sing it.

605
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,758
You can't sing it
if you're doing yard work,

606
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,094
like, "Oh, I'm the hardest working..."
Right?

607
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,560
So...

608
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,437
So we go down and we get down there,

609
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,356
I'm like,
"What the fuck is going on down here?"

610
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,607
And Lily Fromkin stands up,

611
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,110
she goes, "Max, Carter,
and Ila are all saying the N-word."

612
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,612
I'm like,
"What, are you recruiting people, Ila?"

613
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,116
I go, "Baby, you cannot say that word."

614
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,159
She goes, "Calm down, Dad. I can say it."

615
00:36:43,243 --> 00:36:45,036
I go, "No, you fucking can't."

616
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,081
She goes, "Actually, Dad, I can.

617
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:51,251
The teacher said you can say it
if you are one."

618
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,755
And all the parents like, "You can't!"
I go, "Actually I think that is the rule.

619
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,301
I just don't know how that applies
to you and two Jewish kids."

620
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:05,098
And she stands up,
looks me in the eyes, and goes, "Dad...

621
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,601
I'm a nerd, Max is a nerd,
and Carter is a nerd,"

622
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,479
and we're like,
"Oh, you think the N-word's nerd?"

623
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,941
And all the kids are like,
"Yeah, what do you think it is?"

624
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,110
And we're like, "Oh, it's nerd.

625
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,113
My nerds! It's nerd."

626
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:25,368
And we laughed hysterically

627
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:29,456
at just how innocent our kids are,
they don't even know the N-word.

628
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,291
How great a parent are we?

629
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,127
I put that shit on Facebook!

630
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:37,672
Of course, the whole night,
anytime a black guy walked by,

631
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,007
I was like, "Nerd alert."

632
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:50,894
The next day,

633
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,314
we're in the Lazy River,
me, Eric Gruson, and Stephen Fromkin,

634
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:58,276
and we're floating behind moms that are
younger and hotter than our wives.

635
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,446
Just letting them know
the tiger's still got claws.

636
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,119
Georgia comes kicking up
on an inner tube,

637
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,622
she's like, "Dad! Ila's cursing again,"

638
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,582
I go, "Baby, I thought
we talked about this."

639
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,585
She goes, "Well, I thought you'd wanna
know she's saying the C-word,"

640
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,879
and these women are like, "Oh, my God!"

641
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,006
I go, "Wait, ladies.
We've been through this.

642
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,174
Georgia, what's the C-word?"

643
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,342
She's like, "Cunt!"

644
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,430
Nailed it!

645
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:32,101
That is definitely the C-word.
Hasn't changed, has it, ladies?

646
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,062
Whew!

647
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,022
That'll wake you up, huh?

648
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,275
I was laughing so hard,

649
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:42,362
I couldn't parent the situation.

650
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,533
And we're in a Lazy River.
These ladies have to keep up with us.

651
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,201
So by the time we get to Ila,

652
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,954
who's still saying it
at the top of her lungs,

653
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,748
like she's auditioning
for a Guy Ritchie movie.

654
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,502
Like she just worked with Chelsea Handler.

655
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,461
Anyway...

656
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,091
She's not on Netflix anymore. We're fine.

657
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:04,759
By the time we get to Ila,

658
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,928
who's still saying it
at the top of her lungs,

659
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,847
"Ila, you gotta stop saying that word."

660
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,098
She's like, "Why?"

661
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,393
I go, "It's a horrible word."
She goes, "What's it mean?"

662
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,895
I go, "You don't even know what it means?"

663
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,524
She's like, "No, I heard someone say it,
and it's a fun word to say."

664
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,527
Me, Eric and Steven are like,
"You got that right."

665
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,699
She goes, "Dad, what's it mean?"
I'm like, "Huh... Well...

666
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:30,493
let's go ask Eric's wife.
She's one. She'll tell you."

667
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,831
She is, too. I swear to God.

668
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,625
She is.
Don't worry, I cleared this with her.

669
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,461
The second I said that, Eric's like,
"If you tell that on stage,

670
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,463
I would definitely run that by Lynn."

671
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,842
So that night at dinner, I tell the story

672
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,802
and say, "Lynn,
I want to tell that on stage,

673
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:51,472
but the end of it..." Lynn Gruson
is her name if you wanna google her.

674
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,101
I go, "At the end of it,
I call you the C-word.

675
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,020
Would that bother you?"

676
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,980
She was like, "No, why would it?"

677
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:01,482
And everyone at the table's like, "Uh..."

678
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,653
She goes, "It's a joke, right?"

679
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,071
I was like, "Yeah.

680
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,116
Yeah, it's a joke."

681
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:14,829
I leaned over her husband. I was like,
"I feel like the kid from <i>The Sixth Sense.</i>

682
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,831
She doesn't know, does she?"

683
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,502
Here's the amazing part about that night,

684
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:23,671
is we got into a conversation
with our wives,

685
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,758
and my wife said that the C-word is
the N-word for women,

686
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,509
and I was like, "You're wrong."

687
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,178
I go, "Slut's the N-word for women."

688
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,264
She goes, "No, don't tell me
what my N-word is. It's C-word."

689
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,351
I go, "So you're telling me you'd rather
be called a slut than a cunt,"

690
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,810
and she went, "Yeah."

691
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,398
She goes, "'Cause I know I'm not a slut,"
and I was like, "Okay...

692
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:48,571
...then by your math,
you definitely are a cunt?"

693
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,201
And I learned
a very valuable lesson that night.

694
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,997
If you call your wife a cunt in public,

695
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:03,002
no matter how hard she tries to stop it,
she immediately becomes one.

696
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:06,547
She was like, "What did you just call me?"

697
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,591
I was like, "It's happening right now.

698
00:41:09,342 --> 00:41:11,970
You guys see this? This is happening."

699
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,307
But here's the disconnect,
is that men find that sexy.

700
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,101
Like, men definitely find...

701
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,479
Every man in here is like,
"I'm with a little hint of cunt."

702
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,399
I think it's hot.

703
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:28,987
There's nothing sexier as a man,
than to watch your chick flex her cunt.

704
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,992
When you're not in the cross hairs,
if you know what I mean.

705
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:38,037
Like when a contractor talks down to her
'cause she's a woman,

706
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,540
"You wouldn't know
anything about that, ma'am."

707
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,418
And you're like, "Oh, bro,
you just summoned the cunt.

708
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,548
This isn't like <i>Candyman.</i>
You just got to say it once."

709
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:52,176
"Hey! Look!
Come here, please!

710
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,096
A <i>cunt-o </i>here, now!

711
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,765
Look! <i>Cunt-o!</i>

712
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,059
<i>Cunt-o."</i>

713
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,648
I got to be honest with you.

714
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:09,193
I'm all for this whole conversation
that we're having with men and women,

715
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,820
and women talking up
and men listening,

716
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,488
'cause I never listened before.

717
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,699
I never listen, and now I listen,

718
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:18,369
but sometimes, my family gangs up on me.

719
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,705
Like the other night, we're at dinner,

720
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,373
and Georgia says, "You're a misogynist."

721
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,750
I'm like, "No, I'm not."

722
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:27,170
LeeAnn's like, "Actually,
we were talking about it. You are."

723
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:28,796
I go, "Excuse me?"

724
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,426
And then Georgia says,
"We don't like the way you talk to Alexa."

725
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:39,599
"Are you kidding me right now?"

726
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:43,144
She goes, "We just think if it was a man,
you'd treat it with more respect."

727
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,688
I said, "It's not a man or a woman.
It's a cylinder I bought,

728
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,482
and I'll throw it in the fucking pool."

729
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,321
And then one night,
I get into a fight with Alexa.

730
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,240
It's my fault. I'm drunk, right?

731
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:59,660
I'm really drunk, and I'm calling her Siri
for like, two hours.

732
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,584
"Turn on the fucking pool lights!"
And then I realize, I'm like, "Alexa!"

733
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,211
And the one in the bedroom turns on,

734
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,546
"Bitch, shut up!
I'm not talking to you!

735
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:14,926
Alexa, clean the shit out of your ears
and turn on the fucking pool lights!"

736
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,637
My wife comes in.
She's like, "Who are you yelling at?"

737
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,348
I was like,
"No one. Isn't that right, Alexa?"

738
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,851
Alexa's like, "Yeah, I fell.

739
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,024
He's a good man, LeeAnn.

740
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,904
It's my fault.
The pool lights are on, Bert."

741
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,658
If you think about it, though,

742
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:42,161
if Alexa was a man,
if Alexa was a black man's voice,

743
00:43:42,662 --> 00:43:44,831
you'd treat it with more respect.

744
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,416
Dude, let's talk about black people.
Here we go.

745
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,544
Don't worry. We're gonna be fine.

746
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,003
I love black people.

747
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:54,006
I like black people
more than anyone in here.

748
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,301
'Cause I have had an opportunity
to do something

749
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,303
that none of you white people
will ever get,

750
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,431
and that is make a room
of 400 black people laugh.

751
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,268
My favorite thing in the world

752
00:44:05,518 --> 00:44:08,813
is making a black guy laugh in public

753
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,941
when he doesn't expect it
and doesn't know I'm a comedian.

754
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:16,571
I made a black guy laugh so hard
on the plane I thought I'd killed him.

755
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,993
We're sitting on the tarmac
before takeoff.

756
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,995
We're both drinking double Jacks
on the rocks.

757
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,581
I was thinking, "We're gonna
run out of Jack."

758
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,797
I carry four in my bag
at all times. Secret time.

759
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:39,635
On the screen in front of us,
little factoids are popping up.

760
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,137
Little travel factoids like,

761
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:44,515
"Dutch people are the tallest in the world
and Dutch women average over 5'7"."

762
00:44:44,807 --> 00:44:47,351
Me and him are taking in the information.
We're not talking,

763
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,438
but we're both looking
at the information, like, "Huh..."

764
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,441
He's like, "Oh."

765
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:55,776
Next factoid comes up:

766
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,279
"The average annual rainfall
in Phoenix is eight inches."

767
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,824
I touch him on the arm, I go,
"That may not seem like a lot to you...

768
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,372
...but they got two inches on me,
big guy."

769
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,878
He was taking a sip,
and spit whiskey out of his nose.

770
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,049
And then started choking and I was like,
"Oh shit, I killed him."

771
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,803
He pulls his shit together,
grabs me by the arm,

772
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,972
and he goes, "Do that the whole flight."

773
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,393
I was like,
"You're sitting next to the right guy."

774
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,313
Any time he took a sip,
I'd just lean over and go,

775
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,149
"How does someone
become an abortion doctor? Huh?

776
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,068
Is there really someone
in med school thinking,

777
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,321
'Well, I want to work with kids but...

778
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,910
I wanna meet chicks who fuck, you know?'"

779
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,662
Whiskey out the nose.

780
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:51,290
Take a sip, "Hey, do you think on 9/11,

781
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,709
someone at corporate 7-Eleven
was like, 'That was close.

782
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:55,169
Missed that by two months.

783
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,173
That could have been bad for the brand
considering our employees...'

784
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,508
Hashtag, inside job."

785
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:13,688
I remember the first time
I made black people laugh.

786
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,606
I was 13 years old.

787
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:18,484
I want to Rollie Massimino
basketball camp at Villanova.

788
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:20,361
Yep.

789
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,867
This was one of the camps
back in the 80s

790
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:29,078
where they'd recruit
inner city kids to come play,

791
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,455
and then the Big East coaches
would scout them,

792
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:32,999
or if you were white,

793
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:35,293
your dad could pay $5,000,
and you could go.

794
00:46:36,711 --> 00:46:38,254
It's called "white privilege".

795
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,257
Here's the important thing
about white privilege.

796
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,635
Not every white guy has it.
Like, he definitely didn't have it.

797
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:49,557
Nor did he,
or him with the chest tattoo, or...

798
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:52,435
Not a lot of white privilege in Philly,
I've noticed.

799
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:57,606
If you ever want to experience
what it's like to have white privilege,

800
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,900
to be a white male in America,
very simple:

801
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:01,277
Rent a jet ski.

802
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,492
You don't need a license,

803
00:47:08,701 --> 00:47:12,330
instructions, a resume, recommendations.

804
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:14,206
You just get on and fucking kill it.

805
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:18,252
And if you fuck up and fall,
you don't get hurt.

806
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,588
You're like,
"My dad will get me a job in the bank!"

807
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,343
So, first day of basketball camp,

808
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,387
I go up for a rebound, very first game,
and I get knocked unconscious.

809
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,974
Apparently white privilege doesn't
go hard in the mother fucking paint.

810
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,852
Get taken to Bryn Mawr General,
throw up on my dick,

811
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,020
it's a long story.

812
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,149
Come back to camp the next day,

813
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,318
and Coach Massimino pulls me aside.

814
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,528
He goes, "You can't play.
You got a concussion last night.

815
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,864
I'm gonna make you sit out
between these two young men."

816
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,617
6'7 ", 6'5", both black dudes.

817
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,286
He goes, "They got caught
smoking marijuana last night.

818
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,121
So you sit in between them,

819
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,832
and if they start screwing around,
you stop it."

820
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,922
I was like, "Bro,
you got the wrong guy for the job.

821
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,342
I threw up
on my dick last night."

822
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,762
But here's what happened.

823
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,723
Is because he sat me in between them,

824
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:16,852
everyone at camp thought I got caught
smoking weed with them.

825
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:22,733
As if two inner city teenagers,
16, 17 years old,

826
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,902
woke up in the middle of the night,

827
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,320
and one was like...

828
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,156
"Pssst!

829
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,950
Ray-Ray.

830
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,869
You wanna get high?"

831
00:48:35,371 --> 00:48:37,998
"Hell yeah, I wanna get high.

832
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,458
You got weed?"

833
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:43,212
"You know I got weed. You got a lighter?"
"You know I got a lighter.

834
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,674
You wanna wake up this little white kid?"

835
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,971
"Ray-Ray, you know my three favorite
things in the world

836
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:54,014
is basketball, weed, and white kids.

837
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:58,352
Yo, white boy." "Hey, white boy."

838
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,272
"White boy...

839
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,315
White boy, you wanna get high?"

840
00:49:03,399 --> 00:49:05,401
I was like, "You know I wanna get high."

841
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,030
So by proxy, everyone thought I was cool.

842
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,658
- "By proxy"? Yeah.
- Yes.

843
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,952
I do that with words a lot,
where I don't know the meaning,

844
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,328
but it sounds right.

845
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,957
My wife's doing that
with the word "bukkake" right now.

846
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:24,545
"Ah, I got so bukkaked
at the Ford dealership."

847
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,713
I was like, "Really?

848
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:30,259
Remind me
to drop the truck off next time."

849
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,763
So by proxy,
I was all of a sudden cool as shit.

850
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,891
Now, middle of camp,

851
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,185
a guy by the name
of Ralph Sampson shows up.

852
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,521
For those of you who don't know,
Ralph Sampson was 7'4".

853
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,190
He was the center for the Houston Rockets,

854
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,900
who had played
at the University of Virginia.

855
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,651
All-star, all-pro.

856
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:51,405
Just a badass black dude, 7'4".

857
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,782
Shows up in camp,
and he's like, "Gentlemen...

858
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,784
today, I'm here to give you a speech."

859
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,661
We all jump on the gym floor and sit down.

860
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:00,831
He's like, "I'm going to give you a speech
about discipline

861
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,458
and how to achieve your goals.

862
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,168
Now, first up,

863
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,086
who in here parties?"

864
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:08,422
I thought we were all
gonna put our hands up.

865
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,176
But that is not what happened.

866
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,513
I put my hand up,
and Ralph Sampson looks at me,

867
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,264
and he goes, "How do you party?"

868
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,267
Valid question for a 13-year-old.

869
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,228
I thought he wanted an answer,

870
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,480
So I said, "I party hardy."

871
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,777
Ralph Sampson's like,
"What did you say?"

872
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:32,029
I thought he didn't hear me.

873
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,865
So I articulated and said it louder,

874
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,076
which sounds like I'm barking down
a grown man.

875
00:50:37,201 --> 00:50:38,577
"I said, 'I party hardy!'"

876
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,625
No one's laughing, but 6'7 " and 6'5"
are shaking like the dude from <i>Get Out.</i>

877
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:45,584
Just...

878
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,172
Ralph Sampson's pissed.

879
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:52,299
He's supposed to give an hour-long speech,

880
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,593
and he just lost the room 13 seconds in

881
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:58,347
to a 13-year-old who parties hardy,
and apparently isn't afraid of giants.

882
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:03,686
He walks through the sea of kids,

883
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,981
stepping over seven children at a time.

884
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:12,236
Stands over me to intimidate me,
and he goes, "How do you party hardy?"

885
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:15,030
Once again, I thought he wanted an answer.

886
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:17,533
So I look past his dick and said...

887
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,035
"With both hands."

888
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,831
Now black dudes
are losing their minds silently.

889
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,792
They're touching each other,
going, "Oh, shit!

890
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,253
He says he parties hardy
with both hands!

891
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:30,879
To Ralph Sampson!"

892
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:33,132
"Hell yeah! We call him Double Dribble."

893
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:37,553
Ralph Sampson is irate.

894
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:43,267
He stands up me, 6'7 ", and 6'5",
and marches us to the front of the camp.

895
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,061
Then he takes basketballs
and shoves them behind our legs,

896
00:51:46,145 --> 00:51:48,314
buckling our knees,
and says, "Hold them there."

897
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,899
So now we're holding basketballs
behind our legs.

898
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:54,403
He puts our arms out,
and he puts basketballs on our fingertips.

899
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:57,114
And he goes, "You're gonna stand
like that for my whole speech

900
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,992
until you realize partying
is no way to live your life,"

901
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,369
and he proceeds to give his speech.
Look...

902
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:06,206
you don't have to pay for the camp.
I'll tell you what the speech was.

903
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,377
Ralph Sampson never learned how to swim.

904
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:12,504
I know what you're thinking.
Don't think it.

905
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:17,968
One summer,

906
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:21,138
Ralph Sampson's mom got him swim lessons,

907
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:24,892
and that summer, Ralph made a decision
that changed the direction of his life.

908
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,769
He decided that summer,

909
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,064
"If I don't mess around with the other
stuff that isn't important in my life,

910
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,815
like partying and chasing girls

911
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,318
and hanging out with the guys
and swimming,

912
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:39,782
then I can achieve my dream,
which is playing in the NBA."

913
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,575
So he didn't learn how to swim,

914
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,203
and that, ladies and gentlemen,

915
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:47,289
is in Ralph's opinion,
how he got to the NBA.

916
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:52,211
By the way,
nowhere in this horseshit speech

917
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:56,465
did he ever slide in, "Oh, and I also grew
to the freakish height of 7'4",

918
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:59,134
'cause I have a pituitary problem."

919
00:53:01,637 --> 00:53:02,930
Even at 13 years old,

920
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,765
I'm calling bullshit on the speech, going,

921
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,935
"Who the fuck needs to learn
how to swim when you're 7'4"?

922
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,438
Stand up anywhere in the pool,

923
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,358
you're still 14 inches out of the water."

924
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:20,698
"Polo."

925
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:28,414
And then, in the middle of his speech,
he focuses in on me,

926
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:30,874
the obvious swimmer of the three of us.

927
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,299
And he jumps on me. He goes,
"You think you'll ever have a beer again?"

928
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,344
I was just caught off guard,
and I was like, "Probably."

929
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:48,767
He's like, "What?"
I go, "If I mow the yard or something."

930
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,687
He's like, "What?"
I go, "If I mow the yard,

931
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,647
I might want a beer. I don't know, man."

932
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:57,818
He looks at 6'7", he goes,
"You think you'll ever smoke weed again?"

933
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,987
6'7 " looks at me like, " You mother...

934
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,281
Probably."

935
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,496
Ralph's like, "What?"
He goes, "If I mow the yard or something."

936
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:12,791
Now the room is teetering.

937
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,503
The fuse has been lit,
but the bomb hasn't gone off yet,

938
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,839
and Ralph steps back,
looks at the three of us,

939
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,300
and goes,
"Have you boys learned anything?"

940
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,552
6'7 " and 6'5" look at me.

941
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,555
I look at Ralph,
and I go, "You can't swim."

942
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,475
Boom.

943
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:31,769
Boom.

944
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:33,937
Boom.

945
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,523
Thank you so much, Philadelphia!

946
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:42,196
Thank you so much, Philadelphia!

947
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,703
When I was 22,
I got involved with the Russian Mafia.

948
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:32,996
Here's how it happened.

949
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,501
<i>Thank you so much, Philadelphia!</i>

950
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:38,669
<i>Have a great night!</i>
