00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:08,204
<i>♪ I got gas in the tank ♪</i>

2
00:00:08,205 --> 00:00:10,644
<i>♪ I got money in the bank ♪</i>

3
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:14,725
<i>♪ I got news for you, baby
You're looking at the man ♪</i>

4
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,964
Someone came up to me in the street
and said, "Are you Jimmy Carr,

5
00:00:18,965 --> 00:00:20,445
or do you just look like Jimmy Carr?"

6
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:22,284
I said, "Both."

7
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:29,124
I've been described
as the hardest-working man in comedy,

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,405
which is... not that impressive, is it?

9
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:33,564
I mean, "the hardest-working man,"
that's good,

10
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,445
but "in comedy" takes the shine
off that compliment.

11
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,964
The hardest-working man in comedy.

12
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:40,604
It's like being the best-looking guy

13
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:41,885
in the burns unit.

14
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,365
No offense to any burns victims
we have here.

15
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:49,724
Are there any burns victims in?

16
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:52,525
I mean, if there's one, there'll be
loads. They tend to stick together.

17
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,164
And we're off!

18
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:06,844
That's a very good
reaction to that joke,

19
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:09,485
because that joke is very much
a canary in the mine.

20
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,805
That is there to test the air.

21
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:15,444
If you're sat there thinking,
"That was funny,"

22
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:16,765
you're in for a lovely evening.

23
00:01:17,965 --> 00:01:20,085
If you're thinking,
"That was a bit much, actually..."

24
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,445
It's going to be
a fucking long night for you.

25
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:30,324
Do you know the average person
laughs out loud

26
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:32,044
ten times a day?

27
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,445
Not everyone, obviously.

28
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:36,965
If you work in a hospice
or with learning disabled adults...

29
00:01:38,445 --> 00:01:39,845
it could be ten times that.

30
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:43,525
Sky's the limit. Dare to dream.

31
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,164
They say that laughter
is the best medicine.

32
00:01:49,165 --> 00:01:50,964
So maybe, just maybe,

33
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:52,965
if we all keep
laughing at people in wheelchairs...

34
00:01:57,925 --> 00:02:00,085
You look slightly concerned
there, madam.

35
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:02,764
Let me just take a
moment to reassure you.

36
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,044
During that last joke,

37
00:02:04,045 --> 00:02:06,485
no-one in a wheelchair
has ever walked out.

38
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,324
Look, before we start properly,

39
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:19,124
we should probably talk
about how PC works in comedy,

40
00:02:19,125 --> 00:02:22,124
because there are rules and regulations
that govern what I can

41
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:24,124
and what I can't say up here on stage.

42
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,764
So basically, how PC works in comedy is,

43
00:02:26,765 --> 00:02:28,884
if you're directly involved
or affected by something,

44
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:29,884
you get a free pass.

45
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:32,164
You're allowed to joke about that thing.

46
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:34,805
So, for example, disabled people
could joke about disability.

47
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,004
Homosexual people
could joke about being gay.

48
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:39,324
Black or Asian people
could joke about race.

49
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,164
Those are the rules.

50
00:02:41,165 --> 00:02:43,565
So these two pedophiles
walk into a park...

51
00:02:48,845 --> 00:02:49,845
What?

52
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,564
A lot of people don't think pedophiles

53
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:56,284
should be allowed to live
anywhere near schools.

54
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,925
But it does reduce
their carbon footprint.

55
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:06,005
If you're scared of pedophiles...

56
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:07,565
grow up.

57
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:17,524
Now, I don't want to offend anyone
here this evening with my language.

58
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:21,004
I know certain people have got
certain words they just don't like.

59
00:03:21,005 --> 00:03:23,964
So to avoid causing offense
unnecessarily tonight,

60
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,564
if I refer to a vagina at any point,
which I'm bound to do...

61
00:03:26,565 --> 00:03:28,124
You know the kind of comedian I am.

62
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:30,724
But if I refer to a vagina at any point
this evening, I'll call it...

63
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:32,844
What's the least offensive term?
Front bottom?

64
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:35,005
No-one's offended
by the term "front bottom," are they?

65
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:38,525
So, for this evening,
"front bottom" and "back cunt."

66
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,125
Let's keep this classy, shall we?

67
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:48,204
When Donald Trump first took to office,

68
00:03:48,205 --> 00:03:49,565
little did he know...

69
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:59,364
Trump ran on wanting to build a wall.

70
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:02,845
And I think that's his one good idea,
because walls work.

71
00:04:03,725 --> 00:04:05,405
It's irrefutable. Yeah.

72
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,245
I was in China last year.
I didn't see one Mexican.

73
00:04:11,645 --> 00:04:13,484
When I was younger,
I couldn't talk to women,

74
00:04:13,485 --> 00:04:16,205
because I was hiding in their wardrobes
masturbating.

75
00:04:20,325 --> 00:04:22,764
It's very difficult
to get the first kiss right.

76
00:04:22,765 --> 00:04:24,964
You want to be firm, but gentle.

77
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,084
You want to be manly,

78
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,285
you don't want to wake her up.

79
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:32,444
You've got to be very
careful with jokes,

80
00:04:32,445 --> 00:04:33,444
especially gentlemen.

81
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,044
Men get carried away with jokes.

82
00:04:35,045 --> 00:04:36,884
Men joke in inopportune situations.

83
00:04:36,885 --> 00:04:38,244
Men often joke in the bedroom.

84
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,445
That's never a good idea.

85
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:43,444
Yeah, it's quite funny to say to a girl
who's going down on you,

86
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:45,245
"It's rude to talk
with your mouth full."

87
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,564
But it's even funnier if she says,

88
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,085
"Well, it's not full."

89
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,884
I had a friend that used to self-harm,

90
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:58,124
because he was bullied.

91
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,125
I used to think...

92
00:04:59,525 --> 00:05:00,525
"Whose side are you on?"

93
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:08,085
If there's a fight,
I let my fists do the talking.

94
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,165
"Please don't hurt me."

95
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:18,964
If a giant ape and a table tennis
champion got into an argument

96
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:20,885
over a karaoke machine
in the Far East...

97
00:05:24,125 --> 00:05:25,764
would the newspaper headline be:

98
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:28,485
"Hong Kong Ping Pong King Kong
Sing-Song Ding Dong"?

99
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:33,885
That's quite a silly joke.

100
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:38,644
I was trying to write the shortest joke
possible, so I wrote a four-word joke.

101
00:05:38,645 --> 00:05:40,485
Venison's dear, isn't it?

102
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,164
Then a three-word joke.

103
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,725
Stationery store moves.

104
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,964
And then a blink and you'll miss it,
two-word joke.

105
00:05:50,965 --> 00:05:52,285
Dwarf shortage.

106
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,045
I'll tell you what I know about dwarfs.

107
00:05:58,605 --> 00:05:59,605
Very little.

108
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,444
Truth be told, I fucking love dwarfs,

109
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:05,684
but I never tell them that I love them,

110
00:06:05,685 --> 00:06:07,765
because I don't want them
to get big-headed.

111
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:17,884
I was in Brussels last year doing shows

112
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:20,284
and something interesting happened
when I was in Brussels,

113
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:21,765
which you don't get to say every day.

114
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,684
They had a baby panda in Brussels Zoo.

115
00:06:24,685 --> 00:06:26,044
Aww.

116
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:27,404
And they told you on the news

117
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:29,444
how they make baby pandas.

118
00:06:29,445 --> 00:06:31,044
Yeah. It's not how you think.

119
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:34,405
It's not a mommy panda
and a daddy panda fucking.

120
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:37,364
Pandas are not down to fuck.

121
00:06:37,365 --> 00:06:39,885
They're sort of like the opposite
of girls from Dublin.

122
00:06:48,565 --> 00:06:51,325
There's a look of civic pride there
from some of the ladies.

123
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,565
A look as if to say,
"We do like the D."

124
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:59,004
So if you want to have a baby panda,

125
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:01,484
what you do
is you phone up the Chinese authorities.

126
00:07:01,485 --> 00:07:02,964
All pandas in the world are Chinese.

127
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,005
They'll lend you a panda.

128
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,644
They're not giving away their pandas.

129
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:07,004
So you phone up the Chinese authorities,

130
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:09,844
they send over a panda fertility expert.

131
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,124
Here's where it gets interesting.

132
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,044
This panda fertility expert
brings with him, in his luggage,

133
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:15,964
a full-size, man-size,

134
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:18,285
dress-up, zip-up panda outfit,

135
00:07:19,365 --> 00:07:21,485
replete with enormous panda head.

136
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,165
Who knew?

137
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,645
That's not his name.
I'm saying I did not know that.

138
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:33,364
So he flies to Brussels,
he's got the outfit with him,

139
00:07:33,365 --> 00:07:34,964
he says hello to everyone
at Brussels Zoo,

140
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:36,324
friendly enough, as well he might be,

141
00:07:36,325 --> 00:07:37,884
and then it's right down to business.

142
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:40,404
He dresses up from head to toe
as a panda,

143
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:41,764
pops on his big panda head,

144
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,444
walks into Mr. Panda's enclosure

145
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:45,444
dressed from head to toe as a panda

146
00:07:45,445 --> 00:07:46,445
and he, uh...

147
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:49,845
He wanks off Mr. Panda.

148
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,285
Dressed as a panda.

149
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:56,245
So if anyone here's thinking,
"Oh, I've had a tough week at work..."

150
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,445
Have you?

151
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:01,805
Have you, though?

152
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:03,524
Did you wank off a panda?

153
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:05,005
No, you fucking didn't.

154
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:08,684
So he wanks off a panda,
dressed as a panda.

155
00:08:08,685 --> 00:08:12,365
Incidentally, that is the day
to visit the zoo. Am I right?

156
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:16,965
"Come here, kids.
You're not going to believe this.

157
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:20,245
I don't think that one's
even a real panda."

158
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,404
So he wanks off a panda,
dressed as a panda,

159
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,164
they collect the panda semen...

160
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:30,445
Obviously.
Otherwise, what just happened?

161
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,404
"Who was that bloke?"

162
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:36,525
"I thought he was with you."

163
00:08:37,565 --> 00:08:38,765
"Shit, it's happened again."

164
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,004
So they collect the panda semen
and then they wait.

165
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:46,564
They wait until the female panda
is asleep in her enclosure.

166
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:49,564
And then they creep into the female
panda's enclosure as she sleeps

167
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:52,364
and they artificially inseminate
the female panda as she sleeps.

168
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,484
I'm not sure who does that.

169
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:55,405
I presume Bill Cosby.

170
00:09:04,885 --> 00:09:06,164
I bloody love show business.

171
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:07,364
Every night after the show,

172
00:09:07,365 --> 00:09:09,924
I have attractive women
banging on my dressing room door,

173
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:10,924
and sometimes...

174
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:11,965
I let them out.

175
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,925
Are you alright at the back?
How are the people up there?

176
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,524
Excellent news.

177
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:23,884
Sometimes, if I see a show,
if I'm at the back of the room,

178
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:25,684
I've got a weird fear of missing out.

179
00:09:25,685 --> 00:09:29,324
I feel like, "Are people having more fun
down here than we're having at the back?"

180
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:31,284
But there's advantages
to sitting at the back,

181
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:32,724
because you get
more of a sense of occasion,

182
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:34,204
more of a sense of
people coming together

183
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:35,844
and sharing a sense of humor,

184
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:37,644
that great music hall spirit.

185
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,244
You get more of a sense of that
from the back of the room.

186
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,124
And the other advantage
to sitting at the back

187
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,164
is this sort of thing won't happen.

188
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,165
I fucked your mum.

189
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:49,405
That's not going to
happen to any of you.

190
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,965
I've got nothing but respect
for your mums.

191
00:09:55,965 --> 00:09:58,005
Hard-working, decent women.

192
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:05,405
I still owe your mum 20 Euro.

193
00:10:08,165 --> 00:10:10,165
That's right. I paid for everyone.

194
00:10:15,965 --> 00:10:18,444
Sorry, I've been terribly rude there.
Sir, what's your name?

195
00:10:18,445 --> 00:10:20,285
Shane.
What do you do, Shane?

196
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,284
I'm still in school.

197
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,285
You're in school?

198
00:10:28,325 --> 00:10:29,484
How old are you, Shane?

199
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,284
Eighteen.
You're 18?

200
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:33,244
Okay, Shane.
And who are you here with, Shane?

201
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,765
My dad.
Your dad?

202
00:10:35,605 --> 00:10:36,605
No.

203
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:38,685
No, Shane.

204
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:41,525
You're with the man
you think is your dad.

205
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:46,165
Could be any one of us.

206
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:52,044
Well, apologies, Shane,

207
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,765
because, I mean, this evening
does not work out well for you.

208
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,604
Your mum gets quite a few mentions.

209
00:10:57,605 --> 00:10:59,204
I hope you're going
to be okay with that.

210
00:10:59,205 --> 00:11:00,325
Are you going to be alright?

211
00:11:01,405 --> 00:11:03,445
You're in for quite
a rough ride tonight.

212
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:06,125
Is what I said to your mum
the last time I saw her.

213
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:13,085
It's that sort of thing
pretty much fucking continually. Okay.

214
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:17,244
When I'm away from home,
I sometimes get love sick.

215
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:19,005
Well, they call it chlamydia.

216
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:26,044
I was in a hotel having breakfast
and the waiter said to me,

217
00:11:26,045 --> 00:11:28,324
"Do you want white or brown toast?"

218
00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:29,684
I said, "All toast is brown.

219
00:11:29,685 --> 00:11:30,765
You're thinking of bread."

220
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,284
He said, "What room are you in?"

221
00:11:38,285 --> 00:11:39,605
I said, "It's the dining room."

222
00:11:42,885 --> 00:11:45,044
I was on tour recently
and walked into a hotel room,

223
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:48,685
and on the TV screen, it just said,
"The adult channel is disabled."

224
00:11:52,325 --> 00:11:53,805
I thought, "That's a bit specialist.

225
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:57,245
How did they know I'd be into that?"

226
00:11:58,925 --> 00:11:59,925
Lucky guess.

227
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:04,244
A lot of people text whilst driving.

228
00:12:04,245 --> 00:12:05,204
I'm not excusing it,

229
00:12:05,205 --> 00:12:07,525
but we've all done things we regret
when we're drunk.

230
00:12:11,245 --> 00:12:13,644
We have all done things we regret
when we're drunk.

231
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,725
Some of you may be with one of them
this evening.

232
00:12:17,725 --> 00:12:19,805
Some very good sideways
glancing going on.

233
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,964
Backseat drivers, they're all the same,
aren't they?

234
00:12:24,965 --> 00:12:27,005
"Why are we going into the woods?
Please let me go."

235
00:12:30,005 --> 00:12:32,285
"I am trying to maintain an erection."

236
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:40,924
Here's a question. Does anyone in
the room believe in the supernatural?

237
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,885
Ghosts and spirits and the like. Anyone?

238
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:44,724
Yes!
Quite a lot of you.

239
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:48,325
It's actually easy
to tell if your house is haunted.

240
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,125
It isn't.

241
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:53,685
Grow up.

242
00:12:58,725 --> 00:13:01,684
There's actually a special name
for people that have seen a ghost.

243
00:13:01,685 --> 00:13:03,405
It's... schizophrenic.

244
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,484
People claim to be into recycling,

245
00:13:07,485 --> 00:13:09,925
but you should see their faces
when you rinse out a condom.

246
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:18,444
Women usually take care of contraception
within relationships,

247
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:20,564
but some men do and they're called...

248
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:21,565
dads.

249
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:27,804
I've got a friend, she's got a theory.

250
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:30,724
She reckons the way
to drive a man wild with desire

251
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:33,405
is to nibble on his earlobes
for hours and hours.

252
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:35,005
I think it's bollocks.

253
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:42,886
Has everyone that's going to get it
got it? Let's move on.

254
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:47,644
I've got a friend whose
nickname is "Shagger."

255
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:49,244
You might think that's quite cool.

256
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,365
She doesn't like it.

257
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,404
My girlfriend said to me recently,

258
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:56,085
"Have you been having
sex behind my back?"

259
00:13:56,725 --> 00:13:58,725
I said, "Who the fucking hell
did you think it was?

260
00:14:01,165 --> 00:14:02,124
And another thing.

261
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:04,485
It wouldn't kill you to turn around
and check how I'm doing.

262
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,445
A little bit of encouragement
goes a long way."

263
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:10,884
My girlfriend used to get annoyed at me

264
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,484
because I used to
leave the toilet seat up.

265
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,564
So now I always make a point
of putting the toilet seat down.

266
00:14:15,565 --> 00:14:16,564
Only takes a second.

267
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,724
I know a lot of people
think that's a trivial matter,

268
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:20,044
but I think it's a signifier.

269
00:14:20,045 --> 00:14:23,124
It shows that you care in a small way
each and every day.

270
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,404
So always make a point
of putting the toilet seat down.

271
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:26,644
Of course, there's no winning with her.

272
00:14:26,645 --> 00:14:28,925
Now she's annoyed
because it's covered in piss.

273
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:37,884
I tell these jokes,
but I'm actually a very modern man.

274
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:39,644
I've got no problem buying tampons,

275
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:42,365
but apparently
they're not a "proper present."

276
00:14:46,045 --> 00:14:48,085
"Says super on the box.
I don't know what you want!"

277
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,405
"Happy birthday, Mum."

278
00:14:55,845 --> 00:14:58,764
I bought my girlfriend a book called
<i>Cheap And Easy Vegetarian Cooking,</i>

279
00:14:58,765 --> 00:15:02,485
which is ideal for her,
because not only is she a vegetarian...

280
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:08,884
My girlfriend
said she wanted me to tease her.

281
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:10,085
I said, "Alright, fatty!"

282
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:17,924
The first few weeks
of joining Weight Watchers,

283
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,445
you're just finding your feet.

284
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:28,284
A fat lady came up to me after a show

285
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:29,605
and complained about that joke.

286
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,524
I say a fat lady came up to me.

287
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:32,965
She pretty much surrounded me.

288
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:38,125
She was livid.
She said, "I think you're fattist."

289
00:15:38,765 --> 00:15:39,765
I said, "No."

290
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,925
"I think you're fattest."

291
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,124
Have you ever fucked a girl so fat

292
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,725
you think it might count as a threesome?

293
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,604
I'll tell you when you know
you're with a big girl.

294
00:16:00,605 --> 00:16:03,365
If you've ever found yourself
in the throes of passion, thinking...

295
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,245
"Is that boob or arm?"

296
00:16:07,765 --> 00:16:09,485
"I'll give it a lick just to be sure."

297
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:16,604
A very nice man came up to me
after a show recently and said,

298
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:17,524
"Hey, I'm a fat guy.

299
00:16:17,525 --> 00:16:18,725
How do you think I feel?"

300
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:20,285
I said, "Squidgy."

301
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:25,524
I mean, I tell these jokes,

302
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,404
but I knew I had to lose
a little bit of weight recently.

303
00:16:27,405 --> 00:16:29,524
I think you know, as a man,
when you've got to lose weight.

304
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:30,524
There's warning signs.

305
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,764
There are red flags.

306
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:32,804
I knew I had to lose weight.

307
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,204
A very sad day for any man

308
00:16:34,205 --> 00:16:36,485
when his girlfriend suggests
he cums on his own tits.

309
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:46,284
Most men don't get enough fiber
in their diet. Yeah?

310
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:47,285
Tough shit.

311
00:16:50,085 --> 00:16:52,964
I read a thing recently.
It was in <i>Men's Health Magazine.</i>

312
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:54,964
It said that drinking your own urine

313
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:56,645
is meant to be good for you.

314
00:16:57,365 --> 00:16:58,485
Bullshit.

315
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:00,685
I put my back out.

316
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,805
That was a flattering mime, wasn't it?

317
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:13,725
A double-hander, sir?

318
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:23,524
Half of all women don't groom or style
their pubic hair.

319
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:24,444
Half!

320
00:17:24,445 --> 00:17:25,844
That means, statistically,

321
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,565
either your mum
or your nan is rocking a Brazilian.

322
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,364
Must be your nan, Shane.

323
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:45,645
Seriously, your mum, it was like
a knife wound in a gorilla's back.

324
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:56,205
You've taken that well.

325
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,885
Which I imagine runs in the family,
does it?

326
00:18:05,765 --> 00:18:07,564
People worry about
their physical appearance.

327
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:08,764
We all have silly hang-ups.

328
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:11,325
Personally, I worry
that one of my balls is bigger

329
00:18:11,685 --> 00:18:12,685
than the other two.

330
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:16,724
I shave my testicles.

331
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:18,285
I call them "Brazil nuts."

332
00:18:20,005 --> 00:18:21,045
Makes me giggle.

333
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:23,325
Because it tickles when I do it.

334
00:18:24,485 --> 00:18:26,444
Whenever I'm in the changing rooms
in the gym,

335
00:18:26,445 --> 00:18:27,444
I'm always embarrassed

336
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,445
by the fact my penis
is so much bigger than everyone else's.

337
00:18:31,325 --> 00:18:33,325
But then, in fairness, it is erect.

338
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:44,444
Ten percent of women have cried
in shop fitting rooms.

339
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:45,564
I guess...

340
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:47,125
they weren't expecting to see me there.

341
00:18:51,245 --> 00:18:53,924
My girlfriend recently bought
a T-shirt for 100 Euro.

342
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,845
That's a ridiculous amount to spend
on a t-shirt.

343
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:57,964
It said D&G on the front.

344
00:18:57,965 --> 00:18:58,924
I suppose, fair enough,

345
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,565
one of her tits is
bigger than the other.

346
00:19:05,765 --> 00:19:07,405
We call that one our favorite.

347
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,165
Turn on the taps, test the water.
That's how I remember it.

348
00:19:13,445 --> 00:19:15,084
That's very much foreplay for beginners,
isn't it?

349
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:16,885
Turn on the taps, test the water.

350
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:19,885
Not ready yet.

351
00:19:21,725 --> 00:19:22,805
Not ready yet.

352
00:19:24,885 --> 00:19:26,125
Not ready yet.

353
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,405
Like a fucking Slip 'N Slide. We're on.

354
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:36,004
People with Tourette's.

355
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:37,085
What makes them tick?

356
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:41,965
The worst thing about being told
you've got Alzheimer's

357
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:43,725
is it doesn't just happen once.

358
00:19:46,365 --> 00:19:48,444
I did a show for Alzheimer's sufferers.

359
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:50,125
It was brilliant. Two hours, one joke.

360
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,444
I did a show for Alzheimer's sufferers.

361
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,805
It was brilliant. Two hours, one joke.

362
00:20:01,045 --> 00:20:02,725
I did a show for Alzheimer's sufferers.

363
00:20:05,285 --> 00:20:07,725
My first wife was from Thailand.

364
00:20:08,725 --> 00:20:10,964
Don't, you'll feel bad.
It's actually quite a sad story.

365
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,564
My first wife was from Thailand

366
00:20:12,565 --> 00:20:13,765
and she died of...

367
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,365
testicular cancer.

368
00:20:19,165 --> 00:20:20,884
Probably the best way
I could describe it

369
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,325
is her front bottom was an outie.

370
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:29,645
I recently saw a transvestite
in a mini skirt. I thought...

371
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,525
"That shows a lot of balls."

372
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:39,484
The male gypsy moth can smell
the female gypsy moth

373
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,084
from up to seven miles away.

374
00:20:41,085 --> 00:20:43,524
And that fact also works
if you remove the word...

375
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:44,525
"moth."

376
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:51,044
The first time I told that joke

377
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:52,764
was on BBC Radio 4

378
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:57,005
and we got a letter of complaint in
from the National Gypsy Council.

379
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,124
So I wrote back.

380
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,765
Of course, they'd moved on.

381
00:21:08,925 --> 00:21:10,004
Here's a frightening fact.

382
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:13,284
If you took all the money that we
in the West spend on food in one week,

383
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:16,605
you could feed the third world
for one year.

384
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:19,724
I don't know about you good people,
but I can't help feeling

385
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:22,325
we're being overcharged
for our groceries.

386
00:21:24,885 --> 00:21:27,325
Now my job is writing
harsh, brutal jokes.

387
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:30,165
I can't compete recently
with stuff I've just overheard.

388
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:31,844
I was in a doctor's waiting room,

389
00:21:31,845 --> 00:21:34,404
sat opposite these two ladies
in their early sixties.

390
00:21:34,405 --> 00:21:37,364
One of the ladies, just trying to start
a conversation with her friend,

391
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:38,884
looked down at a copy of the newspaper,

392
00:21:38,885 --> 00:21:40,925
a stark image of famine
on the cover of the paper...

393
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:43,484
and she turned to her friend,
she said, "This famine...

394
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,565
it's terrible, isn't it?"

395
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:46,924
And her friend, without skipping a beat,
went...

396
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:47,925
"Yeah...

397
00:21:48,445 --> 00:21:50,445
but they don't get our winters."

398
00:21:55,045 --> 00:21:56,365
Fucking hell.

399
00:21:57,605 --> 00:21:59,684
There's about half of you laughing
and half of you thinking,

400
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:01,445
"The winter here can be rough."

401
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,164
I got stopped in the
street the other day

402
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:07,004
by one of those charity muggers.

403
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,165
You know, the ones with the clipboard
and the optimism.

404
00:22:10,325 --> 00:22:11,885
Chuggers, a lot of people call them.

405
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,045
I call them "chunts."

406
00:22:16,005 --> 00:22:17,444
Anyway, he stopped me in the street
and went,

407
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:19,924
"Do you know how often
people die from AIDS?"

408
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:21,004
I said, "I'm not an expert,

409
00:22:21,005 --> 00:22:22,685
but I'm guessing just the once, is it?"

410
00:22:29,525 --> 00:22:31,404
My best friend's wife is having a baby.

411
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:32,924
I said, "What do you want?
A boy or a girl?"

412
00:22:32,925 --> 00:22:34,325
And he thought about it. He said...

413
00:22:34,725 --> 00:22:35,805
"I wanted a blowjob."

414
00:22:39,245 --> 00:22:40,445
Really mournful.

415
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:43,804
I like getting a blowjob off the missus.

416
00:22:43,805 --> 00:22:44,964
I don't know if you get this.

417
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:46,845
I don't know if you get a blowjob
off my missus.

418
00:22:47,805 --> 00:22:49,805
I don't know
what your shoe-buying budget is.

419
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,085
A little glimpse into my world.

420
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:57,404
The thing I like about oral sex...

421
00:22:57,405 --> 00:22:59,084
I think the thing most men like
about oral sex,

422
00:22:59,085 --> 00:23:00,004
nothing sexual, ladies,

423
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:01,845
is actually the peace and quiet.

424
00:23:05,325 --> 00:23:08,604
If you've ever been going down on a guy
and he's gone, "Oh,"

425
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:09,885
that is not your technique.

426
00:23:10,405 --> 00:23:12,124
That is not his sexual ecstasy.

427
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,885
That is the sound of a man
not being asked a question.

428
00:23:23,725 --> 00:23:24,724
I would think about adoption.

429
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,444
I don't have kids, but if I had kids,

430
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:28,325
I think I would have them adopted.

431
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:35,324
I haven't got children,
but I have made a start.

432
00:23:35,325 --> 00:23:37,285
I bought some puppies and a van.

433
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:46,204
I had a really awkward moment on stage
recently while I was doing a show

434
00:23:46,205 --> 00:23:48,164
when someone from right in the back
of the room shouted,

435
00:23:48,165 --> 00:23:49,685
"Are you ever going to have children?"

436
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,764
I said, "Look,
it's a perfectly reasonable question.

437
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,604
I don't want to make you feel bad
for asking,

438
00:23:53,605 --> 00:23:54,645
but my girlfriend and I...

439
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,965
actually can't have children...

440
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,125
the way we do it."

441
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,044
What is it about being blind

442
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:12,045
that makes you want to walk the dog
the whole time?

443
00:24:18,445 --> 00:24:20,205
Who picks up guide dog shit?

444
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,085
You can laugh, but no fucker knows.

445
00:24:29,405 --> 00:24:31,885
It's got to be quite a
hit-and-miss operation, hasn't it?

446
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:36,005
Ah, that's warm.

447
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,044
I saw a guy... I was in the high street
near where I live in North London.

448
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,804
I saw a guy with a guide dog
and a white stick.

449
00:24:44,805 --> 00:24:47,364
So I went up to him.
I said, "You must be blind."

450
00:24:47,365 --> 00:24:49,045
He said,
"Tell me something I don't know."

451
00:24:49,805 --> 00:24:51,245
I said, "There's a tree over there."

452
00:24:53,645 --> 00:24:54,765
Be a dick about it.

453
00:24:59,845 --> 00:25:01,724
I had a relationship with a blind girl,

454
00:25:01,725 --> 00:25:04,205
which was rewarding, but challenging.

455
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:07,005
It took me ages
to get her husband's voice right.

456
00:25:11,525 --> 00:25:12,645
Pornography.

457
00:25:13,565 --> 00:25:14,765
I'll cum to that later.

458
00:25:21,245 --> 00:25:22,564
I feel like I'm getting old.

459
00:25:22,565 --> 00:25:25,204
I was watching porn recently
and I found myself thinking,

460
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:26,565
"That bed looks comfy."

461
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,604
Here's an old man thing
I did for the first time recently.

462
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:33,364
I bought Viagra for the first time.

463
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,644
I didn't have a problem per Se,
but I thought,

464
00:25:35,645 --> 00:25:38,406
"You know, we're going away for the
weekend. Let's super-charge this."

465
00:25:39,325 --> 00:25:40,484
And you can now get, in the UK,

466
00:25:40,485 --> 00:25:42,365
over-the-counter Viagra.

467
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,325
I thought, "That sounds powerful."

468
00:25:47,485 --> 00:25:49,285
Over the counter, you say?

469
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:51,165
Thunk.

470
00:25:53,285 --> 00:25:54,564
It's a medication, Viagra.

471
00:25:54,565 --> 00:25:56,124
You've got to take
these things seriously.

472
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,844
So I was reading the side of the box
of the Viagra they sold me.

473
00:25:58,845 --> 00:26:00,644
It said on the side of the box,

474
00:26:00,645 --> 00:26:02,285
"Keep away from children."

475
00:26:04,925 --> 00:26:07,445
I thought, "What kind of a man
do they think I am...

476
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,565
that can't maintain an erection
with a child?"

477
00:26:15,645 --> 00:26:18,365
Well, that joke
separated the men from the boys.

478
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:21,045
Somewhat ironically.

479
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,884
I'm not a big fan of
the predictive text.

480
00:26:27,885 --> 00:26:30,084
It makes you look like an idiot
when you text a lady

481
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:32,605
saying you want to put your
massive clock in her hairy aunt.

482
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:37,084
I got into an argument
with my girlfriend.

483
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:40,205
She said to me,
"You treat this house like a hotel."

484
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,604
I said, "I have never

485
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:44,965
snorted cocaine off a hooker's tits
in this house."

486
00:26:48,645 --> 00:26:51,245
That is a joke.
I have never paid for sex.

487
00:26:51,925 --> 00:26:54,285
Which has upset a lot of prostitutes.

488
00:26:56,325 --> 00:26:57,325
Shane's mum.

489
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:02,524
A couple of weeks ago,

490
00:27:02,525 --> 00:27:04,044
I failed to perform sexually.

491
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:05,284
I won't go into detail.

492
00:27:05,285 --> 00:27:07,925
Suffice it to say, I "arrived early."

493
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:10,084
And my girlfriend said,

494
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:11,644
"Don't worry,
that happens to a lot of men."

495
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:14,565
I said, "Right. A couple of things.
Firstly, who are these 'a lot of men'?

496
00:27:15,365 --> 00:27:17,644
And, secondly, if it's happening
to more than one of us,

497
00:27:17,645 --> 00:27:19,245
don't you think it could be your fault?"

498
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,524
My girlfriend has fallen asleep
during sex before.

499
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:28,525
That is awkward.

500
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:31,085
But not as awkward
as the time she woke up during it.

501
00:27:33,765 --> 00:27:34,805
"Hello, love.

502
00:27:35,925 --> 00:27:37,045
You're up early."

503
00:27:39,485 --> 00:27:42,484
"Yeah, I was just getting on
with a little bit of sex. Yeah.

504
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:44,365
I'll make you a cup of tea
when I'm finished."

505
00:27:45,325 --> 00:27:47,125
That'll help get rid of the taste."

506
00:27:54,885 --> 00:27:57,764
It's a great feeling when you get
a woman you've been chasing for...

507
00:27:57,765 --> 00:27:58,805
miles.

508
00:28:04,085 --> 00:28:05,644
I thought it would be romantic

509
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:08,284
to take my girlfriend back
to where we first met,

510
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:09,324
but she said,

511
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:10,684
"Don't make me go back there, Mr. Jimmy.

512
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:12,245
I'll cook, I'll clean, I'll be better."

513
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,524
I worry about that joke.

514
00:28:19,525 --> 00:28:20,965
Is that just razy lacism?

515
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:27,524
I didn't used to talk about sex at all.

516
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:28,964
I was very repressed, very uptight.

517
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,044
Very British about the whole thing.

518
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:32,204
Now I'll talk to anyone about anything.

519
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:33,124
Here's an example.

520
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,484
Here's a detail from my life
I don't mind sharing

521
00:28:34,485 --> 00:28:35,764
with the good people of Dublin.

522
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:39,284
My girlfriend can't have orgasms
during intercourse,

523
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:40,965
but it's not a problem, because I...

524
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:42,485
can.

525
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:47,124
I gave my girlfriend an orgasm.

526
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,325
She spat it back in my face.

527
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:56,085
I was pretty into it actually, yeah.

528
00:28:57,725 --> 00:29:00,285
When my first girlfriend
choked to death...

529
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:03,165
it was a terrible blow.

530
00:29:05,525 --> 00:29:07,205
Yeah, I had to finish myself off.

531
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,004
I was in bed with a girl recently.

532
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,525
She said to me,
"I want tonight to be magical."

533
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,085
And it was.

534
00:29:15,605 --> 00:29:16,725
After I fucked her...

535
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:18,685
I disappeared.

536
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,084
My girlfriend used to smoke after sex,

537
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:27,645
so we started using lubricant.

538
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,484
Have you all had the classic
bar room conversation,

539
00:29:36,485 --> 00:29:38,284
if you had to sleep with a man,
who would it be?

540
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:40,484
Classic heterosexual male,
bar room conversation.

541
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:41,485
Have you had it?

542
00:29:42,125 --> 00:29:43,724
No? You haven't? Okay.

543
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:45,604
Well, forewarned is forearmed.

544
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:47,804
I'll tell you how the conversation
is meant to go.

545
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:49,524
If you had to sleep with a man,
who would it be?

546
00:29:49,525 --> 00:29:50,524
Johnny Depp.

547
00:29:50,525 --> 00:29:52,844
Johnny Depp, you'd go with. Johnny Depp.

548
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:55,644
<i>Pirates Of The Caribbean,</i>
gorgeous Johnny Depp.

549
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:57,124
That's not how the conversation's
meant to go.

550
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,004
I'll tell you how the conversation's
meant to go.

551
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,804
So you're in a bar, with a friend,

552
00:30:00,805 --> 00:30:02,284
drinking, taking it easy,

553
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:04,324
chatting about life and news and sports.

554
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:06,244
Out of nowhere, your friend says to you,

555
00:30:06,245 --> 00:30:08,284
"If you had to sleep with a man,
who would it be?"

556
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:09,684
"Well, I wouldn't,
so it wouldn't be anyone."

557
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:11,004
"But if you had to, who would it be?"

558
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,244
"Well, I wouldn't,
so it wouldn't be anyone."

559
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,804
"But if you had to sleep with a man,
who would it be?"

560
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:14,924
"Well, I wouldn't,
so it wouldn't be anyone."

561
00:30:14,925 --> 00:30:16,364
"But if you had to."
"I wouldn't."

562
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,884
"But if you had to though."
"I just wouldn't."

563
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,924
"But if you had to sleep with a man."
"I would not sleep with a man."

564
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,964
"But if you had to sleep with a man,
who would that man be?"

565
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:23,484
"I wouldn't sleep with a man."
"But if you had to."

566
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:25,324
"I wouldn't though."
"But if you had to sleep with a man."

567
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:27,164
"I would not sleep with a man."
"But if you had to."

568
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:28,684
"I wouldn't."
"But if you had to though."

569
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:30,524
"I just wouldn't."
"But if you had to, who would it be?"

570
00:30:30,525 --> 00:30:32,324
"I wouldn't, so it wouldn't be anyone."
"But if you had to."

571
00:30:32,325 --> 00:30:33,724
"I wouldn't."
"But if you had to."

572
00:30:33,725 --> 00:30:35,524
"I just wouldn't though."
"But if you had to sleep with a man."

573
00:30:35,525 --> 00:30:36,684
"No."
"But if you had to."

574
00:30:36,685 --> 00:30:38,164
"I wouldn't."
"But if you had to sleep with a man."

575
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:39,284
"I would not sleep with a man."

576
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:40,924
"But if you had to."
"I wouldn't sleep with a man."

577
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:42,604
"But if you had to"
"I wouldn't sleep with a man."

578
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:43,524
"But if you had to."
"I wouldn't."

579
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,044
"If you had to"
"I wouldn't."

580
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,884
"If you had to sleep with a man."
"Well..."

581
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:48,045
"Poof."

582
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:55,325
That's how that conversation's
supposed to go.

583
00:30:57,445 --> 00:30:59,284
It doesn't always go like that.
Of course not.

584
00:30:59,285 --> 00:31:00,964
Sometimes you say, "If you had to sleep
with a man, who would it be?"

585
00:31:00,965 --> 00:31:02,325
and they go, "Johnny Depp."

586
00:31:05,445 --> 00:31:06,804
Don't feel bad about that.

587
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:08,044
Not the worst answer I've ever had.

588
00:31:08,045 --> 00:31:09,884
The worst answer I ever had,
I did a gig in London...

589
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:10,844
and I was picking on this guy

590
00:31:10,845 --> 00:31:12,404
front and center,
where you're sitting, sir,

591
00:31:12,405 --> 00:31:13,644
and he got so flustered,

592
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:15,844
like a deer in the headlights flustered,

593
00:31:15,845 --> 00:31:18,564
I said, "If you had to sleep with a man,
who would it be?" and he went...

594
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:19,565
"My brother."

595
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:27,964
Let's hear from the ladies.

596
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:29,685
Give us a shout,
all the ladies in the room.

597
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,084
You sound in great spirits.

598
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:33,965
Do you think
you're easy to live with, ladies?

599
00:31:35,405 --> 00:31:37,285
Well, this is going to be educational
and fun.

600
00:31:38,725 --> 00:31:41,284
Gonna tell you how easy you are to
live with, with a couple of questions.

601
00:31:41,285 --> 00:31:42,484
First question, ladies.

602
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,085
Have you ever met a gay man?

603
00:31:45,805 --> 00:31:47,044
You have. You've all met gay men.

604
00:31:47,045 --> 00:31:49,884
Have you ever noticed how happy
homosexual men tend to be?

605
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:56,125
How joyful and carefree
those gay dudes tend to be.

606
00:31:56,765 --> 00:31:59,845
"We're going dancing,
Barcardi Breezers. Hiya."

607
00:32:01,005 --> 00:32:02,845
Always in such a great mood.

608
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,205
What's missing from their lives?

609
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:07,485
You.

610
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:20,044
Don't get the wrong idea.
I'm not homophobic.

611
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:22,485
Anyone that says I'm homophobic
can suck my cock.

612
00:32:24,445 --> 00:32:26,205
As long it's not a fella.
It's not natural.

613
00:32:28,645 --> 00:32:30,404
And I think I should be allowed
to tell these jokes,

614
00:32:30,405 --> 00:32:32,644
because although I've never
had sex with a man,

615
00:32:32,645 --> 00:32:34,725
I have fucked a girl ugly enough
to count as a man.

616
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:38,005
Shane's mum.

617
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,445
Sorry, Shane.

618
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:47,044
Have you all had
the sexual history conversation?

619
00:32:47,045 --> 00:32:49,644
It's the conversation that happens about
maybe six months into a relationship

620
00:32:49,645 --> 00:32:51,284
when things are getting
a little bit serious

621
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:53,084
and it tends to be the woman
will ask the man.

622
00:32:53,085 --> 00:32:55,884
She'll say, "I'd like to know
about your sexual history."

623
00:32:55,885 --> 00:32:58,245
And the man will think,
"No, you fucking wouldn't."

624
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:02,004
But in my experience,
the woman doesn't ask once

625
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:03,804
and then move on
if you don't want to answer.

626
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:05,924
She keeps on asking
and asking and asking

627
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:08,044
until eventually you feel like
you have to give an answer.

628
00:33:08,045 --> 00:33:09,644
It's what happened to me.
I was cornered.

629
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:11,444
I had to list everyone
I'd ever been with.

630
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:13,965
From the girl I'd lost my virginity to
right the way up to her.

631
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:16,525
And that is where I should have stopped.

632
00:33:23,245 --> 00:33:25,965
What's the most important thing
in a relationship? What do you think?

633
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,004
Trust.
Dishwasher.

634
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,005
Trust.

635
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:29,365
What, sorry?

636
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:30,684
A dishwasher.

637
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:31,685
A dishwasher.

638
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,725
God, has he even forgotten your name?

639
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,405
He just calls you "The Dishwasher."

640
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:44,885
Any other thoughts?
Most important thing?

641
00:33:45,765 --> 00:33:47,604
What, sorry?
Money.

642
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,405
You think money's
the most important thing.

643
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:51,725
Can I have her washed
and brought to my room?

644
00:33:54,645 --> 00:33:55,645
It's a joke.

645
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:57,245
Don't bother washing her.

646
00:33:58,885 --> 00:34:00,084
There's really no point.

647
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,245
She's going to end up looking
like a plasterer's radio.

648
00:34:08,805 --> 00:34:09,724
I think I'm with you.

649
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:11,604
I think trust is the
most important thing.

650
00:34:11,605 --> 00:34:14,444
Because if you're with a woman
and you don't 100% trust her,

651
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:15,364
how do you know

652
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:16,925
she's not going to tell your wife?

653
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:21,284
Best answer I ever had on that,

654
00:34:21,285 --> 00:34:23,484
I was doing a gig in
Glasgow in Scotland.

655
00:34:23,485 --> 00:34:25,564
I said, "What's the most important thing
in a relationship?"

656
00:34:25,565 --> 00:34:27,365
and a bloke went, "Consent."

657
00:34:33,965 --> 00:34:35,885
Who's drinking tonight?
Are you drinking tonight?

658
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:40,044
I like drinking when it gets
a bit out of hand.

659
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,564
Beyond beer, wine, spirits,
into the crazy drinks

660
00:34:42,565 --> 00:34:45,245
you only order
when you're already hammered drunk.

661
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:48,604
The flaming Sambuca is a prime example.

662
00:34:48,605 --> 00:34:51,284
No-one has ever ordered
a flaming Sambuca while sober

663
00:34:51,285 --> 00:34:52,564
and the reason is clear.

664
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:53,725
It's on fire.

665
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:56,164
It does not look refreshing.

666
00:34:56,165 --> 00:34:57,844
The only possible
reason I could think of

667
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,524
to order a flaming Sambuca when sober

668
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:00,484
is if you're with a woman

669
00:35:00,485 --> 00:35:02,285
and she's something
just a little bit special.

670
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:06,324
She's beautiful, and intelligent,
and kind, and funny

671
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:08,165
and you think,
"Well, she could be the one."

672
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:09,924
But she's got a bit of an issue

673
00:35:09,925 --> 00:35:11,285
with facial hair on the top lip.

674
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15,844
I know, that could be a very awkward
thing to bring up,

675
00:35:15,845 --> 00:35:17,725
especially early on in a relationship.

676
00:35:18,245 --> 00:35:20,526
Much easier, I think,
take her out for a couple of drinks.

677
00:35:21,965 --> 00:35:23,685
"Two flaming sambucas, please,
my good man.

678
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:26,124
No, I know I'm driving.

679
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,925
They're both for you,
my little Fu Manchu."

680
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,844
Some young women drink so much,

681
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:36,524
they black out and can't remember

682
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:37,765
what happened the night before.

683
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:40,124
If that's you, don't worry.

684
00:35:40,125 --> 00:35:41,125
I made a video.

685
00:35:43,405 --> 00:35:45,525
Most people that get cosmetic surgery

686
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,685
are disappointed with the results,
but they look...

687
00:35:48,165 --> 00:35:49,205
pleasantly surprised.

688
00:35:53,645 --> 00:35:56,684
Surely the best thing
about getting a full face transplant...

689
00:35:56,685 --> 00:35:57,604
They can do them now.

690
00:35:57,605 --> 00:35:59,284
Full face transplants.

691
00:35:59,285 --> 00:36:00,604
Surely the best thing about that

692
00:36:00,605 --> 00:36:02,765
would be turning up
at the donor's funeral and going...

693
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:06,644
Ooh.

694
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:10,325
Come on, you would.

695
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:16,204
I've got a new doctor
who is stunningly attractive.

696
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:17,964
Early thirties woman, raven black hair.

697
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:18,924
I mean smoke show.

698
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,404
She's absolutely gorgeous.

699
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:22,724
So the first time I met her,
I was having an appointment

700
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:24,164
in her office, the doctor's office.

701
00:36:24,165 --> 00:36:25,684
So, I walked into the doctor's office,

702
00:36:25,685 --> 00:36:27,484
my jaw hit the floor.

703
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,485
I walked in and went...

704
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:30,365
Alright?

705
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:31,844
She went, "Come in, sit down."

706
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:32,845
I went, "Okay."

707
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:35,725
She said, "It's very nice to meet you."
I went, "Okay."

708
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,965
She said, "Please,
tell me what the problem is."

709
00:36:40,005 --> 00:36:41,325
I said, "I'm embarrassed."

710
00:36:42,005 --> 00:36:43,644
She said, "I've been a doctor for years,

711
00:36:43,645 --> 00:36:44,804
nothing I haven't heard before.

712
00:36:44,805 --> 00:36:47,285
Just tell me what the problem is
and I'm sure we can help you."

713
00:36:47,845 --> 00:36:48,845
I said, "Okay.

714
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:51,325
I think my cock tastes funny.

715
00:36:56,445 --> 00:36:57,924
I don't know if there's a test for that,

716
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,085
but I've had an idea."

717
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:04,844
I think the best holiday I ever went on

718
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:07,324
was the first time I went away
with my mates.

719
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:08,804
Our own choice of destination,

720
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:10,564
our own money, our own passports,

721
00:37:10,565 --> 00:37:12,484
that sense of freedom and adventure.

722
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:13,564
I'll tell you what happened.

723
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,924
We were 18, we finished school,

724
00:37:14,925 --> 00:37:16,844
finished our last exam,
we all got summer jobs,

725
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:18,204
worked the whole summer through

726
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:19,924
and then, the day after the results
came out,

727
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:22,805
we went to Faliraki in Greece
for two weeks.

728
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,524
Sun, sea, sex and sand.

729
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:26,724
That's what we're looking for.

730
00:37:26,725 --> 00:37:28,364
That is what we got.

731
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:29,524
In those two weeks,

732
00:37:29,525 --> 00:37:31,884
I had sex with 12 different people.

733
00:37:31,885 --> 00:37:32,964
I'm not bragging.

734
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:34,085
I was gang raped.

735
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:37,804
You meet the locals.

736
00:37:37,805 --> 00:37:39,245
You see a different culture.

737
00:37:42,925 --> 00:37:44,644
Does anyone know what you're meant to do

738
00:37:44,645 --> 00:37:46,204
if you get stung by a jellyfish?

739
00:37:46,205 --> 00:37:47,164
Does anyone know?

740
00:37:47,165 --> 00:37:48,204
Piss on it.

741
00:37:48,205 --> 00:37:49,524
Piss on it is the right answer.

742
00:37:49,525 --> 00:37:50,564
I'll tell you this much,

743
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:52,765
doesn't work as well on shark bites.

744
00:37:54,445 --> 00:37:56,165
The boy's family were livid.

745
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:00,484
Apparently once they've been dead
a couple of hours,

746
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:01,765
there is very little you can do.

747
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:04,565
No amount of piss is
bringing them round.

748
00:38:05,765 --> 00:38:08,364
Would you like some behind the scenes,
show business,

749
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:09,444
how things are done?

750
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:10,444
Would you like to know?

751
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:12,324
Yes!
Okay, what's a good way to explain?

752
00:38:12,325 --> 00:38:14,244
You know when they're filming
with chimpanzees?

753
00:38:14,245 --> 00:38:15,924
It could be a commercial they're filming

754
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:17,284
or a movie or TV show.

755
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:18,844
When they're filming with chimpanzees,

756
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:21,484
what they do is they give them
peanut butter.

757
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:22,484
It doesn't occur naturally.

758
00:38:22,485 --> 00:38:24,164
It's not in their
regular diet in the zoo.

759
00:38:24,165 --> 00:38:25,244
And the reason they give it to them

760
00:38:25,245 --> 00:38:26,444
is because they're not used to it.

761
00:38:26,445 --> 00:38:28,044
Because when they give them
the peanut butter,

762
00:38:28,045 --> 00:38:30,124
it sticks to the roof
of the chimpanzee's mouth.

763
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:31,444
It makes the chimpanzees go...

764
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:38,565
And it makes it look
like the chimpanzee's talking.

765
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:47,165
Well, that's also how they make
<i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</i>

766
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,244
When I was a kid,
I had an imaginary friend

767
00:38:57,245 --> 00:38:59,044
and I used to think
he went everywhere with me

768
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,324
and that I could talk to him

769
00:39:00,325 --> 00:39:01,324
and he could hear me,

770
00:39:01,325 --> 00:39:03,204
and that he could grant me wishes
and stuff.

771
00:39:03,205 --> 00:39:05,845
And then I grew up
and I stopped going to church.

772
00:39:12,245 --> 00:39:14,324
I know, I'll be sorry

773
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:16,724
when Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior

774
00:39:16,725 --> 00:39:18,525
comes back from the made up.

775
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:24,444
I heard a reporter recently,

776
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,644
a proper BBC journalist on the news,

777
00:39:26,645 --> 00:39:29,965
say, "At least one person killed
in suicide bomb attack."

778
00:39:32,845 --> 00:39:34,325
Well, yeah, obviously.

779
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:37,085
It's the bare minimum
you need to qualify.

780
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:39,924
I've never really understood it.

781
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:42,884
Why would you become an Islamic
fundamentalist suicide bomber

782
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:47,964
on the off-chance you might
get 72 virgins when you die?

783
00:39:47,965 --> 00:39:49,484
Become a Catholic priest

784
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:50,565
and have them now.

785
00:39:51,285 --> 00:39:52,565
Life's for living.

786
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:58,164
I was raised Catholic,

787
00:39:58,165 --> 00:40:00,724
and the thing that annoyed me
about church when I was a kid

788
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:03,285
was all the standing up and sitting down
and kneeling.

789
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:06,525
I wished the priests
could just pick a position and fuck me.

790
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,284
I was in New Zealand on tour.

791
00:40:15,285 --> 00:40:17,444
I got in trouble while I was
in New Zealand over a joke.

792
00:40:17,445 --> 00:40:19,605
I'll tell you the joke.
You can tell me what you think.

793
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:21,005
All I said was this.

794
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:22,644
"I was in Napier.

795
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:26,084
Destroyed by an earthquake, rebuilt,
beautiful town.

796
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:27,364
I was in Christchurch.

797
00:40:27,365 --> 00:40:30,685
Destroyed by an earthquake,
rebuilt, beautiful town.

798
00:40:31,165 --> 00:40:32,165
I was in Dunedin...

799
00:40:32,605 --> 00:40:34,485
I said, 'I'll tell you
what this town needs...'"

800
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,205
They went fucking mental.

801
00:40:45,245 --> 00:40:47,085
It turns out I was on very shaky ground.

802
00:40:51,445 --> 00:40:53,404
One of my best friends,
who's from New Zealand,

803
00:40:53,405 --> 00:40:56,044
I asked him how many sexual partners
he'd had in his life

804
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:57,045
and he started to count.

805
00:40:57,565 --> 00:40:58,565
And he fell asleep.

806
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:05,326
Because the men from New Zealand
sometimes fuck the sheep.

807
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,044
Also, if you had quite mild insomnia,

808
00:41:10,045 --> 00:41:11,844
that might encourage you to count sheep

809
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,564
and the repetitive nature of such a task

810
00:41:13,565 --> 00:41:15,085
might help you drift off to sleep.

811
00:41:15,965 --> 00:41:17,884
What jokes are essentially
is two stories,

812
00:41:17,885 --> 00:41:19,164
and, in the first story,

813
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:21,804
you're forced to make an assumption
that turns out to be erroneous.

814
00:41:21,805 --> 00:41:23,684
In the second part of the story,
or punchline,

815
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:25,964
it's the sudden revelation
of a previously concealed fact.

816
00:41:25,965 --> 00:41:27,284
They all work in a similar way.

817
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,566
It's probably easiest
if you just join in with the others.

818
00:41:35,485 --> 00:41:36,564
My girlfriend often says,

819
00:41:36,565 --> 00:41:38,284
"You never tell me
how much you love me."

820
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:39,325
I don't want to upset her.

821
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:44,284
I've been with the same girl
for 18 years.

822
00:41:44,285 --> 00:41:46,684
She still gets annoyed
if I use her toothbrush.

823
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:47,685
That's crazy, isn't it?

824
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,084
Yes.

825
00:41:49,085 --> 00:41:50,404
You don't think that's crazy?

826
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:52,844
If you can tell me a better way
to get dog shit out of shoes,

827
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:53,885
I'd love to hear about it.

828
00:41:57,085 --> 00:41:58,964
I'm in a long-term relationship,

829
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,284
but I'm not married.

830
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:01,565
Is anyone else in the same boat?

831
00:42:03,005 --> 00:42:04,004
A few of us.

832
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,564
You probably don't want to say,
a lot of you,

833
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,925
because people are dicks about it.

834
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:09,044
I'll introduce my girlfriend
to someone at a party.

835
00:42:09,045 --> 00:42:11,364
People we don't know, they'll find out
how long we've been together,

836
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,484
and immediately,
perfect strangers going to me,

837
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:14,764
"Have you thought about...

838
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:15,964
You two, thought about...

839
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:17,524
Ever thought about? Ever talked about?

840
00:42:17,525 --> 00:42:18,764
Ever thought about you two...

841
00:42:18,765 --> 00:42:20,604
Ever thought about? Ever talked about?"

842
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,204
They're not politely inquiring.

843
00:42:22,205 --> 00:42:24,525
They're trying to stir up a fight
between me and my girl.

844
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:26,884
Well, fuck that noise.

845
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:28,684
So if ever I get the,
"You ever thought about..."

846
00:42:28,685 --> 00:42:30,725
I always think,
"What? Putting a third finger in?

847
00:42:34,245 --> 00:42:35,525
I'll give it a go.

848
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:38,364
I'm not sure
if it's what the relationship's missing,

849
00:42:38,365 --> 00:42:39,405
but I'll bloody try it.

850
00:42:40,285 --> 00:42:41,285
Thanks, vicar."

851
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:46,285
Maybe try the shocker.

852
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:50,085
Two in the pink, one in the stink.
That's how that works.

853
00:42:50,925 --> 00:42:52,044
Sorry, you're only young.

854
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:53,645
Two in the goo, one in the poo. There.

855
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:02,204
I bought my girlfriend lingerie

856
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,564
for the first time just last Christmas.

857
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:05,604
So 18 years in...

858
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:06,924
I didn't do it the first couple years

859
00:43:06,925 --> 00:43:08,084
and then it became a big deal in my head

860
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,204
and I didn't want to get it wrong.

861
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:11,884
So last November,
we were wandering through Soho

862
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:13,844
and, as we walked past
Agent Provocateur,

863
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:16,284
this very fancy lingerie store,

864
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:18,684
as we walked by,
my girlfriend looked up at a mannequin

865
00:43:18,685 --> 00:43:20,444
and there was a bra and panties
on the mannequin

866
00:43:20,445 --> 00:43:21,644
and she went, "They're nice."

867
00:43:21,645 --> 00:43:22,724
Very unlike her.

868
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,604
So the next day, I went back,

869
00:43:24,605 --> 00:43:26,645
bought the bra and panties
that she said were nice.

870
00:43:26,765 --> 00:43:30,004
They came in this beautiful
presentation, velvet-lined box,

871
00:43:30,005 --> 00:43:32,084
and they were pinned
to the back of the box,

872
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:33,844
beautifully displayed for Christmas.

873
00:43:33,845 --> 00:43:35,244
Quite expensive, but very nice.

874
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:37,724
Anyway, Christmas morning rolls round
a month later.

875
00:43:37,725 --> 00:43:39,124
She's forgotten about the whole thing.

876
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,164
She opens up the box.

877
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:42,125
She was absolutely thrilled. She went...

878
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,205
"These are beautiful, darling.

879
00:43:45,645 --> 00:43:46,845
But they're not my size."

880
00:43:47,685 --> 00:43:49,884
I said, "Don't worry, I've had
a chat with the lady in the shop

881
00:43:49,885 --> 00:43:50,964
and she says

882
00:43:50,965 --> 00:43:52,405
you can have an operation."

883
00:43:59,045 --> 00:44:01,084
"Those bra and panties,
that's like Cinderella's slipper.

884
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,685
That will fit the woman I want."

885
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:09,804
To keep things fresh in the bedroom,
we do a little bit of role play.

886
00:44:09,805 --> 00:44:11,965
I'd recommend it
if you're in a long-term relationship.

887
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:15,244
How it works is she
pretends to be a nurse

888
00:44:15,245 --> 00:44:16,604
and I pretend...

889
00:44:16,605 --> 00:44:18,165
I'm still attracted to her.

890
00:44:21,605 --> 00:44:23,205
That's divided the room, hasn't it?

891
00:44:24,285 --> 00:44:25,924
There's people that thought
that was funny,

892
00:44:25,925 --> 00:44:27,445
and then there are unattractive women.

893
00:44:31,885 --> 00:44:34,084
My girlfriend likes to have
the lights on during sex,

894
00:44:34,085 --> 00:44:36,365
because she likes to be able to read.

895
00:44:39,165 --> 00:44:41,925
Which I think is to be encouraged
in a girl of that age.

896
00:44:50,525 --> 00:44:52,644
I'm not in favor
of all kinds of group sex.

897
00:44:52,645 --> 00:44:55,444
I'm not in favor of the two guys,
one girl threesome,

898
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:56,684
for the simple reason,

899
00:44:56,685 --> 00:44:59,485
I never want to see
another man's happy face.

900
00:45:00,725 --> 00:45:02,124
Because women, when they orgasm,

901
00:45:02,125 --> 00:45:03,444
look beautiful and serene.

902
00:45:03,445 --> 00:45:05,725
I've seen it in magazines and films.

903
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,324
Men, when they orgasm,

904
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:13,165
look as if they're
drinking vinegar through their eyes.

905
00:45:17,765 --> 00:45:19,725
Jesus, dude,
you're like a turtle shitting.

906
00:45:20,365 --> 00:45:21,365
Sorry.

907
00:45:25,285 --> 00:45:28,084
I told my girlfriend
my ultimate sexual fantasy

908
00:45:28,085 --> 00:45:29,845
was to have two women
at the same time

909
00:45:30,165 --> 00:45:31,364
and she agreed.

910
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:33,925
But then she was livid when I told her
she wasn't either of them.

911
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:39,084
I did have a threesome once,
many years ago.

912
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:40,804
I was in my mid-20s,
I was seeing this girl,

913
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:42,404
not that serious a relationship,

914
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:44,564
but it transpired she had a twin.

915
00:45:44,565 --> 00:45:46,724
So I asked.
You don't ask, you don't get.

916
00:45:46,725 --> 00:45:47,884
There's a lesson in life.

917
00:45:47,885 --> 00:45:49,724
I asked, I got, and I'm glad I did.

918
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:51,245
It was fucking awesome.

919
00:45:52,045 --> 00:45:54,444
Because, if anything,
her twin was better looking than her

920
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:56,805
and an all-round great guy.

921
00:46:01,405 --> 00:46:03,485
Yeah, you knew something was coming.

922
00:46:04,565 --> 00:46:06,965
But you didn't know
it was going to be her brother in her.

923
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:19,004
Sometimes, you can sense that a friend
wants to take things further.

924
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:20,204
Will it ruin the friendship?

925
00:46:20,205 --> 00:46:22,004
Things get hot and heavy
on the sofa one night.

926
00:46:22,005 --> 00:46:23,364
You think, "This doesn't feel right,

927
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:24,484
you're my best friend.

928
00:46:24,485 --> 00:46:26,005
You're not even allowed on the couch."

929
00:46:29,165 --> 00:46:30,485
"Bad dog! Down, boy."

930
00:46:32,325 --> 00:46:33,645
I didn't fuck a dog.

931
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,125
We made love.

932
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,524
Men over-promise in the bedroom.

933
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:43,444
Not just me.

934
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:44,764
I think all men are guilty.

935
00:46:44,765 --> 00:46:47,645
Men are full of the... "I'm going to
make love to you all night long."

936
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:49,765
Are we though?

937
00:46:50,605 --> 00:46:51,964
Really?

938
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:53,644
Like every man in this room,

939
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:56,484
the only time I've ever wanted
to have sex twice

940
00:46:56,485 --> 00:46:58,765
is before I've had sex once.

941
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,844
"I'm going to make love to you
all night long.

942
00:47:05,845 --> 00:47:07,645
Or, until I get sleepy."

943
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,085
"Let's see which comes first."

944
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:13,445
"I came first."

945
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:16,125
"Night night."

946
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,524
You look like
a ventriloquist's doll.

947
00:47:21,525 --> 00:47:23,805
What's it like to get fisted by men?

948
00:47:26,325 --> 00:47:28,764
So that was I look like
a ventriloquist's doll,

949
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:29,684
and then you add...

950
00:47:29,685 --> 00:47:30,885
That's insulting enough.

951
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:34,565
And then you added
because I like to get fisted by men.

952
00:47:42,845 --> 00:47:44,164
If you want my comeback,

953
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:46,205
you'll have to scrape it
off your mum's teeth.

954
00:47:51,885 --> 00:47:52,965
You posh cunt.

955
00:47:55,445 --> 00:47:58,245
A lot of people think I'm posh.
I'm not that posh. Who thinks I'm posh?

956
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:01,965
Well, compared to you, yes, but...

957
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:05,004
I'm not as posh as people think.

958
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:08,005
I went to one of the roughest colleges
in Cambridge.

959
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:12,124
I've got a question
just for the ladies in the room.

960
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,244
All women I know
have got a very clear line.

961
00:48:14,245 --> 00:48:16,724
On one side of the line, things
they're happy, comfortable, confident

962
00:48:16,725 --> 00:48:18,484
and enjoy doing sexually
with a loving partner.

963
00:48:18,485 --> 00:48:21,284
On the other side of the line,
things they've been asked to do by a man

964
00:48:21,285 --> 00:48:24,044
that they said,
"No, that is not happening."

965
00:48:24,045 --> 00:48:25,684
What I would like to know, ladies,

966
00:48:25,685 --> 00:48:28,204
what is the weirdest thing
you've been asked to do by a man?

967
00:48:28,205 --> 00:48:29,684
What's the weirdest thing
you've been asked to do?

968
00:48:29,685 --> 00:48:32,085
I don't mean reverse park or wash up.
I mean...

969
00:48:33,605 --> 00:48:35,164
Within a sexual context,

970
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,125
what's the weirdest thing
you've been asked to do?

971
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:39,484
Stick a finger in their bum.
"Stick a finger in their bum."

972
00:48:39,485 --> 00:48:41,885
I said, "What's the weirdest thing?"
Maybe you didn't hear.

973
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:44,085
Weirdest thing a man's asked you to do.

974
00:48:44,605 --> 00:48:45,524
Pee on him.

975
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:46,444
Pee on him?

976
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:48,125
Had he been stung by a jellyfish?

977
00:48:50,925 --> 00:48:52,684
He wanted you to do a wee on him?

978
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:54,564
Now, how long had you been with the guy

979
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,324
before he said,
"Would you mind doing a wee on me?"

980
00:48:56,325 --> 00:48:58,205
Twenty minutes.
Twenty minutes?

981
00:49:04,645 --> 00:49:07,245
I'm not sure you weren't
just walking past a tramp, love.

982
00:49:13,005 --> 00:49:15,404
Any other interesting ones?

983
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:17,365
Anyone been asked to do anything weird,
ladies?

984
00:49:17,925 --> 00:49:18,844
Be a dog.

985
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:19,804
What, sorry?

986
00:49:19,805 --> 00:49:21,285
Whoa, shut up!

987
00:49:22,245 --> 00:49:24,124
This sounds very interesting.
What was that?

988
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,324
Be a dog.

989
00:49:25,325 --> 00:49:26,605
Did you say, "Be a dog"?

990
00:49:27,085 --> 00:49:28,085
Yes.

991
00:49:28,405 --> 00:49:30,285
What did that involve?
What did you have to do?

992
00:49:32,285 --> 00:49:33,725
A collar and a leash.

993
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:36,365
You had to wear a collar and a leash?

994
00:49:38,405 --> 00:49:39,525
And be a dog?

995
00:49:41,245 --> 00:49:42,325
Man's best friend.

996
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:46,605
What did he say?
"I'm going to give you a bone."

997
00:49:49,605 --> 00:49:50,884
I'm not expecting more answers.

998
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:53,365
This is just my favorite
bit of the show.

999
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,085
Because I enjoy looking at nervous men.

1000
00:49:58,525 --> 00:50:00,204
I can see men...
I can see you out there, sir.

1001
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,484
I can see you with your hand
on your partner's leg.

1002
00:50:01,485 --> 00:50:03,725
What are you applying?
200-300 pounds' worth of pressure?

1003
00:50:06,485 --> 00:50:08,044
You haven't said anything to her,
have you?

1004
00:50:08,045 --> 00:50:10,605
You just gave her a look
that said, "Shut your fucking mouth."

1005
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,764
"I just wanted to try it.
It's only a finger.

1006
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:14,765
It doesn't make me gay."

1007
00:50:20,405 --> 00:50:23,764
I've got a theory about sex
within long-term relationships.

1008
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:25,844
Because the received
wisdom in our society

1009
00:50:25,845 --> 00:50:27,164
is that men ask for sex.

1010
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:29,324
It's the man that says to the woman,
"Do you want to go upstairs

1011
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,404
for a bit of how's-your-father,
a bit of slap and tickle,

1012
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:32,725
a bit of sticky belly?"

1013
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:36,005
It's a medical term.

1014
00:50:37,485 --> 00:50:40,004
The idea that men have got a sex drive
and women are merely passive.

1015
00:50:40,005 --> 00:50:42,524
I call bullshit,
I reckon it's about 50-50

1016
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:45,004
in most heterosexual relationships,
asking for sex.

1017
00:50:45,005 --> 00:50:47,724
But the reason you don't notice as much
when women ask for sex

1018
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:50,404
is because, when women ask for sex
in a long-term relationship,

1019
00:50:50,405 --> 00:50:51,405
it happens.

1020
00:50:53,045 --> 00:50:54,765
She doesn't have to ask twice.

1021
00:50:55,765 --> 00:50:57,804
Trust me,
if you've been with a woman for 18 years

1022
00:50:57,805 --> 00:50:59,564
and she says,
"Do you want to go upstairs and fuck?"

1023
00:50:59,565 --> 00:51:00,565
"Yep."

1024
00:51:01,565 --> 00:51:03,324
It doesn't matter what else is going on.

1025
00:51:03,325 --> 00:51:04,804
You could be full of flu.

1026
00:51:04,805 --> 00:51:05,805
"Yep."

1027
00:51:06,565 --> 00:51:08,885
You could have just received
devastating news.

1028
00:51:09,125 --> 00:51:10,125
"Yep.

1029
00:51:11,325 --> 00:51:12,405
I'll call them back."

1030
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:16,285
You could have just been shot in the leg
by her.

1031
00:51:17,645 --> 00:51:19,205
"Come on. We'll talk about this after."

1032
00:51:21,125 --> 00:51:22,204
But, as a man,

1033
00:51:22,205 --> 00:51:24,804
sometimes you'll proposition the love
of your life, the woman you live with.

1034
00:51:24,805 --> 00:51:27,086
You'll say, "Shall we do the bad thing?"
She'll say, "No."

1035
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,764
And then she'll give you some mercurial,
strange reason

1036
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:32,565
as to why you couldn't possibly have sex
at this moment in time.

1037
00:51:33,245 --> 00:51:34,844
And then you can't think
of a counter argument

1038
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:37,205
because all the blood is somewhere else
so you can't focus.

1039
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:41,964
So I thought, why don't we workshop it?

1040
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,765
What reasons have you heard,
gentlemen, for not having sex?

1041
00:51:47,925 --> 00:51:49,645
She has to pick
Shane up from school.

1042
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:52,405
"She had to pick Shane up from school."

1043
00:51:59,405 --> 00:52:00,405
Very good.

1044
00:52:01,405 --> 00:52:02,444
Shane,

1045
00:52:02,445 --> 00:52:05,125
it would appear you're getting
fucking rinsed on Netflix, my friend.

1046
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:08,405
Hope you're cool with that.

1047
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:11,924
Any other reasons for not having sex,
gentlemen?

1048
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:13,004
What else have you heard?

1049
00:52:13,005 --> 00:52:13,964
Headache.

1050
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:16,124
Headache. Classic.
Easy to deal with as well.

1051
00:52:16,125 --> 00:52:18,124
If a woman says, "I can't have sex,
I've got a headache,"

1052
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:20,125
just say,
"I'll be right at the other end.

1053
00:52:21,925 --> 00:52:24,085
I literally couldn't be further away
from that problem.

1054
00:52:25,245 --> 00:52:27,364
Also, I'm fucking you.
We're not doing Sudoku.

1055
00:52:27,365 --> 00:52:29,525
You're not going to need
your wits about you for this."

1056
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:33,004
We might be overheard.

1057
00:52:33,005 --> 00:52:34,604
You might be overheard?

1058
00:52:34,605 --> 00:52:36,404
You're worried about making noise.
Yeah.

1059
00:52:36,405 --> 00:52:38,124
Stick around after the show, sir.

1060
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:39,844
I could teach you
how to make love to a woman

1061
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:41,604
so the loudest she's going to be is...

1062
00:52:41,605 --> 00:52:42,605
Hmm.

1063
00:52:49,005 --> 00:52:50,164
Possibly an, "Is it in yet?,"

1064
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:51,845
but nothing that's going
to wake anyone up.

1065
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:55,964
Any other... What, sorry?
Tired.

1066
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,764
Tired is probably the most common
these days.

1067
00:52:57,765 --> 00:53:00,285
I think if a woman says she's tired,
you've got to listen.

1068
00:53:00,565 --> 00:53:01,564
You've got to acknowledge.

1069
00:53:01,565 --> 00:53:03,044
Feedback,
so she knows she's been heard.

1070
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:04,524
And then make a suggestion.

1071
00:53:04,525 --> 00:53:05,764
I know that sounds obvious,

1072
00:53:05,765 --> 00:53:08,724
but there's a huge difference
between making a suggestion to a woman

1073
00:53:08,725 --> 00:53:10,404
and making a demand on a woman.

1074
00:53:10,405 --> 00:53:11,364
Make a suggestion.

1075
00:53:11,365 --> 00:53:12,684
If she wants to go with it, great.

1076
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:14,204
If not, you've got to respect that.

1077
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:15,964
So if a woman said to me,
"I can't have sex.

1078
00:53:15,965 --> 00:53:17,125
I'm really tired,"

1079
00:53:17,645 --> 00:53:19,404
I'd say, "Well, of course, you're tired.

1080
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:20,405
I hear you."

1081
00:53:21,725 --> 00:53:23,924
"You've got the house.
You've got the kids. You've got work.

1082
00:53:23,925 --> 00:53:25,084
You must be exhausted, love.

1083
00:53:25,085 --> 00:53:27,204
So why don't you,
and it's just a suggestion,

1084
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:29,564
but why don't you
do what you normally do

1085
00:53:29,565 --> 00:53:31,005
and just fucking lie there?"

1086
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:36,205
"You lazy fucking cow."

1087
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:42,684
Any other excuses for not having sex?

1088
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:43,844
On the blob.

1089
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,845
"On the blob."

1090
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:48,285
Mr. Darcy's in, ladies.

1091
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:55,085
Yeah, part of life, isn't it?
You know, period, menstruation.

1092
00:53:55,645 --> 00:53:56,805
She's up on bricks.

1093
00:53:57,885 --> 00:53:59,365
The decorators are in.

1094
00:54:00,125 --> 00:54:01,685
Liverpool are playing at home.

1095
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:04,124
She's got the red devil in her belly.

1096
00:54:04,125 --> 00:54:05,924
Aunt Flow has come to stay.

1097
00:54:05,925 --> 00:54:07,565
She's at the Women's Institute...

1098
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:09,165
making jam.

1099
00:54:10,725 --> 00:54:11,845
It's shark week.

1100
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:18,124
Or, as most modern women
these days prefer to say,

1101
00:54:18,125 --> 00:54:19,205
on the blob.

1102
00:54:22,765 --> 00:54:25,044
If a woman said to me,
"I can't have sex, I've got my period,"

1103
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:26,965
I would say, "Well,
your arse isn't bleeding...

1104
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,125
yet."

1105
00:54:35,685 --> 00:54:38,524
What I'd like to do now
is torpedo this gig

1106
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,445
with some very edgy jokes.

1107
00:54:41,045 --> 00:54:42,764
So then you can all leave thinking,

1108
00:54:42,765 --> 00:54:44,205
"Thank fuck that's over."

1109
00:54:45,245 --> 00:54:46,325
You're welcome.

1110
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:49,165
Strap in, everyone. Let's do this.

1111
00:54:56,365 --> 00:54:59,564
I saw the chief
of the New York City Police on the news.

1112
00:54:59,565 --> 00:55:01,684
He said, "We will never forget 9/11."

1113
00:55:01,685 --> 00:55:04,165
I thought, "I should fucking hope not,
it's your phone number."

1114
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,644
Islamic fundamentalist sex dolls.

1115
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,285
Do they blow themselves up?

1116
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,284
If my grandmother knew how much money

1117
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:24,325
I spent on her funeral, she would be...

1118
00:55:24,805 --> 00:55:26,525
spinning in her ditch.

1119
00:55:34,325 --> 00:55:37,444
It always feels so much better
when you have a wank with a dead arm,

1120
00:55:37,445 --> 00:55:39,445
but apparently, I ruined that funeral.

1121
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:49,804
I was in a strip club,
I saw a girl do a thing with a bottle.

1122
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,005
I was disgusted.

1123
00:55:51,485 --> 00:55:53,045
Red wine with fish?

1124
00:55:57,805 --> 00:56:00,845
Throwing acid is wrong
in some people's eyes.

1125
00:56:06,205 --> 00:56:07,604
I saw a headline in the paper.

1126
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:10,325
It said, "Man held after rape."
I thought...

1127
00:56:10,965 --> 00:56:12,165
"They cuddled?"

1128
00:56:16,765 --> 00:56:18,844
I actually bought a rape alarm.

1129
00:56:18,845 --> 00:56:20,765
Because I kept on forgetting
when to rape people.

1130
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:26,644
Is it wrong... You be the judge.

1131
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:30,765
Is it wrong to call the disabled seating
area of a theater "the cabbage patch"?

1132
00:56:34,765 --> 00:56:37,164
Say what you like
about the Make-A-Wish Foundation,

1133
00:56:37,165 --> 00:56:38,604
they can work to a deadline.

1134
00:56:42,925 --> 00:56:45,604
That's an unfortunate response
from some of you,

1135
00:56:45,605 --> 00:56:48,845
because that joke is only there
to warm you up for this joke.

1136
00:56:51,605 --> 00:56:54,524
I think the Make-A-Wish Foundation
should be forced to change their name

1137
00:56:54,525 --> 00:56:56,044
from the Make-A-Wish Foundation

1138
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,604
to the "No, Make Another Wish,

1139
00:56:57,605 --> 00:56:59,925
We Can't Do Anything
About That" Foundation.

1140
00:57:07,685 --> 00:57:08,685
I know.

1141
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,284
If only Africa had more mosquito nets,

1142
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:15,605
than every year we
could save millions...

1143
00:57:16,085 --> 00:57:18,405
of mosquitoes
from dying needlessly of AIDS.

1144
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:29,404
It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Thank you very much indeed.

1145
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,405
I appreciate it. That's my show.
Cheers, goodnight.
