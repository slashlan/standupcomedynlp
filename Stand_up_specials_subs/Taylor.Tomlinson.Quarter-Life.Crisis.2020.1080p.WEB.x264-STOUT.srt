8
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,387
Wow! I hope my ex sees this. Thank you.

9
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,308
Oh, my gosh.
Thank you so much for coming.

10
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,477
This is amazing. How are you? Good?

11
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,228
Okay, I'm sorry. That was so aggressive.

12
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,315
There's so many people.
I did not need to single you out that way.

13
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,400
I would hate that
if someone did it to me.

14
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,569
I'm an introvert.
Is anyone else an introvert?

15
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,449
All right. That was a test,
and you failed. Uh...

16
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:18,661
No introvert's ever gone "woo!"
at any decibel.

17
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,123
Real introverts are parked outside going,

18
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,626
"Is it even worth it?
I don't know who she is."

19
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,632
Here's how much of an introvert I am.
Recently, I read a statistic that said,

20
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,134
in 80% of homicide cases,

21
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,845
the killer was someone the victim knew.

22
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,766
When I read that, I was relieved.

23
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:46,439
Like, thank God. I don't want to get
murdered <i>and</i> meet somebody.

24
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,399
That's a lot for a Friday,

25
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,777
getting stabbed and acquainted.

26
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,781
Just dump me in the river.
Don't introduce yourself, Jeff.

27
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,203
So glad you guys are doing well.

28
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,286
I'm doing okay.

29
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:05,125
I am halfway through my 20s,
and I am done with this shit.

30
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,877
Oh, my God! I'm sick of my 20s.

31
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,921
I'm so sick of people
telling me to enjoy them.

32
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,715
They're not fun.
They are ten years of asking yourself,

33
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,635
"Will I outgrow this, or is it a problem?"

34
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,723
Like, is this a phase or a demon?
I just need to know.

35
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,976
Like, am I fun,
or should I go to a meeting?

36
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,060
Someone help me.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,856
And people get upset when I complain
about being young.

38
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,358
I had a woman come up to me after a show
furious. She's like,

39
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,235
"You should appreciate
this time of your life

40
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,279
'cause someday you're gonna have
a family like me,

41
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,030
and you're really gonna miss it."

42
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,495
I'm like, "Where are your kids buried?
Holy shit."

43
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,625
I'm just trying to get to my car,
Ghost of Christmas Future.

44
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,673
If you're sitting there going, "Taylor,
you <i>should </i>be grateful. I miss my 20s."

45
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,801
No, you don't. What you miss is a time
in your life where you didn't have

46
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,471
a lot of responsibilities because nobody
expected anything from you.

47
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:05,268
But do you remember <i>why</i>
nobody expected anything from you?

48
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,104
Because you sucked.

49
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,900
That's what everybody forgets
about your 20s. You were garbage.

50
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,319
Thinner garbage, but you were garbage.

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,742
You have no intuition, no instincts.
You can't make decisions, only mistakes.

52
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,036
That's why you're thin in your 20s.

53
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:26,331
You don't have a gut to listen to yet.

54
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,460
There's no mystic bad feeling
under your ribs going,

55
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,045
"Hey, maybe don't date a DJ...

56
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,128
again."

57
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,760
Nobody expects me to do shit right.

58
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,887
I'm like,
"What can I bring to the potluck, Nana?"

59
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,139
She's like,
"Napkins. Can you handle that?

60
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,184
Dry ones this time.

61
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,231
And if they say Starbucks on them,
I swear to God, Taylor...

62
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,025
Go to a Dollar Tree. Stop ruining Easter."

63
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,781
I've been doing a lot of work on myself.

64
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,368
You have to work on yourself in your 20s
'cause if you don't, then you'll turn 30,

65
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:06,371
and all the shitty parts
of your personality will solidify,

66
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,289
and that'll just be who you are now.

67
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,545
Your 20s are an opportunity to fish trash
out of the lake before it freezes over.

68
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,760
It's like, ooh, what's that? Codependency?

69
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,013
Daddy issues? All right.
Better get all that out of there

70
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,640
'cause winter is coming.

71
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,355
I've done so much work on myself
in the last five years.

72
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,941
I quit dating losers. That took a minute.

73
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,901
Yeah. Thank you.

74
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,985
Thank you.

75
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,572
There's no rehab for that, only sponsors.

76
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:42,657
Uh...

77
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,160
Losers are hard to quit.
Losers are a lot like cigarettes.

78
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,014
You have one in your mouth, you feel
pretty cool, but everyone is like,

79
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,540
"Ew! We're sad for you.

80
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,128
Don't do that around my kids."

81
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,466
All my friends are like,
"You need a guy with a car and a job."

82
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,928
And I'm like, "But then I've got to
deal with his wife. It's a whole thing."

83
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,936
I'm trying to be a better partner too.
I haven't always been a great partner.

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,355
I dated one guy,
on again, off again, for four years.

85
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,816
I would dump him, get back together,
dump him, get together.

86
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,068
I was the girl you couldn't bring home
for holidays

87
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,821
'cause what are you going to say
at that point? Like, "Mom, Dad,

88
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,199
this is my lesson
that I can't seem to learn.

89
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,123
Don't get attached."

90
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,670
He and I broke up
because he cheated on me.

91
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,131
In my head, and I could not...

92
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,931
Sorry, if you love me,
you wouldn't even do it up here. Like...

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,601
You wouldn't even put yourself
in that situation.

94
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,939
I read too many of those
"signs he's cheating" articles.

95
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,903
Have you read those?
They're all the same. Like,

96
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,568
"Oh, did he buy you flowers?

97
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,988
He feels guilty.

98
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,658
Oh, did he call you 'babe'?

99
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,787
He doesn't know your name.

100
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,249
Was he nice to your family?

101
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,919
He slept with your mom."

102
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,127
He never cheated on me,
but he did do this weird thing

103
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:28,721
where he would let me know
any time other women hit on him.

104
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,566
He'd go out of his way to be like,
"Babe, I just want to let you know,

105
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,268
girl at Starbucks
tried to give me her number, so..."

106
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,272
And I'm like, "Cool.

107
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,067
What do you want me to say?
You want me to fist-bump you?

108
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,778
Like, 'Nice, bro. Get it.' Like...

109
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,574
You want me to get jealous?
Turn into Batman?

110
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,535
Like, 'Where is she?' Like, what?"

111
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,789
He's like, "No, I'm trying to be honest
with you 'cause I love you.

112
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,083
That's what I'm doing.
I'm being honest with you."

113
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,501
I'm like, "No, you're not.

114
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:03,297
You want me to know that you turned down
the option of other people today.

115
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,551
You want points for not cheating on me."

116
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,178
Like I'm supposed to swoon or something,
like,

117
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,805
"Oh, my God, babe.

118
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:16,310
You honored the most basic
term of our agreement?"

119
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,572
"I'm so lucky. This is like a fairy tale.

120
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:32,452
I never understood Taylor Swift songs
before, and now I do. Like...

121
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,080
I thank you so much.
I know you have a lot of options..."

122
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:40,001
I turned into Southwest Airlines. "I know
you have a lot of options when you fly.

123
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,671
Thank you for choosing us.
Can we get you anything else?"

124
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,635
I was so pissed. "Do you have
any idea how easy it would be for me

125
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,014
to cheat on you?
Do you know how many holes I have in me?

126
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,767
I take this slice of Swiss cheese
for a walk around the block,

127
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,436
it's over for you, dude."

128
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,732
Yeah.

129
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,279
"I don't even have to try that hard.
I've just got to raise my hand

130
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,865
in a Walmart
or uncross my legs in a Denny's

131
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,659
and we are open for business, all right?"

132
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,038
Just like, "Boom!
Got your Grand Slam right here, fellas.

133
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,121
Line it up.

134
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,875
Mama has a point to make."

135
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,550
The real reason he and I broke up
is the reason everybody breaks up.

136
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,470
We were no longer having
the amount of sex you need to have

137
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,515
in order to ignore
everything that's wrong with each other.

138
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,308
Yeah, love is blind.

139
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,310
Lust is Helen Keller. So...

140
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,608
We weren't there anymore,
and it got tough

141
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,360
because I have a fairly high sex drive.

142
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:51,072
Not crazy high. Not like "I'mma
catch something at the bus station" high.

143
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,248
But if I love you,

144
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,333
diarrhea doesn't deter me.

145
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,416
We're...

146
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,547
We're in <i>that </i>zone, you know? It's like,

147
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,008
"Your stomach hurts? Push through it.
I want to feel close to you."

148
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,053
Mentally push, not physically.
Don't make a mess.

149
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,725
That joke makes me sound so much cooler
than I am. I'm not that cool.

150
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,954
I've had sex with two people,
four if you're Christian.

151
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,312
Like, I'm not a good time.

152
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm not.

153
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,817
I don't like casual sex.
My friends are like,

154
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,060
"You don't know if you like it.
You've never tried it."

155
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,614
I've also never tried cottage cheese,
and I know that shit looks nasty.

156
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,659
It's all wet and bumpy.
I don't trust it, okay?

157
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,995
I had a friend try to convince me
with this argument:

158
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,790
"You have to try it, Taylor,
because there is nothing as empowering

159
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,626
as just banging some guy and leaving."
I'm like,

160
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,712
"That sounds good, but I don't know.

161
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,506
Have you ever tried to make a dude's mom

162
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,592
love <i>you </i>more than him?"

163
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,718
That is power.

164
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,679
I still talk to Sheila, so...

165
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,661
Haven't heard from him in eight years,

166
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,936
but every Christmas she's like,
"I miss you."

167
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,067
I was very sheltered growing up.

168
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,403
I was terrified of sex.
I thought I would be bad at it.

169
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,698
Now that I'm older,
it's so easy to be good at sex, isn't it?

170
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,784
All you have to do is approach it
with the enthusiasm of a child.

171
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:21,412
Just put everything in your mouth. Like...

172
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,917
If you can reach it and it fits,
that's where it goes.

173
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,002
Uh...

174
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,173
Pretend you're four and your partner's
made of LEGOs. It's not...

175
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,634
It's not complicated.

176
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,055
I grew up very religious,

177
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:43,809
so I was encouraged to abstain from drugs
and alcohol and sex and enjoyment...

178
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:44,893
and uh...

179
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:49,398
Yeah, being abstinent is when you wait
until marriage to have sex.

180
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,151
They used to tell us,
"The safest sex is no sex."

181
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,488
Which is a lot like saying,
"The safest travel is books."

182
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,077
When I have a daughter,

183
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,454
I'm going to make sure
she's abstinent in high school

184
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,290
and probably before that,
while we're at it, because...

185
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:13,130
When I was younger and I was abstinent,
I was not having sex,

186
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:17,551
but I was having other things done to me,
and I don't know if you know this,

187
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:21,430
but "other things" are kind of
the best part of sex for ladies.

188
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:27,228
So while my friends were having sex,
I was the only one having orgasms.

189
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,105
Yeah.

190
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,318
I could not believe it when I found out.

191
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,696
My friends are like,
"Yeah, me and Chad have had sex,

192
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,906
but I've never, you know..." And I'm like,

193
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,035
"You're going to hell
and you didn't even finish?

194
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,919
I'll pray for you."

195
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,095
First time I tried to lose my virginity,
I missed.

196
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,264
That happen to anybody else in here?

197
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,307
Not physically. I wasn't stupid.
I wasn't like,

198
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,644
"It's like trying to put a straw
in a Capri Sun." It wasn't like that.

199
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,068
What happened was...

200
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,697
I was waiting until marriage,
or until Jesus came back,

201
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,450
'cause I'm like,
"My dad will like him, right?" And...

202
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,661
I waited, waited, waited.

203
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,582
And then, finally, I tried to lose it
to my boyfriend in college who said,

204
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,000
"No, thank you."

205
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,294
Uh, which was a bit of a curve ball.

206
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,545
Nobody...

207
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:39,133
Nobody told me to expect sexual rejection
as a woman. Nobody prepares you.

208
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,696
From the time you start walking
as a little girl, they're like,

209
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,723
"Hey, everybody wants in there. You gotta
build a perimeter and keep everyone out."

210
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:48,684
I was so busy
trying to keep people out of me,

211
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,395
I never thought
I'd have to talk someone into me.

212
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,318
Men take sexual rejection much easier
'cause they're prepared for it.

213
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,721
From the time they start walking
they're like, "Hey, Brent.

214
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,239
You're a little creepy.
Maybe keep an eye on that.

215
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,413
You're going to need to get consent,
which is a noise she makes,

216
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,956
not a feeling you feel."

217
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,925
But because men are prepared for it,
they bounce back real quick.

218
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,135
They walk around like vacuum salesmen.
Just like,

219
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,513
"Eh, eh? There's another house over here."

220
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,731
My boyfriend was nervous
to have sex with a virgin,

221
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,943
and I was like, "The good news is,
you only have to do it once,

222
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,487
and then guess what? Problem solved."

223
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,908
I felt like a high schooler trying to get
a job at the Gap, just like,

224
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,702
"We really want someone
with retail experience."

225
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:52,456
"Well, how am I supposed to get some
unless someone takes a chance on me?"

226
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,508
I was literally told by somebody

227
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,351
that getting rid of my virginity,
as a woman,

228
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,638
was going to be like handing out
free samples at a Costco, and instead,

229
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,807
I felt like one of those guys
on the Vegas Strip,

230
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,059
trying to hand you a nightclub flyer.
It's like,

231
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,644
"No, come on in. It'll be fun.

232
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,146
There's lights. It's kind of damp.
Get in here.

233
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,525
Ha! It's fun."

234
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,282
But you know what they say:
women go for men like their fathers,

235
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,410
so I keep going for guys
who do not want to sleep with me.

236
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,953
That is...

237
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,581
so like my dad. All right?

238
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:39,044
No reason to be offended. That joke's
about what a great dad my dad is.

239
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:44,925
I lost my virginity late. I lost it
when I was financially independent.

240
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,113
Yeah. I went through my bank statements.
"I could afford to have a dick in me."

241
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,722
Just, like, so responsible.

242
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,559
All my other friends lost it
under a Backstreet Boys poster

243
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,937
in their mom's house,
and I lost it under an IKEA painting

244
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,939
that I purchased...

245
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,442
with a coupon.

246
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,321
But I'm glad I was raised that way

247
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:09,283
because it taught me how to choose
sexual partners in a very responsible way.

248
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,410
Okay? So when I was younger
and I was waiting,

249
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:14,622
I would tell guys, "I'm not ready
to have sex yet. Is that okay?"

250
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,124
Anytime guys were really cool
about that decision,

251
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,959
that made me want
to have sex with them more

252
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,088
because there is nothing hotter
than someone respecting your boundaries.

253
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,133
You're just like, "What?
Take your pants off. Get over here."

254
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,220
The hottest thing
you can say to a girl is,

255
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,056
"Hey, we don't have to do anything."

256
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,268
Now we do.

257
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:43,609
So I still do this
as a sexually active adult.

258
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,487
I pretend I'm not ready to have sex
with someone new yet,

259
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,739
just to make sure
they're a good person first.

260
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:51,033
I call it the gobstopper test.

261
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:54,244
I go, "Ooh, I'm not ready. Is that okay?"

262
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,497
He's like, "Totally fine.
No worries at all." I'm like,

263
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,459
"Charlie, you won! You did it.

264
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,465
I knew you could, my boy!
Now, come inside my chocolate factory.

265
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,050
It's all for you."

266
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,022
I am not a casual dater.

267
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,402
Here's how not casual I am.
I actually got engaged this year.

268
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,613
Uh, nope. Didn't work out. Context clues.

269
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,492
I would have expected better from you,
front row.

270
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,329
It's okay. It's all for the best.

271
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,289
Uh, didn't work out.
Just wasn't the right fit.

272
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:43,544
But man, I learned a lot about myself
in the process of getting engaged.

273
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,171
First off, I didn't know
what a basic bitch I was,

274
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,008
who was gonna love
being engaged that much,

275
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,677
but something happened
when that ring went on my finger.

276
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,638
Something in my stupid
lady lizard brain went...

277
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,140
"bloop!"

278
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,018
"Level completed."

279
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,107
I just kind of floated through Target,
like...

280
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,489
"Oh, am I better than everybody?

281
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,579
What's that? No, I don't need help.
Someone loves me.

282
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,541
I'll find the towels,

283
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,418
right after I cancel therapy.

284
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,464
I'm all fixed."

285
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,508
I wore that ring for two months.
I never got used to it.

286
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,303
It kept getting caught on stuff,
like sweaters and my freedom.

287
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,512
It was cumbersome.

288
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:44,897
It also didn't look right on me. It was
a diamond on this. It looked stupid.

289
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,149
I looked like a rescue dog
in a Gucci sweater.

290
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,443
It was... so dumb.

291
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,654
I had a friend who goes, "Are you afraid
you're going to get mugged?"

292
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,657
I'm like, "Bitch, I look like I stole it.
Are you serious?"

293
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,286
I knew I was too young to get married

294
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,706
because people kept telling me I was.
I had so many people that were like,

295
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,667
"I got married at 25.
Don't know if I'd do that again."

296
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,712
I'm like, "Aren't you guys still
together?" They're like, "Yeah."

297
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:16,223
I had a woman at one of my shows
yell at me from the audience. She goes,

298
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,014
"You should really wait till you're 27
to get married."

299
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,390
I said, "Why 27?" She goes,

300
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,769
"'Cause that's when your frontal lobe
has finished developing

301
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,356
in your brain.
That's when your brain's done, 27."

302
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,903
Yeah, what a mean fact to yell at someone.

303
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,198
Just like, "Oh, you think
you're happy, Scarecrow?

304
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,284
Why don't you wait a beat
till the Wizard gets you a brain?

305
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,038
I've been drinking since noon.
Make me laugh."

306
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,007
But I Googled it, and that fact is real.

307
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,761
And that fact is proof that God is a man

308
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,223
because who else would finish your boobs
years before your brain?

309
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,474
That's bullshit.

310
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,323
You're telling me no one in Heaven's like,

311
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,355
"Hey, God, are you gonna finish
the brain today?

312
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:10,792
You keep putting it off,
and it seems important." He's like,

313
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,859
"This is important!

314
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,324
Don't tell me how to do my job.
I'm God, damn it!

315
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,745
I'm gonna make one of them bigger
for, like, eight years."

316
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,545
I'm sorry if you love God.
That's what he's like.

317
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,029
I did want to be married, though.
I wanted to be married.

318
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,264
Mostly so I wouldn't have to date anymore.

319
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,266
I will say, though, the best time to date

320
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,476
is immediately after
a very painful breakup

321
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,478
'cause your standards are so low.

322
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,398
Oh, after I broke off my engagement,
I was like,

323
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,400
"All I want to do is make out
with someone

324
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,570
who hasn't seen me cry in the tub."
Like, that's all I wanted.

325
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,990
I just wanted a fresh one who didn't know
I was crazy, who'd come in like,

326
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,993
"You're not like other girls."
I'm like, "Mm-mmm, not yet."

327
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,833
You're sitting across from him at dinner
while he talks about his ex. You're like,

328
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,084
"She sounds nuts."

329
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,130
But in your head you're like,
"We would be friends.

330
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,969
If this doesn't work out, I'll call her.

331
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,724
She made a fake Facebook account
to stalk you after you blocked her?

332
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:29,686
That's insane. I would never do that...
on Facebook. She sounds old."

333
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,027
I'm not good at dating.
I tried a dating app once.

334
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,654
I tried OkCupid.

335
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,698
Okay, heard some judgment from the back.

336
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,910
Look, I didn't know.
I didn't know it was a bad one.

337
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,330
I should've known.
The name sounds like giving up. Just like,

338
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,791
"Okay, Cupid, you take a stab."

339
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,798
I just don't like dating apps
because I feel like people

340
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,842
curate these really fake opening lines

341
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,970
that they'll copy and paste
and use on everybody.

342
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,639
I talked to a guy who told me on Tinder,
his opening line,

343
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,099
no matter who it was, was,

344
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:12,062
"So, do you like sunrises or sunsets?"

345
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,111
That's me choking on his dick 'cause
that's a great line. I mean, that's...

346
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,782
That's poetry. It's like...

347
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,411
That's a haiku, I think.
Check my math, but...

348
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,539
That line's a Trader Joe's bag.
You should reuse it.

349
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:37,421
I had a guy on OkCupid send me an emoji
as an opening line.

350
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,756
Not a cute one.
Not like a heart or a kissy face,

351
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,259
or even an eggplant,
which is gross but I get it.

352
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,761
He sent me one of these.

353
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,478
You know the one you never touch 'cause it
looks like Pac-Man getting a colonoscopy?

354
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,211
Half of you won't enjoy this joke 'cause
you don't know what I'm talking about.

355
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,154
That's how rarely this emoji is used.

356
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,492
I responded. I was like, "I gotta
make sure this guy doesn't hurt anybody."

357
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,787
So I wrote back and I said,
"Does this work for you?

358
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,457
Do people respond 'cause they're confused?

359
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,876
Are you negging me?
What's happening here?" He goes,

360
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,420
"Well, the way a woman responds
to the emoji

361
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,339
tells me a lot about her character."

362
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,593
I said,
"All right, Detective Douche Rocket,

363
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,431
what does my response tell you
about my character?" He goes,

364
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,433
"Well, it tells me you're really
transparent,

365
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:35,479
honesty is super important to you,
and you have trouble trusting people."

366
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,571
"That emoji works.

367
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,450
We should get coffee, or married.
I don't know.

368
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,078
Dr. Douche Rocket, I'm sorry."

369
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,040
I'm not good at dating 'cause I'm not fun.

370
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:58,043
I'm not like a fun person.
You can probably tell that by now.

371
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,712
For example, this is my impression
of a fun person.

372
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,549
This is what I think fun looks like.

373
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,719
Your creepy uncle trying to corner you
at Christmas.

374
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,305
"You're so big now. Let's dance."

375
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,645
I look like something outside a car sale,
but it's just very depressed. It's like,

376
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,690
"Yeah, we got Subarus in there.
I don't know. I took a bunch of pills."

377
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,154
I've never been fun.
I've never been the life of the party.

378
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,240
At best, I'm the faint pulse
of a potluck.

379
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,534
Like, that's all
I've been able to achieve.

380
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,996
I don't drink. I don't do drugs.
I did start using weed this last year.

381
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,624
You can tell because... Thank you.

382
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:41,294
You can tell 'cause I say "using"
like it's PowerPoint. Wow, I suck.

383
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,757
I started taking edibles at night
because I was having trouble sleeping.

384
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,843
Some of my friends got too excited.
They're like,

385
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,719
"Now we can get high
and go see <i>Spider-Man."</i>

386
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:52,431
I was like, "Oh, no.
I only do that at night-night."

387
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,104
They were like, "You ruined weed too.
How did you...

388
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,272
do that?"

389
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,401
I had to start taking something at night

390
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,204
because I was having nightmares
as an adult,

391
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,071
which is like when you get braces at 40.

392
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,866
Everybody's like, "You're still
doing that?" Like, "Yeah, I guess."

393
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,911
It's embarrassing. And nightmares
as an adult are so much worse

394
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,788
than nightmares as a kid.
So much worse.

395
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,748
A lot of things are worse as an adult.

396
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,041
I think we know that.

397
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,086
Have you tried to give yourselves
an adult pep talk lately?

398
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,130
Yeah, it is laughable.

399
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,298
It's impossible.

400
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,801
You can pep yourself up when you're a kid
'cause you still believe in stuff,

401
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:33,388
like Santa and magic and the government.
You still think...

402
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,390
there are forces at work for you.

403
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,601
So you can shadow box
in the bathroom mirror.

404
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,244
"You're going to do it
'cause you're great and I believe in you."

405
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:43,064
As an adult,
you're just leaning on that sink, like,

406
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,066
"You're gonna do it

407
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,320
'cause what other goddamn choice
do you have?"

408
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,375
You guys tried to buy greeting cards
for your family as adults?

409
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,044
Can't do that anymore.

410
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,754
Too much has happened.

411
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,423
And Hallmark can't cover it.

412
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,302
When you're a kid,
you run into CVS on Father's Day.

413
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,971
"You're the best dad
in the whole world." I'm done.

414
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:20,101
As an adult, you walk down that aisle,
like, "You've always been there for me."

415
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,185
Nope!

416
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:28,276
"Thank you for accepting me
exactly as I..." Okay, try again.

417
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,906
"I couldn't have asked for a better..."
You know what? Screw this.

418
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,284
Excuse me. Do you guys have any
that just say "You are my dad"?

419
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,914
How about "You screwed my mom"?
You got any of those?

420
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,458
I'll get a blank one.
It's fine. All right.

421
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:47,045
"You are a father. This is a day.
Here is a card." Nailed it.

422
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,428
When you have a nightmare as a kid,

423
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,181
you can run somewhere for comfort.
You can go to your parents,

424
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:01,309
"I had a dream there was a werewolf
and a vampire,

425
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,186
and my hands were snakes."
They're like,

426
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,188
"You're an idiot! Go back to sleep.

427
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,274
None of that's real.
Why did we have you?"

428
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,984
You're like, "Okay, awesome."

429
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:15,073
As an adult, you wake up from nightmares.
"I had a dream there was an earthquake

430
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,326
and I got cancer and you cheated on me."
Everybody's like,

431
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,328
"Oh, yeah, that'll probably happen."

432
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,291
They're not even dreams.
They're just premonitions.

433
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,879
So I started taking these edibles
at night, chocolate-covered blueberries,

434
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,048
'cause if I'mma be a drug addict,
I'mma have a treat.

435
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,591
And...

436
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:39,848
When I started taking them,
I was so nervous about becoming a druggie

437
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,642
that I would cut them in half

438
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,604
and then just nibble on half

439
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,522
until I got sleepy.

440
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:53,778
Do you know how afraid of your own
personality you have to be

441
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,365
to be hunched over one blueberry?

442
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,869
The smallest of the fruits.

443
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,290
With a plastic knife from Taco Bell.

444
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,585
Just like, "Ooh, be careful.

445
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,049
You don't want to be fun
to hang out with."

446
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,183
I've never been drunk
'cause I'm pretty sure I'm an alcoholic.

447
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,811
The only times I've ever wanted to drink
are alone in a La Quinta Inn.

448
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,397
I'm told that's where
you're not supposed to do it.

449
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,108
So I stay away from the stuff.

450
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,695
I have been pulled over for drunk driving
completely sober,

451
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,032
which is a great way to find out
that you're a terrible driver.

452
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:43,453
When cops are stopping you on the highway,
like, "Are you wasted?" You're like,

453
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,206
"No, officer. That... was my best."

454
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,716
That cop didn't believe me either.
He kept hounding me.

455
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,053
"How much have you had to drink?
How much? How much have you had?"

456
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,013
Finally I was like, "You don't understand.

457
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,497
"I'm not drunk. I've never been drunk.
I don't even know how.

458
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,310
I'm a little sad.

459
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,981
Is there a sad driving test?"

460
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,549
I think they should have one.
Like instead of a breathalyzer,

461
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,279
they just have you sigh into a harmonica.

462
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,788
And if it's on pitch, they're like,
"Out of the car, Johnny Cash.

463
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,415
Can't have you on the road."

464
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,754
But I'm at a bit of a crossroads
in my life, you guys,

465
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:37,424
because I'm 25, and I don't want to party,

466
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,218
I don't want to hook up, and I guess
I'm not ready to get married,

467
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,178
so what is left for me to do?

468
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,557
Judge people. Exactly. So...

469
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,059
I was on Facebook this week.

470
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,396
Just making sure my family
is still racist, and...

471
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,275
That's a joke.
I don't have to check. And...

472
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,406
I saw that a girl
I went to high school with

473
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,809
just got back from her honeymoon,

474
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:06,369
and she posted that she's going to be
taking a break from social media.

475
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,079
Have you guys seen people do this?

476
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,415
Yeah, these heroes of the internet.

477
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,959
Their big announcement.

478
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,253
"Hear ye! Hear ye!

479
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,716
I will be taking a break
from social media,

480
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,634
#Brave."

481
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,761
Dude,

482
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:26,014
nobody wanted to see a picture
of your sandwich on Wednesday.

483
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,516
No one's gonna miss it on Friday.
All right?

484
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,686
Also, why are you posting about the fact
you're going to stop posting soon?

485
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,314
That's like toasting you're gonna
quit drinking in the morning.

486
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,608
You're not off to a great start,
sweetheart.

487
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,824
This girl made a whole video
for Instagram, Facebook, all of them.

488
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,994
"Hey, guys. Suppose you probably heard
I just got married.

489
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:53,166
And I'm going to be taking
a little bit of a break from social media,

490
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:56,503
just to focus on my new wifely duties."

491
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:00,964
"Wifely duty"?

492
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:04,010
I'm like, "You can't blow your husband
<i>and</i> share cat videos?"

493
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,141
You have two hands. Multitask. Like...

494
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,310
Get an apron.

495
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,233
I thought it was weird though,
so I played the video backwards.

496
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,736
You play it backwards, she's like, "I've
made a huge mistake. Come pick me up.

497
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,863
He's so boring."

498
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,115
We're like, "Yeah, we know. We met him."

499
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:30,036
He's the type of guy, you get halfway home
from the theme park before you're like,

500
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,329
"Shit! Where's Doug?

501
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:37,043
No, we have to go back.
My wallet's in his fanny pack, so..."

502
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,421
Oh, do not feel bad for Doug.
He's terrible.

503
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,217
Every time he tells a story,
somewhere a child loses a balloon.

504
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,269
I went to their wedding.
I'm so glad I did. I learned a lot.

505
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,772
If you're single, go to as many weddings
as possible so you can walk around,

506
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,066
just like, "Okay, not this."

507
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:06,447
We watched her walk down the aisle
for what felt like 45 minutes to an hour.

508
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,657
Oh, my God.

509
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,952
These 20-something brides are really
milking that walk. She's like...

510
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,594
"I am a princess."

511
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,139
It's like, "You're Bigfoot. Speed it up.
We have lives."

512
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,183
I swear, when I get married, I'm gonna jog
a little bit down the aisle,

513
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,102
like I've been in a crosswalk too long,

514
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,896
just like, "I see the numbers
going down.

515
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,148
I'mma have you out of here
in nine seconds."

516
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,400
So she gets about halfway down.

517
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,819
Everybody's like,
"She's an angel. She's beautiful."

518
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,321
She looked okay. And...

519
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,250
You ever go to a wedding, like,
"Huh. That's your best? Interesting."

520
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,325
So...

521
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:01,210
Don't be scared.
Let it resonate with you. So...

522
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:06,299
So she gets about halfway down,
and I start getting antsy,

523
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,176
so I go,
"I'm going to check out the groom."

524
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,219
Usually, at this point in the ceremony,

525
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,889
the groom's crying a little bit
because she's so beautiful,

526
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,767
he's so lucky, they made a mistake.
Whatever it is.

527
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,646
It's part of the experience,
and I wanted my money's worth.

528
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,105
Those knives weren't cheap.

529
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,733
So I look towards the front,

530
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,319
not expecting, like,
a blubbering mess of a man,

531
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,447
just, like, a light produce aisle mist.

532
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,824
You know? Like a respectful

533
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,327
"let's keep those zucchinis damp"
type of deal.

534
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,749
And he was dry as a bone, you guys.

535
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,169
Nothing going on.
Just another Tuesday for this asshole.

536
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:46,130
It's cheaper to get married on Tuesday,
and...

537
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,092
And I thought to myself,

538
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,886
"Wow. If that happens to me,

539
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,805
I'm going to stop my wedding."

540
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:14,158
"You know what? Cut the music.
Cut... Just cut it real quick.

541
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:17,912
- Babe, come here. We're just gonna...
- Just... I miss him!

542
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,997
Sidebar.

543
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:20,789
So much fun.

544
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,085
You need to get your shit together.

545
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,092
I showed up. I have a spray tan.
I'm wearing flavored underwear for you.

546
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,930
Yeah, pot roast panties, just like
your mom used to make, which is weird.

547
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,892
That's a weird request, but I did it.

548
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:45,064
We're going to go back... Don't look
at them. Look at me. I'm your future.

549
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,859
You focus up, buddy.

550
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,820
Oh, don't start crying now.
It's too late and too early.

551
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,951
You save that up
'cause we're going to go back out there

552
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,370
and we're going to get it right this time,
aren't we?

553
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:02,582
Yeah, we are 'cause if you don't...
'Cause if you don't...

554
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,128
I will make your life a living hell.

555
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:10,339
Do you understand me?
I could bake you cookies every day,

556
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,343
or I can make you miserable forever.
I don't give a shit either way.

557
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,098
I just need a project, motherfucker."

558
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,575
But it is feelings like this

559
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,828
that indicate
I am not ready for marriage.

560
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,669
I do want to get married, but I think
before you get married,

561
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,714
you have to make sure
that you're realistic, okay?

562
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,342
About what love and relationships are
and can be.

563
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,969
Not cynical. Don't go too far. I mean,

564
00:34:57,053 --> 00:35:00,181
I made the mistake of babysitting
after I broke off my engagement,

565
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,226
and that is not the time to be
caring for someone with hope.

566
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,438
I was so nervous.
I'm always nervous to babysit.

567
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,316
I don't want to ruin her life
'cause that's her parents' job.

568
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:14,403
So I just put on a Disney movie,
and I hid in the kitchen,

569
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,198
and I thought, "We'll get through
these four hours together."

570
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,785
Halfway through the Disney movie,
this little girl, she's six years old,

571
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,038
she comes running up to me in the kitchen,
and she goes, "Taylor...

572
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,999
what does being in love feel like?"

573
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:36,259
It's tough. How do you even begin
to explain love to a child that young?

574
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,679
How do you begin to explain romance
and courtship? It's complicated.

575
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:43,141
There's an app. You gotta download it
and swipe. There's a whole...

576
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,728
résumé you have to fill out,
take a picture from up here, Facetune it.

577
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,105
That's another app, okay?

578
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:55,611
But I didn't want to lie to her,
and I wanted to relate it to something

579
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:56,863
she would have understood,

580
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:59,615
something she would have experienced
in her young life.

581
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,034
So I thought about it, and I said,
"Being in love

582
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,412
is sort of like...

583
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,163
Okay.

584
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,709
Do you remember when you got lost
at the grocery store?

585
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,335
That was scary, right?

586
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,256
But then do you remember how you felt
when you finally found your mom?

587
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,134
How safe and happy and relieved you were,

588
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,553
and how you ran up to her

589
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,555
and you grabbed her leg

590
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,726
and then you looked up
and it wasn't your mom?

591
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:37,862
That's kind of what it's like
out here, yeah.

592
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,382
You think you know somebody.
Turns out it's just some stranger

593
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,784
with your mom's knees.
Trust no one. Swipe left."

594
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,043
So that's not good.

595
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,715
But you need to be realistic. I have
girlfriends that are terrible about this.

596
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,259
A friend told me that she thinks
the perfect relationship

597
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,929
is one where you
feel safe, but not bored.

598
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:06,891
I'm like, "Bitch, get an Xbox.
That's not going to happen."

599
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:10,228
You have to think about what you want
and what you need in a relationship

600
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,355
because what you want
is usually a fantasy,

601
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,524
and what you need is what's gonna make you
truly happy. Same friends. Like,

602
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,193
"I want Channing Tatum."

603
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,445
"Well, you need Seth Rogen, so...

604
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,906
make peace with it."

605
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,493
I've been thinking about what I want
and need in a partner

606
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,161
because I travel all the time.

607
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,082
I have a weird job where I work at night.
If I want to have a family,

608
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,376
what I need is a stay-at-home dad.

609
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,922
The problem is,
I don't want someone who, like,

610
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,509
plans to be a stay-at-home dad.

611
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,137
Those guys who are like,
"I'd love to be a stay-at-home dad.

612
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,557
You just sit on the floor, smoke weed,
eat crumbs." That guy sucks.

613
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,062
That guy watches your water break
and asks you for a ride to the hospital.

614
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,856
The only upside to marrying that dude

615
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,694
is he'll never leave the baby
in a hot car because he doesn't have one.

616
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,116
I need a guy with goals
and drive and ambition,

617
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,995
and I need him to give all that up
to support mine.

618
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,419
I need to find a winner and destroy him.

619
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,924
I want to say, "This is my husband.
He used to do this."

620
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:26,429
I can feel some people pulling back.
Like, "Taylor, he's going to resent you."

621
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,512
I know.

622
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,853
I'm kind of into that. I'm super into it.

623
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,105
I've dated dudes that don't
make as much money as me.

624
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,149
Almost exclusively. What up!

625
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,484
And one of them really hated it,

626
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,208
made him feel embarrassed
and emasculated,

627
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:44,947
and it was... so hot.

628
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,200
Oh, my God. I'm like,
"Come here, baby girl. We'll role-play.

629
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,037
You can be the breadwinner tonight.
How does that sound?

630
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:54,498
Yeah, you go right back to making pancakes
in the morning.

631
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,626
Don't get cocky just 'cause Daddy lent you
some pants."

632
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,132
I have a savings account.
That makes me Daddy.

633
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:08,095
Then I dated a guy who was super fine
with the situation. He's like,

634
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,348
"So you make more money than me?
Who cares?

635
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,892
Doesn't matter to me at all."
And I was like, "Well...

636
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,312
Okay."

637
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,440
And I don't need you to be upset always.

638
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,400
I just want that edge
in our relationship.

639
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,987
I need you to choke me in bed,
but kind of mean it a little. I want...

640
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,783
I want that power struggle
to keep it hot.

641
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,660
I want you to make passive aggressive
comments at dinner parties

642
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,663
and make all our friends drive home.
Like, "What was that?

643
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,916
Are they okay?"

644
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,504
Sitting in that circle before dinner,
drinking wine, like,

645
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:44,715
"So how are you, Bill?"
He's like, "You know, pretty good.

646
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,468
Hard to sleep with all these dead dreams
under my pillow.

647
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,223
Am I laughing? I've been practicing.
Anyway...

648
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,791
I'm just going to get another beer.

649
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,352
Honey, do you want anything?

650
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,938
I mean, you've already taken everything
from me.

651
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,858
I'm doing finger guns
because I can't shoot you for real."

652
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm like, "Don't worry about him,
everyone. You know how they are

653
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,533
right before they get their allowance."

654
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:20,626
Don't know why some of you seem offended.
I'm the one who has to die alone.

655
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:29,093
I'd like to have kids, too, which is
a shame because I'm so talented, and...

656
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,304
You understand.

657
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,850
I don't know what happened.
A few years ago, I was like,

658
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,937
"Yeah, I'll get to kids." Now it's like,
every day I wake up and my brain goes,

659
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,357
"You have goals." My body's like,
"I'm empty." All the time.

660
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,986
I saw a baby in a fedora last week,
and I was like,

661
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,030
"I need to make something
and put a hat on it right now."

662
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,994
It came from somewhere inside me
I didn't know existed.

663
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,830
I felt like a young boy
who'd just seen porn for the first time.

664
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,624
Just like, "What's happening to my body?
I have to go home forever."

665
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,673
I do still get annoyed
with other people's kids,

666
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,968
which I think will keep me
empty a little bit longer.

667
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,347
My biggest pet peeve are those babies
that wave at you from strollers.

668
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,767
Have you seen these babies?
They're strangers to you,

669
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,353
but they wave like you owe them money
or something.

670
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,939
Like, "Hi." Don't engage. It's a trap.

671
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,567
The same thing happens every time.

672
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,650
"Hi.

673
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,652
Hi.

674
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,324
Hi." "Hi, sweetie. How are you?"

675
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:34,950
You know why they laugh?

676
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,785
'Cause they just wasted your time.

677
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,749
They know one word. It's not
a conversation. That's a dead end.

678
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,668
That would be like me walking up
to a French person like, <i>"Bonjour."</i>

679
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,713
They get excited, talk to me in French,
and I go...

680
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:52,092
Then a bigger person wheels me away
in a carriage.

681
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,097
<i>"Au revoir,</i> asshole.

682
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:01,393
You thought you made a friend. Baguette."

683
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:14,615
I do want to have kids,
but I want to make sure before I have them

684
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,410
that I have made enough mistakes
so that I give great advice as a parent.

685
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,579
You have to make mistakes,
learn from them,

686
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,343
and then you give amazing advice.
My dad read his Bible every night,

687
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,418
he got a scholarship to college,
married my mom, and then had us.

688
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,588
His advice was terrible. He'd be like,
"Don't do that." We're like, "Why?"

689
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:33,175
He's like, "I don't know, kid. I read it
in a book. I've never really lived."

690
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,305
Joel Osteen pose.

691
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,020
My uncle was a drug-dealing alcoholic

692
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,941
who got shot in the '90s.
I listen to everything that man says.

693
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,528
'Cause he can back it up. He's like,
"Don't do that." "Why?"

694
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,447
"'Cause Uncle Larry pees sitting down now.

695
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,369
Go play."

696
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:10,212
I don't want to be one of these
people that has kids too soon

697
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:12,965
before I think about what it's gonna
be like. My biggest fear

698
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,508
is the technology thing.

699
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,817
My kids are always going to have
the internet. Don't get me wrong.

700
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,722
I'm young.
I had the internet pretty early.

701
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,891
I got the internet as I was going through
puberty, which was awesome.

702
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:26,186
I had a magic box I could hop on
and be like, isthishairnormal.com.

703
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,439
Upload picture.
Someone from Arkansas is like,

704
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:32,026
"You're probably fine." I'm like,
"Cool. I'm getting back on my bike."

705
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,030
I don't know what people did
during puberty before the internet.

706
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,449
Just, like, read Judy Blume
until they started tingling.

707
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,617
Like, what happened?

708
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,663
Can you imagine going through puberty
in the 1300s?

709
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,541
Back then you were alone. Something weird
was happening downstairs.

710
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,461
"That's a little strange.
Hope I'm not a witch.

711
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,299
I can't go swimming."

712
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,471
My daughter will always have the internet,

713
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,265
from the time that she is born
to the time she dies.

714
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,809
She's always gonna have it.
And I have to explain to her

715
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,063
that the internet is the most beautiful,
amazing, disgusting, horrifying thing

716
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:12,399
in the universe. How do you do that
in a balanced, measured way?

717
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,277
"Hey, sweetie. Have fun on the internet,
talk to your friends,

718
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,654
do your homework, but be careful

719
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,822
'cause a lot of people on there
want to kill you."

720
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,826
"Everyone on the internet
wants to kill me?"

721
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:25,329
"Not everybody. Some of 'em
are just nice kids from Arkansas

722
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,248
who want to let you know your pubic hair
is A-OK. But...

723
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:32,336
Yeah, some of them want to wear you
like a skin jacket,

724
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,506
so just please look out for Mommy. Okay?"

725
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:38,842
"But you met Daddy on the internet."
"That's different.

726
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,304
I met your daddy on a dating app.
He sent me a very thoughtful emoji.

727
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,304
And um..."

728
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,435
"Just really saw me for me."

729
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:52,523
"How did you know Daddy wasn't a bad
internet person who wanted to kill you?"

730
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,608
"Look, you little bitch, I didn't. Okay?

731
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:58,445
But Mommy was going through a dry spell,
your daddy had nice shoulders,

732
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,906
so I took a fucking chance."

733

<i>♪ Tale as old as time ♪</i>

734

I have a friend who told me

she either wants to get a dog

00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,389
If you think those are the same thing,
you are not ready for either one.

738
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,308
A dog or a baby? That's like saying,

739
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,561
"Yeah, I'm either going to get
a skateboard

740
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,730
or my pilot's license.

741
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,024
Just whatever I have time for."

742
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:41,488
It is insane to me
how easy it is to have and keep a baby.

743
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,384
Like, if you get your appendix removed,
they won't let you take it home,

744
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,453
but if you have a baby, they're like,
"Here, you dropped this."

745
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,039
And you know there are days
at the hospital,

746
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,458
nurses look at each other like,

747
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,209
"Are we going to let this happen?

748
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:58,464
They both have neck tattoos.
One says 'fuck, ' one says 'babies.'

749
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,507
Either way they stand, it's bad news.

750
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,347
Really, this is fine?
This is fine with you?

751
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,724
What were you gonna name her?

752
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:10,517
'Big Red, ' after your truck?

753
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:12,102
Yeah, we got to do something."

754
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,940
If you want to adopt a kid,
you have to jump through so many hoops,

755
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,233
but if you just have one, pft,

756
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,557
they're like, "That's yours forever."
No questions asked?

757
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,697
That's insane. There's no exit interview
on the way out the hospital

758
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,115
to make sure you're okay?

759
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,659
Just like, "Hey, before we hand you
a baby forever,

760
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,579
can you put this metal bowl
in the microwave for me?"

761
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,718
Some of us not clapping.
I encourage you to go home and try that.

762
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:47,929
Nobody tell him.

763
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,393
I have a friend who has a seven-year-old,
and she shouldn't.

764
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:57,564
And she just bought him an iPhone.
I'm like, "For what?"

765
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,107
She's like, "It's for protection."

766
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,652
I'm like, "Get him a sword.
You're a terrible mother."

767
00:47:03,278 --> 00:47:05,197
I said, "Do you punish
this little prince?"

768
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,951
She goes, "Yes. As a matter of fact,
sometimes I will take away that iPhone

769
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:11,453
for a whole week
and make him use a flip phone."

770
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:16,166
Yeah. A flip phone's a punishment now.
All over the United States,

771
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:19,127
there are little kids going, "No!

772
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,421
All I can play is Snake."

773
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,633
That is not a punishment.

774
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:26,844
You want to hear a real punishment?
When I was a kid,

775
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,513
I wasn't allowed to walk to school
in the morning with my friends

776
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,640
because my dad said I'd get abducted.

777
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,767
But then anytime I forgot to do a chore,

778
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,770
he would make me
walk home from school alone,

779
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,022
as if to say,
"You don't want to do your dishes?

780
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:41,692
We don't care if you disappear
this week."

781
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,779
That's a punishment.

782
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,739
That's why I'm up here.

783
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,418
I was trying to understand
my friend's parenting style

784
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,837
because I don't have kids
'cause I'm responsible.

785
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,154
And I said, "Have you thought
about alternative punishments?"

786
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:09,136
And she goes, "Like what?" "I don't know.
Chores, grounding, spanking."

787
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,659
She's like... I'm like,
"Is he behind me? Did he hear?

788
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,850
Where is he? You got eyes on him?"
She's like, "I can't believe you suggested

789
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:17,853
I spank my child."
I said, "Whoa, nobody suggested that.

790
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:20,147
I don't believe in spanking,
but I did get spanked,

791
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,107
so there's a bitter part of me
that was like,

792
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:25,485
'They'll not have it better than me, '
that I had to work through in therapy.

793
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:29,114
And I've done that work. I wasn't sure
if you had. It was just a question.

794
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,950
Also, why are you acting
like I invented spanking?

795
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,953
I didn't come in here, like,
'You know what would be good?'

796
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,624
We both got spanked.
What are you talking about?"

797
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,917
I got spanked growing up.
Did you guys get spanked?

798
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,920
Yeah. Do you feel fine? I feel fine.

799
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,881
Do you feel fine? I feel fine.
Do you feel fine? I feel fine.

800
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:47,164
Do you feel fine? I feel fine.

801
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,426
If we keep saying it,
will we be fine? Maybe.

802
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,395
You know, every three years, you're like,
"Was I abused? Let's not ruin Christmas."

803
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,735
Have you guys realized your parents
messed you up yet?

804
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:09,696
Have you found that stray dent
in your head? "What happened there?"

805
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,240
They're like, "We did our best.
That's what happened there.

806
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,618
You were slippery, so..."

807
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,633
You had this happen as adults:
you realize your parents messed you up

808
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:24,753
based on how other people react
to stories about your childhood.

809
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,632
Stories you thought were fine
'cause when you're a kid, you're stupid.

810
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,677
You're just like,
"Everybody gets tied in the yard.

811
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,972
Happy Fourth of July."

812
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,558
Fast forward ten years,

813
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,728
you're at a work party, everyone's
going around swapping stories, like,

814
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,397
"Yeah, my mom was crazy.

815
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,066
She used to make us
take our shoes off in the house."

816
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:49,945
And you're like, "Oh, my God. I know!
We wore muzzles at night.

817
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,410
What happened? Why'd everyone get sad?

818
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,956
We could wear them on the carpet.
It wasn't like her thing."

819
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,755
But my friend was very offended,
and I felt terrible,

820
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,674
and I said, "I'm very sorry."
And she said,

821
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,176
"You know what, Taylor?
I'm never going to spank my kid.

822
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,220
Our parents shouldn't have
spanked us either.

823
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,264
Spanking is the same as hitting."

824
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,516
And I was like, "Okay, back up.

825
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,894
There was a huge difference
between what my parents did and hitting.

826
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,439
Location, location, location.

827
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,693
They never spanked me in the face.
There's stuff in my face.

828
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,403
People can see that, all right?

829
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:34,489
There was nothing in my butt
except justice for my parents."

830
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,743
I got spanked so much growing up,

831
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,870
I thought that's what your butt was for.

832
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,331
I thought God made the first kid
and was like,

833
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,544
"I'd better add some fat somewhere
in case this starts mouthing off

834
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,754
at Olive Garden."

835
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:59,389
Parents are so nice to their kids now.
It's crazy.

836
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,267
I mean, parents apologize
to their children.

837
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,603
Did you know apologies
went that direction?

838
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:08,774
Did you know you could drive backwards
on the freeway? It's crazy town out there.

839
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,819
The closest my parents ever got
to apologizing was this...

840
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,988
"You're okay.

841
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,825
You're all right."

842
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,621
"You're okay" was code for,
"Don't call anybody.

843
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,250
Let's just chalk this up
to a whoopsie-daisy.

844
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,296
I think mistakes were made on both sides.

845
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,049
Walk it off. I love you."

846
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:40,388
My friends talk to their children
like they're human beings.

847
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,681
Like they're equals.

848
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,851
They get down here at eye level.
They make eye contact.

849
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,480
I didn't know the color of my father's
eyes till I was 22 years old.

850
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:52,400
And that's just 'cause his license
fell out of his wallet once.

851
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,029
They're down here, like, "Hey, buddy.
How's the Lunchable treating you? Good?

852
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,825
Awesome. Well, if you have any feedback
for me, notes, input of any kind,

853
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,118
I would love to hear it.

854
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:05,372
You know why? 'Cause it's your childhood.
I'm just honored to be a part of it."

855
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,876
Anybody recognize any part
of that speech?

856
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,630
My parents were amazing parents.
I love them very much.

857
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,424
They did a fantastic job,
but they were old-school,

858
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:19,553
tough love, no coddling parents.
All right?

859
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,721
When I was 15, I told my dad,

860
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:24,992
"I'm very depressed. I need a therapist.
I've been thinking about killing myself."

861
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,352
And he took a knife
out of the knife drawer,

862
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,771
shook it over his head and went,

863
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,857
"Be my guest."

864
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,780
And I was like,
"Wow! I don't want you to fix it.

865
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,532
I just want you to listen."

866
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,164
The best part of that story is,
I brought it up to him recently,

867
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,124
and he just goes,
"Oh, yeah. I remember that."

868
00:52:56,673 --> 00:53:00,343
I'm like, "Yeah, me too,
every week in therapy."

869
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:04,389
He's like, "I called your bluff, though,
didn't I?

870
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,310
Look who's not dead, drama queen."

871
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,394
I'm like, "Okay.

872
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,855
Touché, big guy. Only on the inside.

873
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:15,650
Am I laughing? I've been practicing."

874
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,698
There's no healthy fear of your parents
anymore.

875
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:24,367
Nobody's scared of their parents.
I was terrified of my parents.

876
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,494
I never talked back to my mom,
except for once.

877
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,622
She was spanking me
in the church parking lot

878
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:32,042
because you gotta get rid of those demons
before you enter the house of the Lord.

879
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,253
So she's cleansing her soul,
a little pre-communion,

880
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,132
and halfway through, I go,
"That didn't hurt."

881
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,346
And she went black in the eyes,

882
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,475
and in a voice I'd never heard, goes,

883
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,558
"Oh...

884
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,189
Well, then, we're going to have to
make it hurt."

885
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:57,817
And for the rest of my childhood,
wooden spoon.

886
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:01,863
She went Martha Stewart on my ass.
I still cannot watch the Food Network.

887
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,325
<i>Great British Bake Off</i>
doesn't calm me down.

888
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,913
But I never talked back again.
You try to spank a kid now,

889
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,414
they'll laugh in your face.

890
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,792
They'll be bent over
on the iPhone you pay for,

891
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,919
looking up
reasons why you're a dickhead.

892
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:19,756
"Really? You're going to go through
with this, even though <i>Psychology Today</i>

893
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:23,093
says that you're undermining
my well-being long-term?

894
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,597
All right, Eileen, you stupid bitch.
You do what you got to do.

895
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,433
Yeah!

896
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:40,318
I'll be down here playing Angry Birds
and googling how you live with yourself."

897
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,947
By the time I have kids,
they're gonna be monsters.

898
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,450
"How dare you address me directly?
Avert your eyes.

899
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,828
And get out your boob. I'm hungry.

900
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,705
The big one."

901
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:57,168
I'm like, "Who gave you an accent?"

902
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:03,049
I had amazing parents. I keep saying that
in case anyone here knows them.

903
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:05,593
Anyone can come to these.

904
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,097
I love my parents.

905
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,017
I think if you expect your parents
to be perfect, you're immature.

906
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,853
Okay? Parents aren't these magical,
perfect beings.

907
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,314
They're just people who suck,
like the rest of us.

908
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:21,109
That's how we should introduce them.
"These are my people, Rhonda and Tim.

909
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,402
They do what they can."

910
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,449
My dad was very overprotective.

911
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:32,037
He had four daughters, which means he was
just like playing dick goalie and...

912
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,206
You don't have to laugh.
He hates that joke too.

913
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,751
His biggest fear was that one of us

914
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,086
would become sexually active
before we got married,

915
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,840
and, uh, some of us
have been activated, so that's...

916
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:47,177
Can't take this back to Best Buy.
"I've spilled some stuff on it."

917
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,389
On it. In it. The keys don't work.
It's over. So...

918
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,353
I would hate to be the father of four
daughters. It seems very stressful.

919
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,676
My younger sister's in college.

920
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,898
She had lingerie delivered
to my parents' house once

921
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,067
'cause she's an idiot
with an Amazon Prime account.

922
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,863
And my dad opened the box because he's
a middle-aged man who pays the mortgage,

923
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,115
and if a box comes to his house...

924
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,501
that's his box.

925
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,588
He didn't talk to anybody about it.
He just opened the box,

926
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:24,672
freaked out,

927
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,258
and then hid it behind a plant
in his room.

928
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,595
That was his solution. Just like...

929
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,902
"Well, she can't have sex
without her underwear."

930
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,665
I really respect my dad a lot.
You know why? He was never a hypocrite.

931
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,501
He was just as strict with himself
as he always was with us.

932
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,545
We found porn
on my dad's computer once,

933
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:07,132
and it was like the porn of a good man.

934
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,720
Like, I think he Googled "missionary."
Like, I don't even think...

935
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:14,806
he was looking for porn.

936
00:57:14,889 --> 00:57:17,267
I think he was trying to become
a missionary,

937
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,519
and he just got lost.

938
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,813
The internet just duped him. He's like,

939
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:24,232
"That's not my wife. Why is she naked?"

940
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,943
I'm the only person who's ever found porn
on their dad's computer

941
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,570
and <i>gained</i> respect for him.

942
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,907
It wasn't even porn. It was just a pop-up.

943
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,469
I know that sounds naive to say,
but my dad doesn't watch porn.

944
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:38,163
He won't even watch sex scenes
in movies and TV shows.

945
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:39,789
One came on in a theater once,

946
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,958
and he marched out
like it was a protest.

947
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,669
He came back 40 minutes later.

948
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,963
I was like, "Wow,
remind me to high-five Mom.

949
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,781
I'm like, "Where were you?
You missed half the movie." He's like,

950
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:59,184
"Well, we're not at home.

951
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,394
You can't fast-forward."

952
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,484
I was like, "You fast-forward through sex
scenes in your own house?" He's like,

953
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,735
"Damn straight.

954
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:10,695
God is everywhere."

955
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,825
And I said, "Bless your heart.
You deserve to see some boobs

956
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:18,411
that you're not married to
every once in a while."

957
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,497
So I bought him <i>Game of Thrones</i> on DVD.

958
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,587
I said, "You can't fast-forward.
They're talking while they're naked.

959
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,670
It's important."

960
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:35,553
I'm so glad I was raised by my dad.
I mean, I think I'm so much like him.

961
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,990
He's made me the person I am.
He's the reason I do stand-up.

962
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,390
I don't watch porn.

963
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,601
Not 'cause I'm against it.
I just never got into it.

964
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,103
The same way some adults
didn't read Harry Potter.

965
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,980
You missed your letter to Hogwarts.

966
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:50,026
I have a friend... hates it. She's like,
"I hate pornography, Taylor."

967
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,445
She calls it "pornography,"
like a loser.

968
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,155
And I said, "Why is that?"

969
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:58,409
And she goes, "Because it sets unrealistic
expectations for men and women.

970
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,620
It's so unrealistic." I'm like,

971
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:03,998
"Have you seen porn?

972
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,669
It's, like, very realistic. Like...

973
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:09,963
Like, they are fucking.

974
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:13,007
I think you saw <i>Star Wars."</i>

975
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,471
She goes, "No, Taylor. It's unrealistic
'cause those women aren't finishing, okay?

976
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:23,101
They're faking it." And I was like,
"Yeah, it's super realistic.

977
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:26,006
Isn't that what we're all doing?"

978
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,065
Fake it till you make it.
Back to your place to finish yourself off.

979
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,233
Am I right?

980
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:34,028
That's a joke. I've never faked it.
I've never loved someone that much.

981
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,659
I don't hand out trophies for showing up.
Grab an orange slice and a Gatorade.

982
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:42,370
Get back down there.
Let's see some hustle, Anderson.

983
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:47,041
You guys are absolutely amazing.
Thank you so much.
