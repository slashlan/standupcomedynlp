1
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,121
Hello, London!

2
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,045
That's my town.

3
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,006
Uh...

4
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,967
This is my second home.

5
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,680
I lived here for ten years.

6
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,098
I love London.

7
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,226
I actually recorded
a couple of specials here before.

8
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,938
When I lived here, I was broke.
I had no fucking money.

9
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,275
And maybe like 12 years ago,

10
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,776
I signed a contract

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,114
for five comedy specials for £90,000

12
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,325
with a record label over here,
which, when you're broke...

13
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,414
sounds like a really good
fucking deal, right?

14
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,625
I had no money
and someone offered me £90,000,

15
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,670
I was like, "Fuck, yeah,"
for five comedy specials.

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,548
But that is the worst deal
in record history.

17
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,509
Five comedy specials for £90,000.

18
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,596
Anyway, I was locked in.
I recorded one,

19
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,391
and then I got offered
an HBO special in America.

20
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,227
And so I went back to my record label
over here,

21
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,937
and I said, "Hey, here's the deal.

22
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,023
I just got offered a big deal in America.

23
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,899
What I'll do is I'll go over there,

24
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:51,737
I'll do the special then I'll come back
and do the other four specials with you."

25
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,905
And then my record label here went,

26
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,825
"You can't do that.
You're contracted to us,"

27
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,453
and I went, "Oh, that's a shame."

28
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,666
Then I got on a plane
and I went to America.

29
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:10,881
And then HBO said, "You sorted
that contract problem out, didn't ya?"

30
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,883
And I went, "I sure did."

31
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,471
And then I did the HBO special

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,391
and then my record label here
sued me for £200,000,

33
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,562
which is like, $300,000 American, right?

34
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,981
But it doesn't matter,

35
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,526
because HBO paid me $50,000, so...

36
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,697
So, you gotta spend money
to make money, you know?

37
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,742
So I was a little bit in the hole.

38
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,622
I had spent a lot of that earlier money
on drugs already.

39
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,377
So now I'm...

40
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,379
I'm poor and famous.

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,715
See, everybody wants to be
rich and famous.

42
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:56,218
And rich and famous is fucking amazing.

43
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,179
Poor and famous sucks dicks.

44
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:04,226
Have you ever been in a pound store
and been famous? That's...

45
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,772
So anyways, I'm poor and famous, right?

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,982
So I have sex with this American woman...

47
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:14,152
Consensually! I asked her.

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,613
She said yes, she enjoyed herself.

49
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,739
Anyway...

50
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,953
So I had sex with this woman,
and she thought, 'cause I was on the TV,

51
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,079
that I had money.

52
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,749
So she tried to extort me for $50,000.

53
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,170
She goes, "I have a sex tape of yours,
and I'm going to sell it."

54
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,049
And I went, "Fucking try."

55
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,513
"I don't know what the market is
for the podgy, pale Australian guy

56
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,058
who lasts a minute and a half,
but see what you can fuckin' get."

57
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,189
Then she goes, "Well, I have a photo
of you doing cocaine."

58
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,693
And I went, "Everyone does!

59
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:00,782
I've done cocaine off photos
of me doing cocaine."

60
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,036
"And you want to extort me?

61
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,915
Why don't you get a picture of me
being nice to my mother

62
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,668
or opening a door for a woman
or something off-brand?"

63
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,006
Now, I used to do
a lot of misogynistic jokes.

64
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,966
I'm not going to do as many of those.

65
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,050
I'll do some.

66
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:24,723
There's a lot of problems at the moment.

67
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,851
There's a lot of guys
that are raping people,

68
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,980
and a lot of people in the entertainment
business are going down,

69
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,817
some for more offensive things
than others, you know, but...

70
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:38,320
I'm nervous.

71
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,613
You know, I...

72
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,993
I don't think I've done anything wrong,
but between the hours of nine and nine,

73
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,328
I'm pretty blacked out.

74
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,496
Anyway, so...

75
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:55,253
Like, if James Bond was a real person,
he'd be super fucking nervous right now.

76
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,009
James Bond would be showing up to work,
like, "I'm here to see Q."

77
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,969
"Actually, you're here to see HR."

78
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,978
"We have 472 complaints
from a Miss Moneypenny."

79
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,605
Ah!

80
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:18,360
"Two Russian operatives say you used their
power against them and had sex with them."

81
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,655
"I was trying to get information.
You're welcome."

82
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,951
There's been like, Kevin Spacey went down.

83
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,079
Kevin Spacey, he went down, and he goes...

84
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,997
He goes, his defense was,

85
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,292
"It's probably a good time to mention
that I'm gay."

86
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,673
And we were like, "What?

87
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,218
Kevin, say it's not true."

88
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,427
Um...

89
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,098
Yeah, Kevin gets a bit grabby.

90
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,270
From all reports,

91
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,565
he reaches,
he touches your dick outside your jeans.

92
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,150
For a little bit. He's a dick grabber.

93
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,865
We all have that gay friend, don't we?

94
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,411
We all have that gay friend
that every time you're drunk,

95
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,872
you're like, "Get out of of it,
don't touch my dick."

96
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,041
And they're like,
"I'll get you next time,"

97
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,127
I'm like, "I'm sure you will,
but not today."

98
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:23,383
But he paid the price, as people should
when they do things wrong.

99
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,885
He paid the price.

100
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,304
You know, he had a great career,

101
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,514
and Netflix,
the network we're on right now,

102
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,600
they fired him, and rightfully so.

103
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,268
And he lost his job

104
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,811
as a fake president.

105
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,151
Yet there is an actual president...

106
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:45,280
with four times as many allegations...

107
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,824
who still has his fucking job.

108
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,706
We have a guy...

109
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,083
who said, and I quote...

110
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,668
"I love women...

111
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,921
when I see them, I kiss them.

112
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,798
I don't even ask.
I can't help myself.

113
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,385
I grab 'em by the pussy.

114
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,263
When you're famous...

115
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,723
they let you."

116
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,147
Now, I'm famous.

117
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,069
And when I heard that,
I went out and I gave it a go.

118
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,239
And I gotta tell you, they don't let you!

119
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,576
You women are a sensitive bunch.

120
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,994
Moody, if you will.

121
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,120
Now...

122
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,168
The term "Grab 'em by the pussy,"
as soon as that happened,

123
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,463
I started tweeting and saying
in interviews jokes about it.

124
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,177
And people started writing me saying,
"Yes, well, you've said worse things,"

125
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,972
and I have, and this evening,
I will say worse things.

126
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,184
And that's why I agree
that I shouldn't be president

127
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,061
of the United States of America.

128
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,773
I'm not qualified.

129
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,693
Don't use me as your moral benchmark.

130
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:10,031
Do you think I'm offended
by the term "Grab 'em by the pussy"?

131
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,242
I'm not offended by it.

132
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,369
I'm confused as fuck.

133
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:20,083
I've never heard those words grouped
together into a fucking sentence.

134
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,590
If he said, "I grab 'em by the tit,"
I know what a tit-grab entails.

135
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,679
I can picture a tit-grab.
I'm fully aware of what's going on there.

136
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,432
"I grab their ass," I know that.

137
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,934
Even if it was weird,
like "I grab 'em by the head,"

138
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,436
I can picture a head-grab.

139
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,275
"Grab 'em by the pussy," you see...

140
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,445
the pussy is an inward thing.

141
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,783
If I said to you right now, "I met a girl,

142
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,037
I grabbed her by the belly button."
How fucking confused are you?

143
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:01,124
You'd be like, "Did you poke it?"
I'd be like, "Nah...

144
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,418
I didn't poke it.
I grabbed the whole thing.

145
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,254
Keep up!"

146
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,592
Like, if he said, "I palm their pussy,"

147
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,594
I can picture a pussy-palming.

148
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,680
Like if he just scooped his hand over.

149
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,811
Or if he fingered a pussy.
We've all fingered a pussy,

150
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,897
whether it be our own or someone else's.

151
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,776
But to grab a pussy...

152
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,448
that's gotta be one fucking meaty,
low-hanging fruit fucking pussy.

153
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,577
That's gotta be a pussy
that's just given birth,

154
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,079
is prolapsed.

155
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,623
They haven't put the stitches in yet.

156
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,584
Maybe that's what he does.

157
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,338
Maybe he goes around to maternity wards
and goes, "Congratulations!

158
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,300
It's a beautiful child.
Don't worry about it. I'm famous."

159
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,893
This has taken up far too much space
in my brain.

160
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,315
I've been thinking about pussy grabbing
for over a year now.

161
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:12,654
Like, he says they don't mind.
What is the scenario...

162
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,281
where you can grab a pussy...

163
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,283
and no one minds?

164
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,204
I guess it has to be in a private area,

165
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,498
'cause you can't do it
in the general public,

166
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,333
because for the most part

167
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,086
pussy grabbing is "frowned upon."

168
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,758
If I jumped into the crowd right now
and grabbed a pussy...

169
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,886
you'd all be like, "Stop that, Jim."

170
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,183
"Get back on stage. Finish the show."

171
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,523
So I've thought of every scenario,
I've thought of every available option

172
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,942
on how to grab a pussy
where everything's fine.

173
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,069
This is the only one
I can think of, right?

174
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,115
Okay, the woman has to feel
comfortable and safe.

175
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,743
So I picture a woman who's like,
she's in her own garden.

176
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,123
She's feeling good. It's her garden.

177
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:08,418
She feels safe, it's a secluded garden.
There's fucking hedges and shit.

178
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,589
She's wearing a mini-skirt, no underwear.

179
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,300
She doesn't give a fuck. It's her garden.

180
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,970
And she's gardening.

181
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,972
She's tending to soil.

182
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,684
She's potting a plant.

183
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,688
And then you, the celebrity...

184
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:35,486
You have to creep into the garden,
almost cartoonishly, just...

185
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,496
Then you get your hand like that,
so devil horns open up, flip around.

186
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,794
Now you want to be
a real good pussy grabber,

187
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,214
'cause you're only going to get
one shot at this.

188
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,425
and that thumb's going
straight into the asshole.

189
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,762
So you're like, "Bang!"

190
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,973
Right, to begin with, she's shocked.
"What the fuck's going on?"

191
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:08,978
While she's in that state of shock,
lift her up, she's on her toes.

192
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,189
She's not going anywhere.

193
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,691
She's upset, but then she turns around,

194
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:16,486
"Oh, you're famous,"
and everything's fine.

195
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,705
Now, I don't want to spend
too much time talking about

196
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:30,124
American politics while I'm here.

197
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,752
You've got your own issues.

198
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,713
All right, look...

199
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,259
I know you broke away
from the European Union.

200
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,344
I don't understand what happened.

201
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,263
I know it's mixed, the opinion.

202
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,059
I don't know what's going on,
but then when I talk to you people,

203
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,228
you don't fucking know
what's going on, either.

204
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,940
I'm never seen something
happening in a country,

205
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,567
where you're all like,
"No idea what's happening."

206
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,946
There's so many things.

207
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:03,408
Like, do you get rid of
the European people who are living here?

208
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:09,372
Or, like... in your hospitals,
you have 250,000 nurses

209
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:13,376
who are from like Spain and France
and all that type of bullshit, right?

210
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,169
Do you get rid of those people?

211
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,882
And if you do do that,
do you get back all the British people...

212
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,802
who live in Spain and France and all that?

213
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,597
'Cause I gotta be honest,
they're not your best people.

214
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,144
Right? Like...

215
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,982
you should have a TV show every night
called <i>One In, One Out.</i>

216
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,821
And it's like, "And who are we
getting rid of today?

217
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,782
Okay, well, first of all,
we're getting rid of Rosita.

218
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:48,369
Rosita is a nurse
who took care of the elderly,

219
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,121
who incidentally voted her out.

220
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,292
And..."

221
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,925
"And who are we getting back?
We're getting...

222
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,927
Barry!"

223
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:11,351
"Barry's a cab driver who won ten grand
on a scratchy and moved to Majorca."

224
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,067
Feels like a fair swap you got there.

225
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,950
See, immigrants are good.
You wanna have them, man.

226
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,996
Unless they're fucking Mexicans.

227
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:38,086
I live in LA, you wouldn't believe
the problems we have with Mexicans.

228
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,463
Fucking dirty Mexicans.

229
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,133
They come over the border,
and they're taking all the good jobs.

230
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,095
They can't even speak English,
they're taking all the good jobs.

231
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,181
I don't know how they do it, but they do.

232
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,018
Sometimes I look at my son, and I think...

233
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:57,271
"If only he could pick fruit someday."

234
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,863
I have this woman who cleans my house
twice a week.

235
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:10,159
You wouldn't believe the amount
of white people who applied for that job.

236
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,244
Oh!

237
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,038
They were queued around the fucking block,

238
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,624
and I was like, "Get the fuck away
from my house.

239
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,420
I don't like explaining everything twice."

240
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,013
This is what Trump reckons.
Trump reckons that the Mexicans...

241
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,266
are coming over the border...

242
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,184
and they're raping.

243
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,980
I don't know how, though.

244
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,691
It just doesn't feel like
the opportune time.

245
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:50,867
You're trying to flee a country,
you're dehydrated, you're in the desert.

246
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,664
That would be the last thing on my mind,

247
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,959
but that's because I'm not
as sneaky as a Mexican.

248
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,343
"They're coming over the border
and they're raping."

249
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,971
Sure, maybe some of them.

250
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,015
You know, maybe.

251
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,601
But some of every nationality rapes.

252
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,479
It's not like it's a Mexican thing.

253
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,900
It's not like if you go to
a really authentic Mexican restaurant...

254
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,864
And there's like a fucking sombrero
and a piñata,

255
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,116
and you walk in with your wife and kids,

256
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,535
like, "This is very nice.
This is a lovely restaurant."

257
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,121
Then, a waiter takes you away
from your family...

258
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,086
Off to the special Mexican closet.

259
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,758
You come back out,
your ass is like a Japanese flag.

260
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,475
You look at your wife, and you're like,
"Why do we keep coming here?

261
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,144
Every week.

262
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,231
If the food wasn't so good..."

263
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,485
It's not a Mexican thing.

264
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,654
Sure, some of them are rapey.

265
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,490
Every nationality rapes.
You have British rapists,

266
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,116
you have Australian rapists,

267
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,744
or Australia wouldn't exist
in its current state.

268
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,662
There's...

269
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,084
There's probably a Canadian rapist,
one fella.

270
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,256
Polite bloke.
You know, a nice bloke.

271
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,343
Where you're going for a jog,
and he just drags you into some bushes,

272
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,721
like,
"I'm so sorry about this. I'm so sorry."

273
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,935
I won't be too long.
I don't want to ruin your day."

274
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,193
That's why I do believe
there should be a wall.

275
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,820
There should be a wall...

276
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,905
on the Canadian border.

277
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,661
So that when the Americans
run out of health care,

278
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,955
they can't crawl over into Canada.

279
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,750
I think the Canadians
should just make the wall three foot high.

280
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,839
Just to take the piss.

281
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,427
So that when the Americans
are crawling over,

282
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:18,014
because their lungs are filled with coal
from getting all their jobs back.

283
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,813
Like, who the fuck...

284
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,817
wants their job back in the coal mine?

285
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:31,902
Like, what the fuck is...

286
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,780
They're like, "We're gonna get
our coal mining jobs back."

287
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,075
What the fuck?
I didn't even know coal was still a thing.

288
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,454
As soon as Trump said it,

289
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,581
I'm like,
"Is this is a fucking Dickens novel?

290
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,749
What the fuck?"

291
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,502
And why the fuck do these people
deserve to have a job?

292
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,087
What, because their dad had a job,

293
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,173
and their grandfather had
the same fucking job,

294
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,091
and their great-great grandpappy...

295
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,679
Have some fucking dreams,
you low aspirational fuck.

296
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,558
And they say things,
they're just like this,

297
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,312
like, "If the coal mine shuts down,
then the whole town will shut down."

298
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,397
Yeah, fuck your town. Fuck it.

299
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,026
Fuck it.

300
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,361
In my lifetime,

301
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:16,614
the population of the world has gone
from three billion to seven billion,

302
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,492
and no one wants to move
to your fucking town. Take a fucking hint.

303
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,878
No, it's good. No hecklers, happy.

304
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,338
I don't like the hecklers.

305
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,424
I was doing the Edinburgh Festival
in Scotland.

306
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,885
I have to say Scotland,
'cause American people are watching.

307
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,095
Um...

308
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,098
I was doing the Edinburgh Festival
in Scotland,

309
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:45,559
and I was performing
in front of about 400 people.

310
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,145
I was doing a routine
I've done in one of my older specials

311
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,814
that I don't do any more,

312
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,525
about how you have to
baptize your children,

313
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,819
because if you don't
baptize your children,

314
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,822
and they die in infancy,
then they don't get into Heaven.

315
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,574
Because God's a good guy...

316
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,287
but he does have some rules.

317
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,209
And if he lets one dead baby
into Heaven,

318
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,212
then he has to let
all the dead babies into Heaven.

319
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:14,839
And before you know it,

320
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,758
Heaven's just filled
with fucking dead babies.

321
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,017
So I'm on stage
kicking dead babies around,

322
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,227
as you do at work.

323
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:34,358
And this woman in the fourth row,
very attractive, but she's in hysterics.

324
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,903
She's crying, her eyes are bawling,

325
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,947
and she just stands up and goes...

326
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,991
"You fucking bastard!

327
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,869
You bastard!"

328
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,913
And then she just leaves the room
just in hysterics.

329
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,294
I'm still fucking mid-kick, like...

330
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,635
And then her husband stands up...

331
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,472
and he picks up her handbag,

332
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,600
and he holds the handbag
like all men hold handbags.

333
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,603
Two hands in front of the chest.

334
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,357
"I'm holding this for someone else, so..."

335
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,111
Anyways, he picks up the handbag,
he holds it,

336
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,071
we can still hear her screaming.

337
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,949
She went out the door, she's screaming.

338
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,785
The staff are trying to calm her down.

339
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,870
She's screaming,

340
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,206
and the husband stands up, and he goes...

341
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,041
"I'm sorry, Jim.

342
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,375
I'm sorry, everyone.

343
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:38,005
We were expecting our first child

344
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,634
and she miscarriaged at seven months.

345
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,428
That was six weeks ago

346
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,472
and the baby was due this week.

347
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,142
So we decided to leave the house
for the first time

348
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,311
and forget about our problems..."

349
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,732
"And to try to have a laugh."

350
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:08,702
"Anyway, Jim, the first half of the show
was really great."

351
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,582
And then he just leaves awkwardly,

352
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,544
like, "Excuse me. Sorry."

353
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,462
We can still hear her screaming.

354
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:23,717
Men and women in the room
are crying their eyes out,

355
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,053
which isn't good for comedy, and...

356
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,557
and I'm trying to bullshit
my way out of it.

357
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,101
I'm on stage going, "Hey...

358
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,814
that joke was more about
the hypocrisy of religion

359
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,276
rather than dead babies, per se."

360
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,277
Uh...

361
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,867
And as I'm doing that, in the second row

362
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,495
a Geordie fellow from Newcastle, England,
he stands up in the second row,

363
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,582
and he points at me,
really angry like this, and he goes...

364
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,584
"To be fair...

365
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,044
she's fucking hot."

366
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,265
And this sentence fell out
of my mouth so fast,

367
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,225
I couldn't put the words back in.

368
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,645
I went, "Ah, well,
they get to keep their figure

369
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,856
when they don't carry them full-term."

370
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm not proud of this.

371
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,654
I'm just reporting it.

372
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,700
As soon as I said it,

373
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,078
bottles just started getting thrown at me.

374
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,539
Just fucking... Whoof!

375
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,126
I'm like, fucking from <i>The Matrix,</i> like...

376
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,670
And I was just like, "Good night!"

377
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,677
That was many years ago.

378
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:52,264
If you're watching this special at home,
I hope you had a kid since then.

379
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,515
Um...

380
00:23:58,646 --> 00:23:59,813
What am I gonna do?

381
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,400
Her miscarriage brought so much joy
to other people.

382
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,526
Uh...

383
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,290
I dislike deaf people.

384
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:27,383
Actually, I need to rephrase that.
I don't dislike deaf people.

385
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,969
I hate sign language people.

386
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:33,639
Sign language people fuck me up the wall.

387
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,766
I don't mind the deaf.

388
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,770
Individually,
deaf people can be a delight.

389
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,775
It's when deaf people get into packs,

390
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,360
I don't like them.

391
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,029
If you get a group of deaf people...

392
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:51,115
If you get eight or more deaf...

393
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,157
like a herd of...

394
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,742
A...

395
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,869
A gaggle or a...

396
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,289
What can we all agree on? A murder?

397
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,837
If you get a murder of deaf,
if you get eight or more deaf,

398
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,338
and I have no problem with them.

399
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,340
I just want to say that right again.

400
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:12,136
If you get eight or more deaf,
and you're in a theater in America,

401
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:17,099
they will be seated like this...
They'll be seated four and four, right?

402
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,977
'Cause what happens is,
if you get a murder of deaf,

403
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:25,274
the American government will pay
for a sign language person.

404
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,860
Probably not for much longer,
but at the moment it's a thing.

405
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:28,819
Uh...

406
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,491
The American government will pay for
a sign language person to stand here.

407
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:38,328
Now, the sign language person is normally
a frumpy chick who learned sign language

408
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,914
so she could date a deaf guy
out of her league, but whatever.

409
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:41,874
Anyway...

410
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,252
So...

411
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,674
But no one ever tells me.

412
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,261
They never say,
"Jim, there's a sign language person."

413
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,096
They never fucking tell me.

414
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,349
So I come out,
"Please welcome Jim Jefferies,"

415
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,560
I walk out,
I see the sign language person,

416
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,228
I'm like, "Ah, fuck me."

417
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:05,647
'Cause I've never had a good show

418
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,566
if a sign language person
is standing there.

419
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:08,901
Never fucking happened.

420
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,487
Because the deaf people
are having a horrible time.

421
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,615
They've watched me on Netflix,
they've read my lips,

422
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,618
and they've had the subtitles,
and they've seen the facial expressions.

423
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,244
Now they're not even looking at me.

424
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,791
They're looking at her,
and her comedy timing fucking sucks dicks.

425
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,670
And they can't modulate their sound,

426
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,964
so they're just like,
"This is a shit show,"

427
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:32,382
and I'm like, "No!

428
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,676
It's not a shit show!

429
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,137
And she's like, "Not a shit show."
Like that.

430
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,185
Now I know what you're thinking.

431
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,439
"What's the big deal?
That's eight people out of thousands.

432
00:26:47,523 --> 00:26:48,774
Who gives a fuck?"

433
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,109
I'll tell you why.

434
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:55,447
You can't have a good comedy show
with a sign language person,

435
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,492
because the human brain
isn't fully developed.

436
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,077
If I swear,

437
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,497
and there's a sign language person
standing there,

438
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,417
every single fucking one of you will go,
"And what would that word be?"

439
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:15,551
I do it myself while I'm onstage.

440
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,556
So I'll teach you the word you wanna know.

441
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:23,559
"Cunt," obviously.
You wanna know "cunt."

442
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,648
All right, so that's "vagina."

443
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,152
This is "cunt."

444
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,993
Gotta give it a bit of attitude,
it needs to be a snap.

445
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,709
You ever see deaf person
look at you like, "You cunt!" Like that.

446
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,715
That's a deafie who don't like you.

447
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,721
Then there's fun ones,
like "bullshit," right?

448
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,097
So you do, like, a bull's head...

449
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,892
Cross it around, bullshit.

450
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,227
It's adorable. Bullshit.

451
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,897
I always feel sorry for deaf people

452
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,274
who are in relationships
with other deaf people.

453
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,235
Because occasionally,
you must be fighting.

454
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,447
You're coming home from a party.

455
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,450
You're trying to be a safe driver.

456
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:25,078
And your wife's being a fucking bitch...

457
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:40,719
Bullshit.

458
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,600
And then...

459
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,518
Then there's things that are just like...

460
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:50,395
There's different dialects
for sign language.

461
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,397
'Cause I've done this whole thing, right?

462
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,982
So in Britain...

463
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,943
this is "Jew."

464
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,991
Seems bad, right?

465
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,910
Wait till you see America.

466
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,122
This is "Jew" in America...

467
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,128
I don't know why,

468
00:29:15,212 --> 00:29:17,631
but that is more offensive than that.

469
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,926
So if you ever see a deaf person,

470
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,594
like, "You Jew cunt!"

471
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,762
Like that.

472
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,268
That's a Trump-voting deaf
you got yourself there.

473
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,398
Then there's things where you feel like
the deaf aren't educated.

474
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,567
Like, this is "gay men."

475
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,328
That's what the deaf think
the gays get up to.

476
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,794
They think they get in a room
and bash dicks together.

477
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:02,843
Now, I was... doing that routine

478
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,887
in New Zealand or something,
I was doing that,

479
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,807
and a guy yelled out,
"Oh, that's docking."

480
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:14,104
I said, "What's docking?"
And then he didn't say anything.

481
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,774
And then I went home
and I googled "docking."

482
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,986
And wasn't that a waste of four hours.

483
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,828
Just a show of hands.
Who knows what docking is?

484
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:33,290
Wow, it's a lot.

485
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,210
For the rest of you,
you're in for a treat.

486
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:42,299
You need two men...

487
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:47,137
And both of them have to have
erect dicks at the same time.

488
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,723
It's already weird, isn't it?

489
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,603
Anyway, one dick...

490
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,355
ideally, to dock...

491
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:06,281
One dick needs to be,
like, a circumcised dick.

492
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:10,369
And the other dick needs to be
a European fella.

493
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,166
Let's talk about this very quickly.

494
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,211
Okay, so...

495
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,963
I'm circumcised.

496
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,965
I know you are all not circumcised.

497
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,509
I know you're not, right?

498
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,846
I got my son circumcised. Right?

499
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,264
When I got my son circumcised,

500
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:34,518
I mentioned on a late night show
that I got my son circumcised,

501
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,605
and I got a lot of hate mail
and people freaking the fuck out

502
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,109
and saying I mutilated my kid
and all this type of stuff, and...

503
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:46,154
Look, people do it for different reasons.
It's a personal thing. Right?

504
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,991
Some people circumcise their children
for religious purposes.

505
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:53,537
Some people do it for medical reasons.

506
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:59,000
The reason I got my son circumcised
is so that when he is older,

507
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,003
women will enjoy having
his dick in their mouths.

508
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,053
I did it because I love him.

509
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,975
And your dicks are fucking disgusting.

510
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,352
You fucking animals.

511
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:21,898
How do you fucking look at your dick
and have any level of self-respect?

512
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:24,901
Every fucking day,

513
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,572
your fucking hooded, slimy fucking dicks.

514
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,868
My dick smells constantly.

515
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,996
It's an eternal battle against that smell.

516
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,458
I can't even imagine
what you accept in your life.

517
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,837
Do you know that it's not in porn?

518
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:47,424
It's not in fucking porn.
Uncircumcised isn't in porn.

519
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,135
Because the people that make porn
are trying to run a business,

520
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:53,638
and they don't want people fucking
vomiting when they're masturbating.

521
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,517
You can't go into a porn site
and put "uncircumcised."

522
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:58,602
It doesn't come up.

523
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:03,982
Your dick is less of a fetish than feet,
you fucking disgusting animals.

524
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,488
Name me one time

525
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,241
where extra skin on the body
is a good thing.

526
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,871
When someone gets old,
they get that turkey neck

527
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,582
and they're like,
"Ooh, I've been looking forward to this."

528
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:25,754
Some fucking 500-pound cunt
loses 300 pounds,

529
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,006
has a big elephant ear of skin,

530
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:31,301
and the doctor goes, "Oh, lucky you!

531
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,887
Extra skin.

532
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:37,265
Women love extra skin."

533
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,730
Anyway, so docking,
you need two dicks, right?

534
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,610
A lovely, pristine dick, and...

535
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:50,695
a horrible dick.

536
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,199
Then you line the two dicks up...

537
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,285
and with your slimy hood...

538
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:03,250
you get that bit,
and you stretch it over the nice dick.

539
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,876
Now...

540
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,545
that'll make a seal.

541
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,922
Now, the only way to break that seal

542
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,841
is to pop a bit of air out of the side
and gently release,

543
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,426
like it's a Tupperware lid.

544
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,305
'Cause you can't just pull against it,

545
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:19,641
'cause then it's like
a Chinese finger trap.

546
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,689
Now that the dicks are docked...

547
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,402
you just gently bash dicks.

548
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:36,866
There's probably kissing, isn't there?

549
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,869
I imagine you'd kiss.
Your mouths are aligned, probably...

550
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,086
And then if you're into each other,

551
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,298
you'll come simultaneously
on each other's dick heads.

552
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,469
That'll make a cum bubble of sorts...

553
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,391
that eventually will just go, "Blugh."

554
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,479
And that's docking.

555
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:15,238
Now, it's weird, because...

556
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:21,036
People... I sort of got more popular,

557
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,998
because of a routine that I did
on gun control, and...

558
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,047
People come and see me
because of the gun control routine,

559
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,633
and they want me to do
some political commentary

560
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,885
or some social commentary,

561
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,846
and then I just did, like, what was that,
ten minutes on docking.

562
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,934
And the thing about
the gun thing is weird.

563
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,270
It's nice to have that as a calling card,

564
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,731
that people want to see you
because they liked that routine,

565
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,359
but then also,
it's a double-edged sword because...

566
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:56,196
I get more popular after a massacre,
and that's really not what you want.

567
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,283
It's not like you're sitting at home,
"Ooh, there's been a massacre."

568
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,077
Uh...

569
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:08,500
It's tough, because people think
if you talk about gun control in America,

570
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,168
you're talking about banning guns.

571
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,753
I'm not talking about banning guns.

572
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,339
I'm talking about controlling guns.

573
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,467
See, after what happened in Las Vegas...

574
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:20,387
That guy shot all those people.

575
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:23,807
I think he had 48 guns
or something like that.

576
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,644
All the news people were like,
"Gun control wouldn't have done anything,

577
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,604
because he bought all the guns legally."

578
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,398
And you're like, "Yeah...

579
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,401
gun control could have
fucking solved that.

580
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,989
How about if we brought in a law
where you're allowed seven?"

581
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,495
"If you can't protect
your family with seven,

582
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,497
you're no fucking good with the guns."

583
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,169
So this whole idea
that if you bring in gun control,

584
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,463
you're going to ban guns,
is a load of bullshit,

585
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,257
because there already is gun control.

586
00:36:57,841 --> 00:37:02,554
There's things like you can't put
a bayonet on the end of your gun.

587
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,098
'Cause that would make
your gun too stabby.

588
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,104
And it's the right to bear arms,
it's not the right to bear guns.

589
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,981
It's the right to bear arms.

590
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,607
Arms are weapons.

591
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:16,067
See, in Texas,

592
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:20,697
you can open carry an assault rifle
on your back into Target.

593
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,325
You can't walk into Target

594
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,161
with a chainsaw.

595
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,831
People would think that's fucking weird.

596
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,500
You walk into Target...

597
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,839
Security would be like,
"What the fuck with the chainsaw, man?"

598
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,967
You'll be like,
"This is my protection chainsaw!

599
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,681
This is to protect me and my family!

600
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:49,392
You'll be happy I'm here

601
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,603
if a bad guy with a chainsaw comes in.

602
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,898
'Cause the only way to stop
a bad guy with a chainsaw

603
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,025
is a good guy with a chainsaw."

604
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:00,820
See...

605
00:38:03,198 --> 00:38:08,036
this idea that all guns are for protection
is fucking bullshit.

606
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,621
They're not all for protection.

607
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,374
You can buy sniper rifles.

608
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,881
Rifles that can shoot two kilometers.

609
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,759
How is that for protection?

610
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,886
Who the fuck...

611
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,097
is sitting in the front of their house...

612
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,479
looking at some cunt
two kilometers away...

613
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,982
like, "Back down!"

614
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,741
But you know, I understand.
People love their families.

615
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,243
They wanna fucking...

616
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,163
I'm actually gonna say something now
that'll make some people upset.

617
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:53,790
It's weird that I say it.

618
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:58,044
I'm a single dad now.
I've been a single dad for over a year.

619
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,797
When people hear it,
they go, "Oh, that's a shame."

620
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,050
Not a shame.
Me and my ex weren't getting along.

621
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:08,012
We're still good friends now.
I'll tell you how we broke up.

622
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,973
This is literally how me
and my ex broke up.

623
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:14,561
I bought a house five doors down
from my house,

624
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,396
and she goes, "What did you get that for?"

625
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,189
And I went, "For you to live in."

626
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,448
And she high-fived me
and skipped down there.

627
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,075
She was happy to go as well.

628
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,619
So now I'm a single dad,

629
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,289
and the weird thing is about being
a single dad is, before that,

630
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:38,084
I used to go on and on and on
about what a great parent I was.

631
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:41,629
But I wasn't a great parent.
I wasn't.

632
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:45,675
I was just a guy
who lived with a four-year-old.

633
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,178
This is how I used to parent.

634
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:50,847
I used to walk around the house,

635
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,266
I saw my son playing with a toy,
I would be like,

636
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,767
"What are you playing with there?

637
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,061
Lego!

638
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,480
Sounds fun. All right."

639
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,485
And then his mum would take him to bed,

640
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,822
and I'd go,
"Good night, sweet dreams, my prince!"

641
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,199
I was a shit parent.

642
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,785
Well, now it's just me and him.

643
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,832
And so I have this four-year-old
that comes once a... every...

644
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,126
Every second week, I get my kid.

645
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,796
He comes over, I try to make it
as normal a family life as we can,

646
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,591
but the little cunt
only eats four different foods.

647
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:32,388
He eats macaroni and cheese,
chicken and fucking pizza and apples.

648
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,143
I try to make him eat other things,
but his mother doesn't.

649
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,771
It's a big argument, that's why
she lives in another fucking house.

650
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,730
Anyway...

651
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,278
But he comes over and I try to have
family meals with him, right?

652
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,696
So it's just me and him

653
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,990
so I make him chicken,
I have to bread it,

654
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,035
I have to do things,
I have to make it a certain level,

655
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,829
and then I cut up some apples,
and then I sit there,

656
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:58,581
and then he comes
and eats dinner with me.

657
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,375
And I'm not gonna make
two fucking meals,

658
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,086
so I'm eating fucking chicken
and apples as well.

659
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,384
So we're sitting there eating a meal,

660
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,719
and I don't let him watch TV
while we're eating.

661
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,763
That's family time, so it's me and him.

662
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,516
But I got to be honest,
I want to watch the TV.

663
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,437
The conversation runs out
pretty fucking quick.

664
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,940
He hasn't got a lot going on.

665
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,776
I go to him, "How was your day?"

666
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,445
And he goes, "I don't know,"
and I go, "What did you do at school?"

667
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,240
He goes, "Drew a picture,"
and I'm like, "Fuck, this is a long meal."

668
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,414
Anyway, so I make him the chicken,
I make him the apples,

669
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:42,625
and then I take him upstairs
for bedtime at 8:30,

670
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,921
and he has a bath and I wash his hair
and I put him in some pajamas,

671
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,464
and he's all fresh and clean.

672
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,592
I put him in the bed,
I sing him the same song every day.

673
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,887
And then I read him a story
and I wait till he falls asleep

674
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,557
and then I go downstairs and watch TV.

675
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,768
And then about two hours later,
about 10:30,

676
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,061
I just hear screaming, just...

677
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:08,234
I run up the fucking stairs,
I get up there, he's covered in vomit.

678
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,529
He's vomited all over.
He's got vomit through his fucking hair.

679
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,740
I pick him up, he's shitting.

680
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,743
Right, he's shitting and vomiting onto me.

681
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:18,077
So he's vomiting onto me,

682
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,996
but he's shitting
in front of where I'm walking.

683
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,664
So I'm walking through shit

684
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,875
as vomit's coming onto me.

685
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:27,879
I put him on the toilet.
I get him a bucket.

686
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:31,215
He is now shitting
and vomiting simultaneously.

687
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,216
Now,

688
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,011
maybe I didn't cook
that chicken long enough.

689
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:39,348
Anyway...

690
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:45,605
So he's just sitting there.
He's never had food poisoning before.

691
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,814
I had the same meal.

692
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,901
The little cunt's just got
a weak constitution. Anyway, so...

693
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:55,531
He's sitting there shitting and vomiting
at the same time.

694
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,284
The poor little fella, 'cause he's four,

695
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,829
his brain doesn't compute
that this won't go on forever.

696
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:05,208
He actually looked at me,
shitting and vomiting,

697
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,877
he looks at me and goes,
"I guess this is me now."

698
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,343
I'm just laughing like,
"You'll be all right, fella.

699
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,844
You'll be all right."

700
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,767
Anyway, this goes on for a couple hours,

701
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,435
where it's about midnight now.

702
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,814
He's empty.
Everything's out of his body.

703
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:30,483
I give him another bath,
and I wash him off,

704
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,902
and I wash all the vomit
out of his hair,

705
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,779
and I put him in some new pajamas,

706
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:39,158
and I say, "Come sleep in my bed, mate.
Everything's going to be all right."

707
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,870
And he sleeps in my bed,
and I pat his back until he goes to sleep.

708
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,831
And then I go to sleep.

709
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:46,707
And then two hours later,

710
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,084
I shit the bed.

711
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:52,421
Now...

712
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,091
this wasn't like...

713
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:59,011
like I woke up with cramps and went...

714
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,346
And then I shit the bed.

715
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,349
No, the shit and the waking up
was a simultaneous thing.

716
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,893
I was lying there, and went...

717
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,023
He's fast asleep,

718
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,568
and I just shit the bed
next to a four-year-old.

719
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,863
Which I assume is a crime.

720
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:20,700
I've never felt so sick, and I get out,

721
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,120
and I'm in my underwear,
there's just shit pouring down my thighs,

722
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,163
and I'm like...

723
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:30,001
And I vomit on the floor,
and I'm walking through my own vomit,

724
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,003
and I'm shitting onto the vomit,

725
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,297
and I make it all the way to my toilet...

726
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,008
and I sit there and I'm shitting...

727
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,259
I didn't have a bucket,

728
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:42,054
so I'm just vomiting
into the fucking bathtub,

729
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,222
and shitting,

730
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:44,849
and I actually said out loud,

731
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,018
"I guess this is me now!"

732
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:57,778
Now, I'm there for a couple of hours.

733
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:02,450
I've taken all my clothes off,
so now it's, like, five in the morning...

734
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,995
and I'm fucking naked,
just still shitting and vomiting.

735
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,956
And my son wakes up.

736
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,418
He's feeling fresh as a daisy.

737
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:18,549
He comes in, his pajamas all clean,
his hair's all fluffy, he walks in.

738
00:45:18,633 --> 00:45:19,467
Holding his teddy,

739
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,886
he walks around the pile
of shit and vomit.

740
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,768
He walks in to see his father
shitting and vomiting on the toilet.

741
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,896
He looks at me and goes,
"We had a tough night, didn't we, Dad?"

742
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,447
Now...

743
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,535
I'm gonna tell you a story.

744
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,622
Now, this story happened...

745
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,665
uh...

746
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,042
about a year and a half ago.

747
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:55,461
I got booked to do a private party

748
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,713
with a very famous...

749
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,591
American singer.

750
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:05,596
And I signed a contract to say
that I would never say who booked me,

751
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,599
how much I was paid,
or who was at the party.

752
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:13,437
But then I've just been telling people,
and nothing's happened, so...

753
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,944
So it's... Mariah Carey. Now...

754
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,448
I get a phone call
from her management one day,

755
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:27,660
and they say,
"Mariah Carey's a massive fan of yours."

756
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,870
And I said, "No, she's not."

757
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:31,872
They go, "How do you know?"

758
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,792
I said, "I don't know the woman.
I've never met her.

759
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:37,628
But I know this. There is no scenario

760
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,631
where Mariah Carey finishes a concert,

761
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,884
goes home, pours herself a bath,
lights a few candles,

762
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,928
and goes, 'Put on a bit of Jim Jefferies.'

763
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,807
And then sits there splashing around,
going, 'Women <i>are </i>cunts!'

764
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,766
No."

765
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,396
I said, "She's not a fan."

766
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,445
So they ring back and they go...
Her fiance at the time...

767
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,655
"Her fiance, James Packer, is a fan."

768
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:08,367
Now, James Packer is a very famous
Australian billionaire.

769
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:13,539
And she wanted to purchase me
for his 50th birthday

770
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,499
as a gift, right?

771
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,338
Already weird, to be a human gift.

772
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,008
But I guess that's
what you buy billionaires.

773
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,801
You can't buy them materialistic things,

774
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:28,054
'cause they can purchase
whatever they want.

775
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,598
You buy them
other human beings doing tricks.

776
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:37,313
So they ring me up, and they go...

777
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,069
They go, "$15,000, 15 minutes.
You just gotta perform at a dinner party.

778
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:46,489
She lives half a mile away from you.
Easy-peasy.

779
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,616
And I said to my manager, Alex,

780
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,369
I said, "Alex, that sounds
fucking horrible.

781
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,496
I'm not gonna do that."

782
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:55,790
And he rings back up ten minutes later,

783
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,375
"$30,000...

784
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,794
15 minutes."

785
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,587
And I said, "Alex...

786
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,006
I'm an artist."

787
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,595
"I never let money make decisions for me."

788
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:12,848
Now, I think we all know
where this is headed.

789
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,606
They rang back, "$60,000, 12 minutes,"

790
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,608
and I was like,
"Fuck it, what's your address?"

791
00:48:25,528 --> 00:48:26,487
So three weeks later...

792
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,657
So for three weeks
I was just dreading this gig,

793
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,993
and then three weeks later, it's like,
all right, I show up at the house.

794
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,538
I'm there in the middle of summer.

795
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,623
I'm wearing a leather jacket
and fucking T-shirt,

796
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,125
I'm sweating my ass off,

797
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,918
and I'm there with my manager, Alex,

798
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,588
and someone...
Mariah's assistant opens the door,

799
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,966
and goes,
"Which one of you is Jim Jefferies?"

800
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:48,759
I'm like...

801
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,554
The fucking career is crushing it,
obviously.

802
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,513
Uh...

803
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,183
I said, "That's me," and she goes,
"We've been waiting for you,"

804
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:58,853
and she goes, "You're not to be seen.
You're a surprise."

805
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:02,314
And I get into the house, she's like,
"Oh! Take your shoes off!"

806
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,108
Mariah's one of those cunts.

807
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,030
Soon as you enter your house,

808
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,867
you gotta feel uncomfortable,
take your fucking shoes off.

809
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,787
I don't know if we have any of those
Nazi fucking pricks in this room,

810
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,873
but you've lost
a lot of friends over this,

811
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,749
you fucking lowlife cunts.

812
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:23,127
Anyway...

813
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,839
So I take my shoes off.

814
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,467
I'm the birthday surprise,
so no one's to see me,

815
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,677
so they secretly get me into the kitchen.

816
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,095
So I go into the kitchen.

817
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:36,223
I'm sitting there, and then they give me
some rich people food,

818
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,393
which is the same as poor people food
but has truffles on it.

819
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,981
I'm sitting there eating
my fucking truffley food...

820
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:50,446
I look at my manager, like, "I shouldn't
be here. It's the worst idea I ever had."

821
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,199
- I shouldn't do this."
- He's like, "It's going to be fine.

822
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,700
It'll be great. You'll do great."

823
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,786
At that stage,
Eddie Murphy walks into the kitchen.

824
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:02,249
Now, Eddie Murphy,
and I want this on film,

825
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:04,293
is my childhood fucking hero.

826
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,795
<i>Delirious </i>was such a big deal to me.

827
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:13,302
And was the reason
that I tell these big long stories.

828
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,971
He was the first comic I saw
who told long stories.

829
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:18,349
Anyway, I'm gonna do
a terrible impersonation,

830
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,477
but Eddie Murphy walks up
to one of the catering people,

831
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,979
he goes, "I'm all dehydrated.

832
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,067
I need a Gatorade or a Powerade
or something with 'ade.'

833
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,737
I need electrolytes. My mouth is dry."

834
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,325
And I'm just staring at him, like...

835
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,039
Then he points at me, he goes,
"Oh, I know you.

836
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,625
You do the TV show with the disabled boy."

837
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,170
And I said, "I <i>do </i>do the TV show
with the disabled boy!"

838
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,923
And he goes, "I love that show.
It's a fantastic show.

839
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:54,301
You're masturbating off a little disabled
boy in the sky. What a great show it was.

840
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,095
What are you doing here?"

841
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:59,223
And I said, "I'm gonna do stand-up
for the dinner party!"

842
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:02,434
And he went, "There's no way that's
gonna work out," and he just fucked off.

843
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:11,944
So I just break out
into a fucking sweat, right?

844
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:14,697
And then Mariah's assistant
comes up to me,

845
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,156
and she goes, "It's time."

846
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,033
Now, let me paint a picture for you.

847
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,788
There's 20 people in a garden,
sitting at a long table,

848
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:24,373
surrounded by tiki torches

849
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:26,875
before tiki torches had
racist connotations.

850
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,337
They're all famous people.

851
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:33,549
They do not know
that there's any entertainment.

852
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,177
Nor have I been announced.

853
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:40,389
There is not a microphone.

854
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:42,808
There is not a light.

855
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,729
I'm walking out in my socks.

856
00:51:50,024 --> 00:51:53,402
I just look like a guy
who's gotten onto the property...

857
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:59,074
And has a few things
that he wants to say.

858
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,914
See, the difference
between stand-up comedy

859
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,499
and a drunk guy giving opinions?

860
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,669
That's it.

861
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,466
So I walk out, and so,

862
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:19,053
Mariah Carey's here, James Packer's here,
Eddie Murphy's here.

863
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,388
Al Pacino's here, Warren Beatty's here,

864
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,432
and it gets less and less
famous as we go along.

865
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,103
So I walk out, I've never done
a birthday party before,

866
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,064
so I just treat it
like a kid's birthday party.

867
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:34,151
So I walk up to a 50-year-old man,
and I go, "Hey, hey!"

868
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,988
"Happy birthday!"

869
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:41,533
And he went, "Who are you?"

870
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,786
And I went, "Who am I?

871
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,331
I'm Jim Jefferies,
your favorite comedian!"

872
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:51,293
And he goes, "I don't know you."

873
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,297
And I pointed at Mariah,
and I said, "Mariah!"

874
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,801
And Mariah's on her seventh Xanax
of the fucking day.

875
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,597
And she just looks over at him and goes,

876
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:07,726
"Remember? We watched him
on the computer doing something."

877
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:12,314
It was very clear that they were towards
the end of their relationship,

878
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:15,693
because he was just like,
"Why do you talk?"

879
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,075
And I went, "Fuck it!

880
00:53:23,951 --> 00:53:26,370
I'll tell some jokes anyway, shall I?"

881
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:29,665
At that stage,

882
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:33,377
Leonardo DiCaprio walks in
with three of the hottest chicks

883
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,838
I've ever seen in my fucking life.

884
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,965
He has it big,
'cause he just did that movie

885
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,259
where he had sex with a bear.
I haven't seen it.

886
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,054
He walks up. He stands next to me.

887
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,599
Everyone greets him
like he's Norm from <i>Cheers,</i> right?

888
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,936
Somehow, this cunt gets
to keep his shoes on.

889
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,362
And he just chats to the table
for three minutes.

890
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,030
So for three minutes,

891
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,324
I'm standing
next to Leonardo DiCaprio like this...

892
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:12,666
After three minutes,
he doesn't even look at me.

893
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,419
He just points at me and goes,
"What's all this about?"

894
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,465
And Warren Beatty went, "We don't know!"

895
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:26,346
Then Leonardo DiCaprio
took the women over,

896
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,140
and sat on some garden furniture,

897
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,601
and I was like,
"Fuck it, I'll just go do 12 minutes.

898
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,146
No one says anyone has to laugh,
I just gotta fucking talk, right?"

899
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,857
So I just started phoning in
some fucking jokes.

900
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,985
I just looked at them and went,
"There's a turtle at my kid's school,"

901
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,653
and I told the turtle routine,

902
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:46,033
and I'm just fucking walking around
telling the fucking turtle routine.

903
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,369
James Packer is getting angrier
and angrier, just like...

904
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,038
"Fucking..."

905
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,874
At one stage, he says to Mariah Carey

906
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,794
at the same volume
that I'm talking next to him,

907
00:54:56,877 --> 00:54:59,797
he says, "Why did you think
I'd enjoy this?"

908
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,256
Right?

909
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,261
And I'm like, "Just keep smiling, Jim.

910
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,390
Keep a song in your heart,
and they can't hurt you."

911
00:55:15,521 --> 00:55:18,690
So I keep going,
and he's getting angrier and angrier,

912
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,734
and he just goes like this...

913
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,660
"Gun control!"

914
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:31,245
And I said, "Yes!"

915
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:36,083
"I'm the gun control guy!"

916
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,876
And he goes, "I love that bit.

917
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:40,671
Do that bit."

918
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:45,425
And I said, "I haven't performed that
in over a year.

919
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:47,135
I really don't know how it goes,"

920
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,887
and he went, "Just fucking do it."

921
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,849
And I went, "Okay!"

922
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,643
So I started doing the gun control thing.

923
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:57,980
So I'm like running across the lawn
to do the fucking safe thing.

924
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:00,482
Now, that routine...

925
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,068
is 16-and-a-half minutes long.

926
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,030
I go through it in eight minutes.

927
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,285
'Cause it turns out,
it's shorter without laughter.

928
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,466
I did get a laugh, though.

929
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,802
I got a laugh from James Packer.

930
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,139
At the halfway moment during the routine,

931
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:36,560
he just gave this,
like, Australian billionaire...

932
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,563
guttural fucking laugh.

933
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,939
He just went, "Ha!"

934
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:46,737
This laugh is so distinctive
to my Australian ear,

935
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:49,907
that if I was in the Outback,
and I heard it,

936
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:51,992
I would become like Steve Irwin,

937
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,953
and be like,
"Oh! That's the Australian billionaire."

938
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,251
And then he just went...

939
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:05,547
Because it was his birthday,
it was like a moment in a medieval film

940
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,257
where the king started laughing,

941
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:11,178
and the rest of the courtyard was like,
"The King is amused!"

942
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,765
They all started laughing a little bit,

943
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:17,601
and all of a sudden,
I wasn't having a good gig,

944
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,227
but I was getting away with it.

945
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:25,442
So I finish up the show and I did
a routine that was on my last special

946
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,236
about how I'm a five
in the looks department,

947
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,365
but because I'm on TV
I get to fuck sixes and sevens,

948
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,743
but because I'm an alcoholic,
I fuck fours and threes.

949
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,584
So I did that routine, then afterwards,
I'm standing around with my manager, Alex,

950
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,086
and we're drinking,

951
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,838
and Al Pacino and Warren Beatty
walk up to us

952
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,174
and they're drunk as fuck, or...

953
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,842
they're just old.

954
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:57,015
And Al Pacino walks up to me,

955
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,977
and this is the exact words
he says, he went, "Oh!

956
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,147
A couple of fives
are talking to each other."

957
00:58:09,236 --> 00:58:11,613
And I forgot my routine,
I'm like, "Sorry?"

958
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,991
And he goes, "I'm a five.

959
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:16,660
You're also a five."

960
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:22,582
Then I remembered, I went,
"Well, I get to fuck sixes and sevens

961
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,334
because I'm on the TV.

962
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:27,087
I bet you're fucking crazy nines
and tens, right?"

963
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,047
And he grabs one of the girls with Leo,

964
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,425
and he drags her,
and he goes, "You're right."

965
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:35,721
Then he pushed her away,

966
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:39,016
and then Harvey Weinstein tackled her
and dragged her into the bushes.

967
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,899
And then he goes like this,
he goes, "I like what you do.

968
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,777
You tell stories.

969
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:54,740
Nobody tells stories anymore."

970
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,329
"You tell a story, I'm enjoying myself.

971
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,248
Oh, I'm enjoying myself.

972
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,085
But then you get distracted
and go on a tangent,

973
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:08,503
and I think, 'Oh, no...

974
00:59:10,422 --> 00:59:12,257
I'll never hear the end of this tale.'"

975
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:18,472
But then you come back to the story,
"and I'm like, 'Wow!

976
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,099
He remembered the whole time.'"

977
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,234
And then he kept talking
for, like, ten minutes

978
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,695
and at the ten minute mark,
I hadn't said a word,

979
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:35,489
and he literally said, he goes,

980
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:37,741
"You haven't said anything!"

981
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:42,120
"Am I talking too much?"

982
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,790
And I said, "Mr. Pacino,

983
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:47,626
this is one of the greatest moments
of my life.

984
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,961
Please keep talking till I come."

985
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,679
And he said, "A challenge!"

986
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,936
Then he said to me, he goes, "Do you act?"

987
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,855
Al Pacino says, "Do you act?"
and I'm like,

988
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,273
"I've acted.

989
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,610
I'm not an actor. I'm a comedian."

990
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,654
And he goes, "Oh!

991
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,573
I know a lot about acting,"

992
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:21,201
and I was like, "Yeah you do."

993
01:00:23,495 --> 01:00:26,206
And he's like,
"You're going to be a great actor!

994
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,374
A great actor!"

995
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:30,168
And I'm like a fat chick being hit on.
I'm like...

996
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:38,593
Then he went, "No, fuck it!

997
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:39,970
Don't act!

998
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,597
You're better than us.

999
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,516
Acting's for idiots like me and him.

1000
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,602
He points at Warren Beatty,
and Warren Beatty, at this stage,

1001
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:50,021
is looking at a moth going
around a tiki torch, like...

1002
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,735
He goes, "You're better than us.

1003
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:58,029
You tell stories.

1004
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:00,991
You're a director."

1005
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,578
And I'm like, "All right."

1006
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,498
He's like, "Say it for me.

1007
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,710
Say, 'I'm a director.'"

1008
01:01:17,257 --> 01:01:19,551
I went "I'm a director."

1009
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,555
And he went, "Say it again!"

1010
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,642
And I went, "I'm a director."

1011
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,188
And he goes, "One more time.

1012
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:36,693
But this time I need more passion
from you, George Jamison."

1013
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,869
So I just got the fever and I went,

1014
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,579
"I'm a director!"

1015
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:50,040
Everyone there stopped
what the fuck they were doing.

1016
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,792
They all stared at me, and I went,
"I don't know what's going on."

1017
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,671
Warren Beatty's all confused.

1018
01:01:56,755 --> 01:01:58,924
He leans over and goes, "Um...

1019
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,302
What do you direct?"

1020
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:07,849
You know when you're a kid in your teens,
you just lie all the time?

1021
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:11,478
But you don't really lie past 30.
You lie to get yourself out of trouble.

1022
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,357
Lies like, "I don't know that girl,
I was somewhere else."

1023
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,483
Right?

1024
01:02:19,653 --> 01:02:22,989
I just did one of those teenage lies.
He goes, "What do you direct?"

1025
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,284
And I said,
"I've directed two independent films...

1026
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:30,372
and I have a big budget film
in the works with Warner Bros."

1027
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:36,920
And then Warren Beatty
looks at me and goes, "Um...

1028
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,881
How can we stay in touch?"

1029
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,425
And I just went...

1030
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,596
"I'm fucking lying, man."

1031
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:51,476
And before I could say anything else,

1032
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,062
my manager saw that I was
drowning in this conversation,

1033
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,606
he swooped in, so Hollywood-y,
he goes,

1034
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,317
"I love this.
Jim Jefferies, Warren Beatty,

1035
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,236
you're gonna make a lot
of great films together.

1036
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:04,322
Here's what we're gonna do.
You're gonna take my number, Warren,

1037
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:06,283
I'm gonna take yours.
We're gonna stay in touch."

1038
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:08,994
They start swapping numbers
and I'm standing off to the side,

1039
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,954
like, "I don't know
what the fuck this is."

1040
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,708
Before I could say anything stupid,
Alex puts his arm around me,

1041
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,293
and drags me out of the party.

1042
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:19,504
I'm like, "I don't know
what just happened, Alex."

1043
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,882
He turned me and went, "You're gonna
have to learn how to direct."

1044
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:38,148
Now, before we go, on all my specials,
I do this little bit at the end.

1045
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,567
Um, I mention depression.

1046
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:46,072
Depression has been something
that has been a major part of my life.

1047
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,075
Not just my life, but my father's life,

1048
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,036
and it has sort of controlled...

1049
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,414
um, everything for me.

1050
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:58,460
Now, if you're suffering
from depression...

1051
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:02,172
As I hit 40, it's gotten a bit better.

1052
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:04,799
And it's gotten a bit better

1053
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,802
because I was speaking to my dad,
who's 76,

1054
01:04:07,886 --> 01:04:09,763
and I said,
"Dad, why aren't you depressed?"

1055
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,139
And he said, "Ah...

1056
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:13,308
what are you going to do?"

1057
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,226
Now...

1058
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:20,398
That actually said something to me.

1059
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,276
It said something big in my brain,
actually,

1060
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,236
it flicked a switch.

1061
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:29,240
All right, 'cause I wasted my 20s
being depressed,

1062
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:30,950
the prime years of my life.

1063
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,578
I wasted most of my 30s being depressed,

1064
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,663
and a lot of you
may have done that as well.

1065
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:37,916
But this is the thing, right?

1066
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:43,296
The only reason we're depressed
in our 20s and our 30s and our 40s,

1067
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,507
the prime of our life, is because of hope.

1068
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:55,892
'Cause we think that something better
is fucking coming, right?

1069
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,938
You think you're gonna make it.
You think you're gonna be something.

1070
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,065
"What if I don't meet the woman
of my dreams?"

1071
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:04,401
"What if I don't get the career I want?"

1072
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:06,861
And then when you're old, you go, "Ha!"

1073
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:13,993
"I guess none of that happened."

1074
01:05:16,538 --> 01:05:17,997
But then you're happy to be alive.

1075
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:22,794
See, I spent weeks, in my 20s,
in my fucking bed

1076
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,589
going, "I don't want to live.
I can't get out of my fucking bed."

1077
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,259
You know who doesn't do that?

1078
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,678
People in their 90s.

1079
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,974
You don't meet depressed people
in their 90s.

1080
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,559
I used to be like, "I can't get up."

1081
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,436
People in their 90s are like, "I'm up!"

1082
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,730
"Did it again! Boom!"

1083
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:56,453
So all you have to do
is outlive your depression.

1084
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:04,669
And then embrace the things
that make you fucking weird.

1085
01:06:05,044 --> 01:06:08,173
All right, I'm 40, about to turn 41
in a few weeks, and...

1086
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,427
I'll tell you a weird thing about me.

1087
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:13,470
I have a passion.

1088
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,138
My passion is this.

1089
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,892
I like little things
that look like they should be big things.

1090
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,311
I act like they're full-size,

1091
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:22,812
but that I'm a giant.

1092
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,193
I'll give you an example.
When you're in a shitty hotel,

1093
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:30,111
they give you
a little box of breakfast cereal?

1094
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:32,864
I act like that's a full-size box
of breakfast cereal.

1095
01:06:34,449 --> 01:06:35,742
Then I walk up to people and go,

1096
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,453
"This is a full-size box
of breakfast cereal.

1097
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:40,580
I'm a giant!"

1098
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:47,670
Like, my ex, Kate, she had to stop buying
cherry tomatoes and baby carrots,

1099
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:49,714
'cause whenever we had them
in the house...

1100
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:53,426
I was a pain in the ass.
I was always like, "Kate!

1101
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:57,222
It's a regular size tomato!

1102
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,725
I'm gonna eat it in one bite!

1103
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,895
'Cause I'm a giant, Kate!"

1104
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,857
Every time we went to a restaurant
and I ordered sliders,

1105
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,734
she was like, "Fuck, here we go."

1106
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:13,905
You don't wanna be sitting next to me
on a plane

1107
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,282
when you get that little bottle of vodka.
I'm a nightmare.

1108
01:07:17,909 --> 01:07:19,953
I'm like...

1109
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,580
"Everyone, I should be drunk!

1110
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,625
I just drank a whole bottle of vodka.

1111
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:28,545
But I'm not...

1112
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,755
'cause I'm a giant!"

1113
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,884
Now, this all came to a head
when my son was two.

1114
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,179
We were trying to put him in preschool,

1115
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:41,182
and we went around to the different
schools, we're taking the tours,

1116
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:44,477
and we were on this one tour,
at the school he actually ended up at,

1117
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:47,272
and they were showing us the
play equipment in the classrooms,

1118
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:49,148
and then we walked into the toilets.

1119
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:54,112
And they had these toilets
for two-year-olds,

1120
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:57,156
which had little tiny bowls,
a little tiny seat,

1121
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,492
a little tiny water thing,
and a little tiny flusher,

1122
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,869
and as soon as I saw them...

1123
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,374
I was in heaven.

1124
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,335
And the rest of the group kept walking,

1125
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,921
and I acted like I was walking,
but I wasn't.

1126
01:08:12,547 --> 01:08:14,090
'Cause I had to stick around,

1127
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:17,176
because I had to do a shit
on a little toilet.

1128
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,471
I didn't even need to do a shit.

1129
01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,682
This was an extra unnecessary shit.

1130
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,393
I had done a shit two hours earlier.

1131
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:30,398
So I pull down my pants,
and I get on the little toilet, now,

1132
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,984
maybe the happiest I've ever been.

1133
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:37,905
So I'm doing this shit,
and the hole's so small,

1134
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:41,367
it only covers my asshole,
so my cock and balls are sitting up...

1135
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,537
on the lip of the seat,

1136
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:47,081
and I'm just beaming,
but then I reach a dilemma.

1137
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,460
Often, when you shit,
you also need to wee.

1138
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:54,297
And my dick wanted to wee,

1139
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,842
but I was just shitting,
so my dick was confused.

1140
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:02,472
My dick was like, "Name me a scenario
where shit is welcome and wee isn't."

1141
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:07,977
I'm like, "We're just shitting right now."

1142
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,855
It's like, "Fuck it, I'm gonna wee,"
and I'm like, "Please don't wee!

1143
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:13,650
'Cause if you wee,
I'll become a sex offender,

1144
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,610
and Hank won't get into the school...

1145
01:09:15,943 --> 01:09:17,195
and Kate won't get happy."

1146
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,488
Now, at this stage,

1147
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:21,366
Kate realizes I've left the group.

1148
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:24,327
And she walks back in

1149
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,122
to see the father of her child
doing a shit on a little toilet,

1150
01:09:28,206 --> 01:09:30,583
with his cock and balls
sitting up on the lip.

1151
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,380
The look of disappointment
that just flooded her face...

1152
01:09:36,422 --> 01:09:38,049
I just looked at her like this.

1153
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,973
"I'm a giant, Kate!"

1154
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,770
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.

1155
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,480
I loved every minute of it.
