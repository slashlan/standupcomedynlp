<font color=#0080C0>Oh, my God.</font>

5
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:35,786
<font color=#0080C0>Oh, my God.</font>

6
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,913
<font color=#0080C0>I see you.</font>

7
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,790
<font color=#0080C0>I see you.</font>

8
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:44,795
<font color=#0080C0>Wow. Oh, my God!</font>

00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:51,886
<font color=#0080C0>You guys.</font>

10
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:57,641
<font color=#0080C0>You guys, don't.
It's not waterproof.</font>

11
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:03,939
<font color=#0080C0>I can't,
I'm gonna cry off my eyelashes.</font>

12
00:01:04,023 --> 00:01:05,399
<font color=#0080C0>Guys, I can't thank you enough.</font>

13
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,735
<font color=#0080C0>What an incredible welcome.
Wow.</font>

14
00:01:07,818 --> 00:01:09,737
<font color=#0080C0>Uh,
I'm excited for you to be here.</font>

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,822
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you for coming to
El Museo del Barrio.</font>

16
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,785
<font color=#0080C0>I love that we're here, uh,
in this historic place,</font>

17
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,412
<font color=#0080C0>and it--
it was so important to me to do this special</font>

18
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,164
<font color=#0080C0>in New York.</font>

19
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,001
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah.</font>

20
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,007
<font color=#0080C0>I-- I love this city.</font>

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,009
<font color=#0080C0>Like, I love this city,
I'm a native New Yorker,</font>

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,677
<font color=#0080C0>I'm born and raised here.</font>

23
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,596
<font color=#0080C0>And when you're born
and raised in New York,</font>

24
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:38,265
<font color=#0080C0>you know New York
ain't for everybody.</font>

25
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,352
<font color=#0080C0>That's how we like it.</font>

26
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:46,232
<font color=#0080C0>We don't want anybody just rollin'
up in here.</font>

27
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,025
<font color=#0080C0>Right?
'Cause people come to New York</font>

28
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,321
<font color=#0080C0>and then they complain
about being in New York.</font>

29
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:54,740
<font color=#0080C0>And we're like,
then go.</font>

30
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,952
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah.</font>

31
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,668
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
we did not request your presence.</font>

32
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,920
<font color=#0080C0>You just showed up.</font>

33
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,756
<font color=#0080C0>Then they walk around the city
complaining about everything,</font>

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,259
<font color=#0080C0>like, New York is so gross.</font>

35
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,387
<font color=#0080C0>New York is so gross.</font>

36
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,264
<font color=#0080C0>I'm, like, really?</font>

37
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:21,100
<font color=#0080C0>People don't openly poop in the
streets where you come from?</font>

38
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,480
<font color=#0080C0>Well, then,
where you live is lame.</font>

39
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,650
<font color=#0080C0>Spice it up.</font>

40
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,696
<font color=#0080C0>Are you guys--
You guys seem so ready.</font>

41
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:36,031
<font color=#0080C0>Are you guys ready
to receive comedy?</font>

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,869
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you.</font>

43
00:02:39,952 --> 00:02:41,912
<font color=#0080C0>I always feel like I need to
poll the audience now</font>

44
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,330
<font color=#0080C0>'cause there's so much
sensitivity,</font>

45
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:44,999
<font color=#0080C0>I feel like
I have to be like,</font>

46
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:47,459
<font color=#0080C0>are you guys in a safe space
for some jokes?</font>

47
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,967
<font color=#0080C0>Can you guys forget your
trauma for a few minutes?</font>

48
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,386
<font color=#0080C0>While I tell you about mine?</font>

49
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,724
<font color=#0080C0>I try,
I try to be sensitive to everything,</font>

50
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,101
<font color=#0080C0>but I'm losing myself
in this PC world of</font>

51
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,769
<font color=#0080C0>being so correct,</font>

52
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,771
<font color=#0080C0>I don't know what to
call people anymore.</font>

53
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,356
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
I don't know what to call my garbage man,</font>

54
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,025
<font color=#0080C0>a garbage person?</font>

55
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,318
<font color=#0080C0>That seems harsh.</font>

56
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:19,366
<font color=#0080C0>Like, if somebody were to
tell me I'm a garbage person,</font>

57
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,952
<font color=#0080C0>I'd be like, no,
you have such a good heart.</font>

58
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,915
<font color=#0080C0>Why would you say that?</font>

59
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:29,168
<font color=#0080C0>You're so fun and so kind.</font>

60
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,461
<font color=#0080C0>They're like, no, Gina,</font>

61
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,838
<font color=#0080C0>I pick up trash for a living.</font>

62
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,674
<font color=#0080C0>You're an Uber driver?
That's crazy.</font>

63
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,433
<font color=#0080C0>I take Uber, too,
I'm trash.</font>

64
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:49,480
<font color=#0080C0>I do.
My favorite new game is lying to Uber drivers</font>

65
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,857
<font color=#0080C0>about what I do for a living.</font>

66
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,984
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I used to stupidly
tell them the truth.</font>

67
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,611
<font color=#0080C0>I'd tell them I'm a comedian,</font>

68
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,280
<font color=#0080C0>and they'd be like,
"Say something funny."</font>

69
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,532
<font color=#0080C0>But when I tell 'em I'm a stripper,
no more questions.</font>

70
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,248
<font color=#0080C0>You don't want to know about
my relationship with my father?</font>

71
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:11,919
<font color=#0080C0>Seems like an obvious line
of questioning.</font>

72
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,630
<font color=#0080C0>Last time I got in a car,
the guy asked my what I did for a living,</font>

73
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:17,758
<font color=#0080C0>I was like, sir,
I'm not at liberty to discuss that.</font>

74
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,218
<font color=#0080C0>Please keep your eyes
on the road.</font>

75
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,765
<font color=#0080C0>And then I just started wiping my
fingerprints off of everything.</font>

76
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,851
<font color=#0080C0>He was so scared.</font>

77
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:32,398
<font color=#0080C0>Like I said,
I'm a native New Yorker,</font>

78
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,275
<font color=#0080C0>I'm born and raised in
the South Bronx in New York.</font>

79
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,863
<font color=#0080C0>Woo! Yay.
I see you.</font>

80
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,034
<font color=#0080C0>Greetings, gangsters.</font>

81
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:52,418
<font color=#0080C0>A hardy year to all of you.</font>

82
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,716
<font color=#0080C0>Being from the Bronx,
there's always gonna be, like,</font>

83
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,385
<font color=#0080C0>a 'hood side to me.</font>

84
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,012
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
there's always gonna be 'hood in me,</font>

85
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,430
<font color=#0080C0>like, there's 'hood me,</font>

86
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,306
<font color=#0080C0>and then there's evolved me.</font>

87
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,853
<font color=#0080C0>But 'hood me is still there.</font>

88
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,733
<font color=#0080C0>Like, evolved me knows that
hurt people hurt people.</font>

89
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,234
<font color=#0080C0>But 'hood me
just wants to hurt people,</font>

90
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,485
<font color=#0080C0>she don't care about
your back story.</font>

91
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,533
<font color=#0080C0>They're constantly battling
for control.</font>

92
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,828
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
'hood me and evolved me.</font>

93
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:30,414
<font color=#0080C0>I gotta leave 'hood me
repressed.</font>

94
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:33,792
<font color=#0080C0>I keep her repressed...</font>

95
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:36,336
<font color=#0080C0>until I get angry.</font>

96
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,588
<font color=#0080C0>That's when the 'hood spirit</font>

97
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,423
<font color=#0080C0>inhabits my body
against my will.</font>

98
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,761
<font color=#0080C0>And I can't control
what happens.</font>

99
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,680
<font color=#0080C0>And it scares people 'cause
they don't expect it from me.</font>

100
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,057
<font color=#0080C0>It scares my husband.</font>

101
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,728
<font color=#0080C0>It do.</font>

102
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,480
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I'll be like, "Honey,
can you take out the garbage?"</font>

103
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,523
<font color=#0080C0>And if he says
the wrong thing.</font>

104
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,818
<font color=#0080C0>I'll be like,
"Oh, word!"</font>

105
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,282
<font color=#0080C0>"Oh, we fightin' now?"</font>

106
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,326
<font color=#0080C0>"Okay, okay, you know what?
I'ma calm down</font>

107
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,577
<font color=#0080C0>before I key our car."</font>

108
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,372
<font color=#0080C0>Say I won't.
Wish you would say I won't.</font>

109
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:21,340
<font color=#0080C0>That's why I gotta let
evolved me run the show.</font>

110
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,468
<font color=#0080C0>She's gotta navigate through
the non 'hood world.</font>

111
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,345
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause sometimes you want to
handle something</font>

112
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,638
<font color=#0080C0>like you would on the block.</font>

113
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:29,098
<font color=#0080C0>Right? 'Cause I be like,</font>

114
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,809
<font color=#0080C0>on my block,
this would be a fight.</font>

115
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,144
<font color=#0080C0>But I can't beat you down
in a boardroom.</font>

116
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,650
<font color=#0080C0>So now I gotta figure a way
to verbally beat you down.</font>

117
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,193
<font color=#0080C0>You know,
still sound intelligent,</font>

118
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,028
<font color=#0080C0>not use the F word.</font>

119
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,072
<font color=#0080C0>I gotta Rubik's Cube
some words together.</font>

120
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:51,078
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
I don't mean to be offensive but...</font>

121
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:54,498
<font color=#0080C0>I'm not tryin'
to hurt your feelings.</font>

122
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,042
<font color=#0080C0>All because I cannot take
the "are you stupid?"</font>

123
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,585
<font color=#0080C0>out of my tone.</font>

124
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,758
<font color=#0080C0>It's such a struggle.</font>

125
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,468
<font color=#0080C0>It really is.</font>

126
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:11,223
<font color=#0080C0>It is such a struggle.</font>

127
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,058
<font color=#0080C0>No matter what I say,
if I don't like you,</font>

128
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:14,685
<font color=#0080C0>I could say good morning,
and you'll be like,</font>

129
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,936
<font color=#0080C0>"What the hell did you
just say to me?"</font>

130
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,107
<font color=#0080C0>I'll be like,
"I said good morning."</font>

131
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,696
<font color=#0080C0>"Honey, call the police."</font>

132
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,283
<font color=#0080C0>By the way,
when I say I'm 'hood,</font>

133
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:30,659
<font color=#0080C0>I'm not Cardi B 'hood,</font>

134
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,994
<font color=#0080C0>I'm, like, Drake 'hood.</font>

135
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,747
<font color=#0080C0>Like, I'm not dangerous,</font>

136
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:38,000
<font color=#0080C0>but I will be
the scariest person in Canada.</font>

137
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,968
<font color=#0080C0>I just celebrated my two year
wedding anniversary</font>

138
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:49,219
<font color=#0080C0>not too long ago.</font>

139
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,305
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah.</font>

140
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,056
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah.</font>

141
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,683
<font color=#0080C0>You can clap,
I like him.</font>

142
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,437
<font color=#0080C0>I appreciate those of y'all
who held your applause</font>

143
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,105
<font color=#0080C0>to make sure
I was happy first.</font>

144
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:03,859
<font color=#0080C0>It was like, "Huh?
Oh, she good, she good."</font>

145
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,527
<font color=#0080C0>I got a good one,
I married a good dude,</font>

146
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,821
<font color=#0080C0>I got me a 1978 Caucasian.</font>

147
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,537
<font color=#0080C0>My husband's white,
that's what I'm tryin' to tell y'all.</font>

148
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:21,251
<font color=#0080C0>He's not just white,
he is Midwest white.</font>

149
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,669
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah, that's right,
that's organic, girl.</font>

150
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,379
<font color=#0080C0>That is--</font>

151
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,423
<font color=#0080C0>Whoo!</font>

152
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,302
<font color=#0080C0>That is farm to table white,
y'all, like that--</font>

153
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,721
<font color=#0080C0>I went to the source
to get my white man.</font>

154
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,767
<font color=#0080C0>I am not white,
I am Puerto Rican,</font>

155
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,893
<font color=#0080C0>which, uh--</font>

156
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,187
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah.</font>

157
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,772
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah!</font>

158
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,566
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you, thank you,
thank you.</font>

159
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,443
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you,
probably my cousins.</font>

160
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:52,199
<font color=#0080C0>You know how we get around.</font>

161
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,786
<font color=#0080C0>My husband loves the fact that
he's married a sassy Latina.</font>

162
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,456
<font color=#0080C0>He loves to bring it up
in conversation</font>

163
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,585
<font color=#0080C0>when it has nothing to do with
what we're talking about.</font>

164
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:05,003
<font color=#0080C0>He'll be like,
"Hey, guys.</font>

165
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,256
<font color=#0080C0>"My wife's Puerto Rican.</font>

166
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,340
<font color=#0080C0>Enjoy your meal."</font>

167
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:15,097
<font color=#0080C0>I get it, I mean,
he's excited.</font>

168
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,974
<font color=#0080C0>I'm the only Latin woman
he's ever been with,</font>

169
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,059
<font color=#0080C0>so I'm his first.</font>

170
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,688
<font color=#0080C0>He's not my first white guy.
I have a--</font>

171
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,152
<font color=#0080C0>I've been with white guys
before.</font>

172
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,989
<font color=#0080C0>Mainly to get information
and take it back to my people.</font>

173
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,871
<font color=#0080C0>I like how most of y'all
laughed.</font>

174
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:43,583
<font color=#0080C0>Some of y'all were like,
"I knew it."</font>

175
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,171
<font color=#0080C0>"I knew that was their plans
for world domination."</font>

176
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,591
<font color=#0080C0>First white guy I dated
was years ago.</font>

177
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,926
<font color=#0080C0>He took me to his parents'
lake house,</font>

178
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,137
<font color=#0080C0>and I was like, oh.</font>

179
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,014
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause that's when I found out
white people buy houses</font>

180
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,056
<font color=#0080C0>that they don't live in.</font>

181
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,354
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
that's money money.</font>

182
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,651
<font color=#0080C0>How many sub houses
do y'all have?</font>

183
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:11,278
<font color=#0080C0>They had fancy food
at the lake house.</font>

184
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,447
<font color=#0080C0>I remember this because
I was traumatized.</font>

185
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,825
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I wasn't used to that,</font>

186
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,702
<font color=#0080C0>so I kept messin'
up and eatin' the decorations</font>

187
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,203
<font color=#0080C0>thinkin'
they were part of the food.</font>

188
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,587
<font color=#0080C0>Because fancy food is food
that's decorated with other food.</font>

189
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,630
<font color=#0080C0>And then you gotta figure out
what part of that</font>

190
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,425
<font color=#0080C0>you're supposed to eat.</font>

191
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,760
<font color=#0080C0>That's the game.</font>

192
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,512
<font color=#0080C0>We've all been through it,
right?</font>

193
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,306
<font color=#0080C0>You go to a posh restaurant,</font>

194
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,142
<font color=#0080C0>you order what you think is
an adult size meal.</font>

195
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:48,440
<font color=#0080C0>And they come at you with
a shrimp on a spinach leaf.</font>

196
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,109
<font color=#0080C0>And a radish
shaped like a rose.</font>

197
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,778
<font color=#0080C0>That's what they had
at the lake house,</font>

198
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,864
<font color=#0080C0>I ate the whole thing.
I ate the whole thing.</font>

199
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,450
<font color=#0080C0>Here's a pro tip:
if you eat the whole thing,</font>

200
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:02,204
<font color=#0080C0>your boyfriend's parents will talk to
you like you're an idiot the whole night.</font>

201
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,414
<font color=#0080C0>I ate it, whole thing,
and they were like,</font>

202
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,458
<font color=#0080C0>"The radish was a garnish."</font>

203
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,462
<font color=#0080C0>"Can you say garnish?"</font>

204
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,468
<font color=#0080C0>I was like, "Garnish?
Ain't that a Hindu god?"</font>

205
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,973
<font color=#0080C0>Uh-uh-uh.</font>

206
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,605
<font color=#0080C0>I grew up broke, man,
we don't know nothin' about no garnishes.</font>

207
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,482
<font color=#0080C0>Not unless you're talkin'
about our wages.</font>

208
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:42,702
<font color=#0080C0>Some of y'all remember some
bills you gotta pay right now?</font>

209
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,663
<font color=#0080C0>Is that goin'
through your head right now?</font>

210
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,874
<font color=#0080C0>And when I say
I grew up broke,</font>

211
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:51,128
<font color=#0080C0>I can always feel the rich people
in the room's hearts break.</font>

212
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,212
<font color=#0080C0>Whenever I say it,
they're always like--</font>

213
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,009
<font color=#0080C0>"You didn't even have
a little bit of a lot of money?"</font>

214
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,432
<font color=#0080C0>"How did you live?"</font>

215
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,350
<font color=#0080C0>I didn't know we were broke,
man.</font>

216
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:08,228
<font color=#0080C0>I didn't know we were broke
until I was about, like, 13,</font>

217
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,938
<font color=#0080C0>that's when the reveal
happened.</font>

218
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,651
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I volunteered at
a neighborhood food drive</font>

219
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,987
<font color=#0080C0>and one of the bags
was for my family.</font>

220
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,701
<font color=#0080C0>Imagine my surprise.</font>

221
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:24,828
<font color=#0080C0>I showed up,
I was like,</font>

222
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,289
<font color=#0080C0>"Who are we helping today?"</font>

223
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,459
<font color=#0080C0>They're like, "Help yourself,
Gina, grab a bag, get outta here."</font>

224
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,295
<font color=#0080C0>We had a good time growin' up,
though, man.</font>

225
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,172
<font color=#0080C0>We always had
a lot of dogs at my house</font>

226
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,632
<font color=#0080C0>'cause my grandmother would
always pick up stray dogs.</font>

227
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:40,093
<font color=#0080C0>Which became my attitude
towards men.</font>

228
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,181
<font color=#0080C0>That's right.
I see some guy wandering the street,</font>

229
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,975
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like, "Are you lost, buddy?
Huh?</font>

230
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,977
<font color=#0080C0>"Are you lost?</font>

231
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,647
<font color=#0080C0>"You wanna come home with me?
Huh?</font>

232
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,774
<font color=#0080C0>I have bacon at my house."</font>

233
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,784
<font color=#0080C0>We fed our dogs
rice and beans just like us.</font>

234
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,620
<font color=#0080C0>The dogs would
look at us like,</font>

235
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,497
<font color=#0080C0>"Damn, are we broke, too?
Like, what's goin' on?"</font>

236
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,875
<font color=#0080C0>"What's goin'
on with this situation?"</font>

237
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:14,961
<font color=#0080C0>One thing was great,
we had to be creative.</font>

238
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,880
<font color=#0080C0>Like, me and my sibling,
when we would play games,</font>

239
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,049
<font color=#0080C0>we had to play
broke people games.</font>

240
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,843
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah,
I see some of y'all chuckling.</font>

241
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,803
<font color=#0080C0>You guys know exactly what I'm talkin'
about.</font>

242
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:28,350
<font color=#0080C0>Broke people games are games
that don't require toys or money.</font>

243
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,560
<font color=#0080C0>You just had to be creative.</font>

244
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,895
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
we had this one game we used to play</font>

245
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,647
<font color=#0080C0>called Adventure.</font>

246
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,941
<font color=#0080C0>It was just us...</font>

247
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,317
<font color=#0080C0>walkin' around a tree.</font>

248
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,488
<font color=#0080C0>You had to hold onto the tree</font>

249
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,740
<font color=#0080C0>'cause if your foot touched the floor,
you were out.</font>

250
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,785
<font color=#0080C0>That was the adventure part.</font>

251
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,411
<font color=#0080C0>Played another game
called Paper Ball,</font>

252
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,789
<font color=#0080C0>you crumble up a paper,
you throw it to somebody,</font>

253
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,208
<font color=#0080C0>you gotta keep it in the air,
'cause if it hits the floor, you're out.</font>

254
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,753
<font color=#0080C0>The floor was an integral part
of many...</font>

255
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,589
<font color=#0080C0>broke people games.</font>

256
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,216
<font color=#0080C0>Which is why
The Floor is Lava</font>

257
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,261
<font color=#0080C0>is a historically
broke person game.</font>

258
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,971
<font color=#0080C0>Some of these games
are passed down</font>

259
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,223
<font color=#0080C0>from broke generation
to broke generation.</font>

260
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,183
<font color=#0080C0>The Floor is Lava
is one of those games.</font>

261
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:13,853
<font color=#0080C0>If you played The Floor
is Lava and you had money,</font>

262
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,439
<font color=#0080C0>you were appropriating broke culture
and we don't appreciate that.</font>

263
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,736
<font color=#0080C0>Uh-uh. Go to a theme park,
you got the money.</font>

264
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,114
<font color=#0080C0>Why you gotta take from us?</font>

265
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,532
<font color=#0080C0>We weren't broke forever.</font>

266
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,908
<font color=#0080C0>I feel like
people always panic</font>

267
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,535
<font color=#0080C0>when I say that
we were broke.</font>

268
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,453
<font color=#0080C0>We weren't broke forever,
my parents were Latinos,</font>

269
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,914
<font color=#0080C0>they worked really hard to
get us out of that situation.</font>

270
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,416
<font color=#0080C0>You know,
we went from broke,</font>

271
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,959
<font color=#0080C0>to okay, we doin' aight.</font>

272
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:40,630
<font color=#0080C0>To, oh,
we got some money now.</font>

273
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,465
<font color=#0080C0>Then back down to,
okay, we doin' aight.</font>

274
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,344
<font color=#0080C0>Because when broke people
get money,</font>

275
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,179
<font color=#0080C0>they don't know
what to spend it on.</font>

276
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,764
<font color=#0080C0>You spend it on
your fantasies.</font>

277
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,266
<font color=#0080C0>We got a little bit of money,</font>

278
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,685
<font color=#0080C0>and my dad bought a boat.</font>

279
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,023
<font color=#0080C0>We lived in the South Bronx.</font>

280
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:02,235
<font color=#0080C0>Where shall we sail,
Papa?</font>

281
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,116
<font color=#0080C0>Shall we follow
the pissy smell</font>

282
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,035
<font color=#0080C0>to the Isle of Manhattan?</font>

283
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,205
<font color=#0080C0>Let us away to sail.</font>

284
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,252
<font color=#0080C0>Don't get it twisted, man.</font>

285
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:20,754
<font color=#0080C0>I have nothin'
but respect for my parents.</font>

286
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,047
<font color=#0080C0>I love my parents, man.</font>

287
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,840
<font color=#0080C0>As I get older,
I realize</font>

288
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,718
<font color=#0080C0>nobody teaches you
how to be a parent.</font>

289
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,095
<font color=#0080C0>You gotta figure it out
as you go along.</font>

290
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,097
<font color=#0080C0>The closest thing you get is
when they used to give you,</font>

291
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,059
<font color=#0080C0>like,
an egg to take care of for like a week.</font>

292
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,644
<font color=#0080C0>It's cool.
I mean, not in the schools I went to.</font>

293
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,103
<font color=#0080C0>I went to school in the Bronx,
man,</font>

294
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,855
<font color=#0080C0>we just brought
our actual babies.</font>

295
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:42,984
<font color=#0080C0>I was like--</font>

296
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,824
<font color=#0080C0>Hold on, I don't need your egg,
I brought my son, like--</font>

297
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,120
<font color=#0080C0>Matter of fact,
give me that egg,</font>

298
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,664
<font color=#0080C0>I gotta feed my son,
you made me wake him up.</font>

299
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,385
<font color=#0080C0>After that,
I went to a school that was, like,</font>

300
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,011
<font color=#0080C0>majority white people.</font>

301
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,389
<font color=#0080C0>That's when I learned
that I was dyslexic.</font>

302
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,141
<font color=#0080C0>Uh, not from the teachers,
they just thought I was writing in Spanish.</font>

303
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,355
<font color=#0080C0>They were like, "Don't correct here,
it's her culture."</font>

304
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,278
<font color=#0080C0>Oh. I was so racially frustrated growing up.</font>

305
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,241
<font color=#0080C0>Because I'm Latina
but I'm light "skinneded."</font>

306
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,247
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah, so I always felt I had to prove
my ethnicity to people constantly.</font>

307
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,040
<font color=#0080C0>And I would do it
in stupid ways,</font>

308
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,627
<font color=#0080C0>like throwing random
Spanish words into sentences.</font>

309
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,213
<font color=#0080C0>I'd be like, "Okay, guys,
see you at escuela."</font>

310
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,301
<font color=#0080C0>Like some sort of
live action Dora.</font>

311
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,060
<font color=#0080C0>I just wanted to be
identifiably ethnic.</font>

312
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:00,687
<font color=#0080C0>Like, I wanted to be darker.</font>

313
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,105
<font color=#0080C0>I wanted darker skin
and a white boyfriend,</font>

314
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,899
<font color=#0080C0>those were my only two goals.</font>

315
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,484
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause that's my parents'
dynamic.</font>

316
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:07,652
<font color=#0080C0>Both of my parents
are Puerto Rican,</font>

317
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,070
<font color=#0080C0>but my dad is light skinned,</font>

318
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,281
<font color=#0080C0>and my mom has beautiful
dark olive skin.</font>

319
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,782
<font color=#0080C0>And I would watch her
put on her make up,</font>

320
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,534
<font color=#0080C0>and she would wear
purple eye shadow</font>

321
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:17,120
<font color=#0080C0>and vibrant blushes and
I thought she looked beautiful,</font>

322
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,290
<font color=#0080C0>and then she would put
that same make up on me.</font>

323
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:23,918
<font color=#0080C0>And I looked like
a damn clown.</font>

324
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,380
<font color=#0080C0>And because of my light skin,
people always tell me</font>

325
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:28,923
<font color=#0080C0>I look like my dad,
they be like,</font>

326
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,425
<font color=#0080C0>"Oh,
you look just like your father."</font>

327
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,635
<font color=#0080C0>I'd be like, "Great.
He's a man."</font>

328
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,349
<font color=#0080C0>I want to look like my mom,
she's a woman.</font>

329
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,893
<font color=#0080C0>Always felt so terrible
as a kid</font>

330
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,728
<font color=#0080C0>'cause I thought
I look like a guy,</font>

331
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,313
<font color=#0080C0>and now my voice is deep,
so I always thought</font>

332
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,939
<font color=#0080C0>I sounded like a dude, too.</font>

333
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,399
<font color=#0080C0>And plus, I'm Puerto Rican,</font>

334
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,610
<font color=#0080C0>but I speak Spanish with
a Mexican accent.</font>

335
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,572
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah, I know.</font>

336
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,949
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause my friends are Mexican,
I went to a Mexican church,</font>

337
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,243
<font color=#0080C0>I love tacos,
that was another reason.</font>

338
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,622
<font color=#0080C0>Girl, yes.</font>

339
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,832
<font color=#0080C0>I'm learning French now,</font>

340
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,335
<font color=#0080C0>my biggest fear is I'm gonna speak
French with a Mexican accent.</font>

341
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:11,049
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause that's the accent I'm most
comfortable and confident in.</font>

342
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,675
<font color=#0080C0>But that's gonna be ridiculous
if I'm like,</font>

343
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:22,143
<font color=#0080C0>Everybody's
gonna be like,</font>

344
00:18:22,227 --> 00:18:24,270
<font color=#0080C0>"That poor French
Puerto Rican Mexican girl."</font>

345
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,066
<font color=#0080C0>She is confused.</font>

346
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,862
<font color=#0080C0>And the wrong accent
can mess up the mood.</font>

347
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,405
<font color=#0080C0>All right, like,
I downloaded a meditation</font>

348
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,074
<font color=#0080C0>to help with anxiety,</font>

349
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,159
<font color=#0080C0>and they guy doing
the guided meditation</font>

350
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:42,455
<font color=#0080C0>had a Cockney British accent.</font>

351
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,916
<font color=#0080C0>I don't know
if you've heard this,</font>

352
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,377
<font color=#0080C0>but it is not comforting.</font>

353
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,503
<font color=#0080C0>Like, I hit play,
and he was like,</font>

354
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,047
<font color=#0080C0>"'ello!</font>

355
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,882
<font color=#0080C0>"My name's Nigel.</font>

356
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,926
<font color=#0080C0>"I'm 'ere to 'elp you
with your anxiety.</font>

357
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,429
<font color=#0080C0>All right, close your eyes."</font>

358
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,306
<font color=#0080C0>I will do no such thing,
Nigel.</font>

359
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,853
<font color=#0080C0>I don't feel safe.</font>

360
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,607
<font color=#0080C0>We're gonna
give thanks for everything.</font>

361
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,485
<font color=#0080C0>I'm always jealous of
people with, like, awesome accents,</font>

362
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:15,113
<font color=#0080C0>Or tattoos.
I saw this guy with a compass tattoo,</font>

363
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,990
<font color=#0080C0>and in the middle of
the tattoo it said,</font>

364
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,325
<font color=#0080C0>"You are here."</font>

365
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:24,330
<font color=#0080C0>I was intrigued.</font>

366
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,708
<font color=#0080C0>I was like, "Hey,
what does your tattoo mean?"</font>

367
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,420
<font color=#0080C0>And he was like,
"Oh, this?</font>

368
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,548
<font color=#0080C0>This is for, like,
when I feel lost."</font>

369
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,431
<font color=#0080C0>"I just look down,</font>

370
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,310
<font color=#0080C0>and I'm like, nah, bro.
You're right here."</font>

371
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,447
<font color=#0080C0>Probably the best tattoo story
I've ever heard.</font>

372
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,449
<font color=#0080C0>He asked me if I had tattoos,
I was like,</font>

373
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,911
<font color=#0080C0>"Oh, I have stretch marks
which are nature's tattoos."</font>

374
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,539
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah,
they signify that I like bread,</font>

375
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,249
<font color=#0080C0>that's what my tattoos mean.</font>

376
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,084
<font color=#0080C0>This one's red velvet,</font>

377
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,086
<font color=#0080C0>I got a couple of everything
bagels right over here.</font>

378
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,176
<font color=#0080C0>Ain't no shame in my game,
I love food,</font>

379
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,886
<font color=#0080C0>I'm not even gonna pretend
like I don't.</font>

380
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,763
<font color=#0080C0>I love food too much.</font>

381
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,681
<font color=#0080C0>Too much.
I walked into a store the other day,</font>

382
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,308
<font color=#0080C0>I saw my favorite pack
of Gummy Bears</font>

383
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,518
<font color=#0080C0>and I gasped like I saw
a celebrity.</font>

384
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,440
<font color=#0080C0>That's too excited
for Gummy Bears.</font>

385
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:35,360
<font color=#0080C0>Oh, I try.
Sometimes I see like a super skinny person,</font>

386
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,612
<font color=#0080C0>and I be like, "Hey, you look great.
What do you eat?"</font>

387
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,949
<font color=#0080C0>And there's always some
depressing list of things.</font>

388
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,618
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
"I eat lettuce and asparagus</font>

389
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,453
<font color=#0080C0>and sometimes I eat an onion."</font>

390
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:50,833
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like, "Oh,
so there's no hope is what you're saying?</font>

391
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,795
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I'm not doing
any of that."</font>

392
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:56,464
<font color=#0080C0>I always hope they have, like,
some secret that I've never heard of.</font>

393
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,508
<font color=#0080C0>Like, they're gonna be like, "Did you know
that if you eat a doughnut standing up,</font>

394
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,968
<font color=#0080C0>it's like half the calories?"</font>

395
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,471
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you, you skinny angel.</font>

396
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,559
<font color=#0080C0>I try, man.
I'm trying to be vegan now.</font>

397
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,895
<font color=#0080C0>I'm succeeding on Instagram.
Uh--</font>

398
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,528
<font color=#0080C0>Killin' it on the 'gram.</font>

399
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,198
<font color=#0080C0>Took a picture of
a vegan brownie that I bought</font>

400
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,450
<font color=#0080C0>and I posted it,
and somebody commented,</font>

401
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,162
<font color=#0080C0>"Why do vegans always have to
brag about being vegan?"</font>

402
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,540
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
"That brownie was $10."</font>

403
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:36,421
<font color=#0080C0>I'ma tell everybody
about that brownie.</font>

404
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,881
<font color=#0080C0>I didn't eat it, I just been showin'
it to people that come over.</font>

405
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:42,719
<font color=#0080C0>Like, hey, look,
this is what a $10 brownie looks like.</font>

406
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,263
<font color=#0080C0>Look at that.</font>

407
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,347
<font color=#0080C0>Don't touch it.
Look at that.</font>

408
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,271
<font color=#0080C0>Get your non vegan fingers
away from here.</font>

409
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,775
<font color=#0080C0>I'ma make it into a necklace,
wear it at weddings.</font>

410
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,528
<font color=#0080C0>You can recycle vegan food
like that.</font>

411
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,655
<font color=#0080C0>It's hard, man.
It's hard being vegan.</font>

412
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:05,742
<font color=#0080C0>It's not just no meat,
it's no milk, no eggs, no honey.</font>

413
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,286
<font color=#0080C0>I did find out, though,
you can eat honey and still be vegan,</font>

414
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:09,954
<font color=#0080C0>as long as nobody sees you.</font>

415
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,253
<font color=#0080C0>Just eat honey in the shadows,
ain't nobody gonna care.</font>

416
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,965
<font color=#0080C0>So far,
the vegan mafia has not caught on.</font>

417
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,926
<font color=#0080C0>I really wish they would-- Oh,
I would love to meet the vegan mafia.</font>

418
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:25,553
<font color=#0080C0>They'd show up at my doorstep,</font>

419
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,430
<font color=#0080C0>like, "Hey,
I'm Tommy No Cheese."</font>

420
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,728
<font color=#0080C0>"This is Coconut Milk Larry.</font>

421
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,563
<font color=#0080C0>"And Agave Dave.</font>

422
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,148
<font color=#0080C0>"We heard you been eatin'
honey,</font>

423
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,566
<font color=#0080C0>we gotta have
a word with you out back."</font>

424
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,361
<font color=#0080C0>My friends don't even trust
going out with me anymore.</font>

425
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,072
<font color=#0080C0>They won't eat out with me
anymore</font>

426
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:46,032
<font color=#0080C0>'cause every time they go,
now they do a check,</font>

427
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,576
<font color=#0080C0>they're like,
"Is there gonna be real food there?"</font>

428
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:52,371
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like, "As in those sawdust
burritos we had last time?</font>

429
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:54,707
<font color=#0080C0>I thought those were
delicious."</font>

430
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,459
<font color=#0080C0>The hardest was
telling my family</font>

431
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,836
<font color=#0080C0>that I wasn't eating meat
over the holidays.</font>

432
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,297
<font color=#0080C0>Trying to tell your
Latino family</font>

433
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,591
<font color=#0080C0>that you don't eat meat,</font>

434
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,259
<font color=#0080C0>they don't get it.</font>

435
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,095
<font color=#0080C0>My mom was like,
"Even chicken?"</font>

436
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,100
<font color=#0080C0>"Even steak?"</font>

437
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,352
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
"You know what?</font>

438
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,562
<font color=#0080C0>"I'm gonna snort some quinoa and
just call it a night, Ma, like--</font>

439
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,566
<font color=#0080C0>"You ain't gotta work
this hard."</font>

440
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,235
<font color=#0080C0>My mom works so hard on the holidays,
too,</font>

441
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,362
<font color=#0080C0>she always start cooking
the night before.</font>

442
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,114
<font color=#0080C0>My husband gets all excited.</font>

443
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,282
<font color=#0080C0>He's always like,
"Damn, your mom can cook."</font>

444
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:31,119
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like, "Well,
it don't run in the family, so relax."</font>

445
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,333
<font color=#0080C0>He, like, gets all excited.</font>

446
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,962
<font color=#0080C0>There will be none of that.</font>

447
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,755
<font color=#0080C0>You know,
we do a prayer in my family</font>

448
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:44,298
<font color=#0080C0>before we do the dinner thing,</font>

449
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,175
<font color=#0080C0>and I know it's not
everybody's thing,</font>

450
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,302
<font color=#0080C0>but we're Latinos,
so we're like this with Jesus, so--</font>

451
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,390
<font color=#0080C0>We gotta throw him
a little shout out.</font>

452
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:54,767
<font color=#0080C0>But you gotta be careful
who you let do the prayer,</font>

453
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,146
<font color=#0080C0>'cause there's always that one
passive aggressive family member</font>

454
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,898
<font color=#0080C0>that's waiting to shout out
somebody's business--</font>

455
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,067
<font color=#0080C0>In the prayer.</font>

456
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:05,486
<font color=#0080C0>Like, "Dear Lord,
we're thankful for everybody bein' here,</font>

457
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,573
<font color=#0080C0>especially Gina who never seems
to have time for anybody anymore."</font>

458
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,910
<font color=#0080C0>"We're really happy that her husband's here,
too,</font>

459
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,579
<font color=#0080C0>'cause it's about damn time
she got married,</font>

460
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,956
<font color=#0080C0>know what I'm sayin'"?</font>

461
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,000
<font color=#0080C0>"Hopefully,
this one doesn't have a prison record.</font>

462
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,586
<font color=#0080C0>"Anyway,
I'm sure you will heal her</font>

463
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,171
<font color=#0080C0>in the way she needs to be healed,
Lord."</font>

464
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,508
<font color=#0080C0>It's all the same, like,
everybody falls into their little roles</font>

465
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:29,343
<font color=#0080C0>when they come back,
you know what I mean?</font>

466
00:24:29,427 --> 00:24:31,470
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
the same fights that happened the year before</font>

467
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,139
<font color=#0080C0>are gonna happen again
that next year,</font>

468
00:24:33,222 --> 00:24:36,017
<font color=#0080C0>and you're kind of
looking forward to it.</font>

469
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,476
<font color=#0080C0>Soon as those people walk in,
you're like,</font>

470
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,936
<font color=#0080C0>round two.</font>

471
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,522
<font color=#0080C0>Finish it.</font>

472
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:47,320
<font color=#0080C0>Everybody does their own little thing,
you know?</font>

473
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:50,990
<font color=#0080C0>My mom still watches all of her telenovelas,
right?</font>

474
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:55,828
<font color=#0080C0>Growing up, my mom had a VCR in
every single room of the house</font>

475
00:24:55,912 --> 00:24:58,414
<font color=#0080C0>so she could record all of her
favorite telenovelas.</font>

476
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,082
<font color=#0080C0>And for those of you
that don't know,</font>

477
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,168
<font color=#0080C0>a telenovela's like
a soap opera</font>

478
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,212
<font color=#0080C0>but with more evil twins.</font>

479
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,091
<font color=#0080C0>And more people dying,
but turning out to not be dead.</font>

480
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,262
<font color=#0080C0>It's so amazing
'cause when somebody dies,</font>

481
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:16,349
<font color=#0080C0>they still get upset, like,
"I know they killed Ruby."</font>

482
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,600
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like,
the show is called "Ruby,"</font>

483
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,893
<font color=#0080C0>I think she gonna come back.</font>

484
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,356
<font color=#0080C0>Pretty sure.</font>

485
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:25,775
<font color=#0080C0>She's gonna be aight.</font>

486
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,902
<font color=#0080C0>I grew up watching both
Latino television</font>

487
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,195
<font color=#0080C0>and American television,</font>

488
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:30,696
<font color=#0080C0>and I noticed
the similarities.</font>

489
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,365
<font color=#0080C0>A lot of the programs
were similar,</font>

490
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,785
<font color=#0080C0>it's just that Latinos,
we always gotta be extra.</font>

491
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,038
<font color=#0080C0>We always gotta be extra.
It's like, we looked at regular soap operas,</font>

492
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,040
<font color=#0080C0>and we're like, you call that drama?
That's cute.</font>

493
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:46,879
<font color=#0080C0>I'll show you drama.</font>

494
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,591
<font color=#0080C0>Right?
Everything's extra about what we do.</font>

495
00:25:50,675 --> 00:25:52,843
<font color=#0080C0>Like, on American television,
they got "Kelly and Ryan,"</font>

496
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:54,679
<font color=#0080C0>we got
"El Gordo y La Flaca."</font>

497
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,685
<font color=#0080C0>That's right.</font>

498
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:05,523
<font color=#0080C0>Which translates to
"The Fat Man and the Skinny Woman."</font>

499
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,358
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause who cares
what their names are.</font>

500
00:26:09,277 --> 00:26:11,445
<font color=#0080C0>It's like "Kelly and Ryan," but extra.
Y'all know.</font>

501
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,447
<font color=#0080C0>We all know if "Kelly and Ryan"
was translated,</font>

502
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:14,740
<font color=#0080C0>it would be "Las Flacas."</font>

503
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:22,331
<font color=#0080C0>I know some of y'all want to
correct my Spanish right now,</font>

504
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:25,209
<font color=#0080C0>but I said what I said.</font>

505
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,253
<font color=#0080C0>I'm just kidding,
I'm just kidding.</font>

506
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,090
<font color=#0080C0>I love seeing my family,
I'm closest with my sister,</font>

507
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:33,301
<font color=#0080C0>I have an identical
twin sister,</font>

508
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,636
<font color=#0080C0>and, uh, I always tell people,
hey, if you don't like the show,</font>

509
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,222
<font color=#0080C0>please make sure you harass
the right person online.</font>

510
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,685
<font color=#0080C0>We get confused for each other
all the time.</font>

511
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,354
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
one time I spent 20 minutes getting yelled at</font>

512
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,858
<font color=#0080C0>by a guy that
my sister ghosted.</font>

513
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,776
<font color=#0080C0>I couldn't even blame him,
man,</font>

514
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,361
<font color=#0080C0>it must have felt like he was
getting ghosted again,</font>

515
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:53,529
<font color=#0080C0>but in real life.</font>

516
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:59,243
<font color=#0080C0>Sir, I've never been to dinner
and a movie with you.</font>

517
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,708
<font color=#0080C0>As a matter of fact,
I've been dead for four years.</font>

518
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,338
<font color=#0080C0>I'm close to my brother, too.</font>

519
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,797
<font color=#0080C0>My brother is openly gay,</font>

520
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:14,216
<font color=#0080C0>he came out to me
when I was 14 years old.</font>

521
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,969
<font color=#0080C0>I don't know how old he was because
gay men don't tell you their age.</font>

522
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,099
<font color=#0080C0>I lived with my brother
for three years,</font>

523
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,268
<font color=#0080C0>and I had nowhere to go, he took me in,
he let me live with him.</font>

524
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,938
<font color=#0080C0>I lived in his living room
on a twin size bed.</font>

525
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,316
<font color=#0080C0>And he had three cats.</font>

526
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,110
<font color=#0080C0>And I have two ferrets.</font>

527
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:36,864
<font color=#0080C0>It was like
a little urban zoo.</font>

528
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,824
<font color=#0080C0>And those were
my single years,</font>

529
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:42,370
<font color=#0080C0>so imagine bringing a guy home
to that super sexy scenario.</font>

530
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,331
<font color=#0080C0>Every time
I brought a guy home,</font>

531
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:46,749
<font color=#0080C0>I felt like a shameful
little Hobbit.</font>

532
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:49,001
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
please don't mind the smell.</font>

533
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,426
<font color=#0080C0>Or the twin size bed.</font>

534
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:01,430
<font color=#0080C0>Also,
my brother's in the next room.</font>

535
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:08,729
<font color=#0080C0>It's hard enough having your
dates judged by your brother,</font>

536
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,398
<font color=#0080C0>but he's not just judging them
as my brother,</font>

537
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,024
<font color=#0080C0>he's judging them
as a gay man,</font>

538
00:28:12,108 --> 00:28:14,610
<font color=#0080C0>so he'd be like,
that guy's not even cute.</font>

539
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,156
<font color=#0080C0>I was like, well,
first of all, I'm desperate.</font>

540
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,742
<font color=#0080C0>'kay?</font>

541
00:28:21,826 --> 00:28:24,203
<font color=#0080C0>Second of all,
see first of all.</font>

542
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,457
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause those were the
internet dating years for me,</font>

543
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,167
<font color=#0080C0>and dating has changed
so much.</font>

544
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,502
<font color=#0080C0>It used to be about
finding a relationship,</font>

545
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,462
<font color=#0080C0>finding something.</font>

546
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:37,550
<font color=#0080C0>Now it's about who's closest
and can get naked the fastest.</font>

547
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:39,969
<font color=#0080C0>It's like you're just
Amazoning people to your house.</font>

548
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,806
<font color=#0080C0>I was on all of the apps,
too,</font>

549
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,349
<font color=#0080C0>I was on Tinder,
I was on Bumble,</font>

550
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,977
<font color=#0080C0>I was on JSwipe,
that's the Jewish one.</font>

551
00:28:52,815 --> 00:28:55,568
<font color=#0080C0>I thought it was for if you
wanted to date a Jewish guy.</font>

552
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:58,696
<font color=#0080C0>Apparently,
it's also so they can date Jewish women.</font>

553
00:28:58,779 --> 00:28:59,864
<font color=#0080C0>Whoops!</font>

554
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,576
<font color=#0080C0>I got duped by a lot of
those dating apps</font>

555
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:07,413
<font color=#0080C0>because someone taught guys
about high angles and filters,</font>

556
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,665
<font color=#0080C0>and now they're using our tricks against us,
ladies.</font>

557
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,294
<font color=#0080C0>How's that gonna work, man?</font>

558
00:29:13,377 --> 00:29:14,962
<font color=#0080C0>I don't look like how
I'm supposed to look,</font>

559
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,631
<font color=#0080C0>you don't look like how
you're supposed to look.</font>

560
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:19,675
<font color=#0080C0>How are we gonna find each
other at this restaurant?</font>

561
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:31,687
<font color=#0080C0>Now we're just both sittin'
here</font>

562
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,689
<font color=#0080C0>thinkin' we got stood up.</font>

563
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:38,819
<font color=#0080C0>Lookin'
for someone that don't exist.</font>

564
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:41,030
<font color=#0080C0>Those were weird times,
man.</font>

565
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,907
<font color=#0080C0>A lot of girls
would use filters that had,</font>

566
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,326
<font color=#0080C0>like,
the animal filters from Snapchat.</font>

567
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,827
<font color=#0080C0>On their, like, profiles,
they'd have, like,</font>

568
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,747
<font color=#0080C0>bunny rabbit ears or
a little kitty cat nose.</font>

569
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,375
<font color=#0080C0>I never did that
'cause I didn't want no freak showin' up.</font>

570
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,085
<font color=#0080C0>Right?
Some guy shows up, like,</font>

571
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,962
<font color=#0080C0>"Hey, did you bring them ears,
though?"</font>

572
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,343
<font color=#0080C0>"I'm sayin',
you look mad good as a rabbit."</font>

573
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,435
<font color=#0080C0>That's all the dating apps were,
man,</font>

574
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,896
<font color=#0080C0>dodging different levels
of freaks.</font>

575
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,775
<font color=#0080C0>I met a lot of guys that were
into being dominated by women.</font>

576
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:19,276
<font color=#0080C0>Girl, no.</font>

577
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,952
<font color=#0080C0>Those men are impossible
to get rid of.</font>

578
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,287
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause you can't tell 'em to get lost,
they're into it.</font>

579
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,583
<font color=#0080C0>Can't be like,
"Get the hell away from me!"</font>

580
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,919
<font color=#0080C0>"Yes, mistress."
No!</font>

581
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,966
<font color=#0080C0>They're like the cockroaches
of the dating world,</font>

582
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:43,842
<font color=#0080C0>you can't get rid of 'em.</font>

583
00:30:43,926 --> 00:30:45,302
<font color=#0080C0>You just gotta
make 'em useful,</font>

584
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,471
<font color=#0080C0>be like,
"Go get my dry cleaning, loser."</font>

585
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:48,847
<font color=#0080C0>He's like,
"Yes, mistress."</font>

586
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:49,890
<font color=#0080C0>Exactly.</font>

587
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,644
<font color=#0080C0>I remember there was one guy
I was dating for a little bit,</font>

588
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,688
<font color=#0080C0>he wanted me to stay over,
like spend the night,</font>

589
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:58,107
<font color=#0080C0>but he had
a sleep apnea machine,</font>

590
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,609
<font color=#0080C0>and I was like--</font>

591
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,950
<font color=#0080C0>How are you gonna make a move?</font>

592
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:14,123
<font color=#0080C0>You cannot Darth Vader your way
into my pants.</font>

593
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,541
<font color=#0080C0>I can't, like--</font>

594
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,128
<font color=#0080C0>"I will be your baby father."</font>

595
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,092
<font color=#0080C0>No, you won't, booboo,
no you won't.</font>

596
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:27,511
<font color=#0080C0>Thank God I met my husband.</font>

597
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,639
<font color=#0080C0>I met my husband at a time
in my singlehood</font>

598
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:33,350
<font color=#0080C0>where I was fully ready
to be a 'ho.</font>

599
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:37,438
<font color=#0080C0>Let me explain.
Let me explain.</font>

600
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,029
<font color=#0080C0>Every woman reaches that point
in her singlehood</font>

601
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:48,282
<font color=#0080C0>where she gives up on
the pursuit for a relationship</font>

602
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,826
<font color=#0080C0>and she waves the white flag
of 'ho-ness.</font>

603
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:56,081
<font color=#0080C0>And she's like, I can't,
I can't do this no more.</font>

604
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,833
<font color=#0080C0>And I was getting ready to
work on a cruise ship.</font>

605
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,085
<font color=#0080C0>I met my husband
on a cruise ship,</font>

606
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,046
<font color=#0080C0>so he's 90.</font>

607
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,842
<font color=#0080C0>I'm tryin' to get that paper.
I'm kidding.</font>

608
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,304
<font color=#0080C0>I was getting ready to do
comedy on this cruise ship,</font>

609
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:12,640
<font color=#0080C0>and I got on that ship
with 'ho in my heart.</font>

610
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,353
<font color=#0080C0>And then the first day
on that ship,</font>

611
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,730
<font color=#0080C0>I-- I just see the most handsome
man I've ever seen in my life,</font>

612
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,482
<font color=#0080C0>and I had a crush on him
instantly.</font>

613
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:25,110
<font color=#0080C0>And I was, like, no!</font>

614
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:27,655
<font color=#0080C0>I was supposed to be a 'ho.</font>

615
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,412
<font color=#0080C0>I was 'ho blocked.</font>

616
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,001
<font color=#0080C0>So I stalked him.</font>

617
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,629
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause that's what you do
when you like a guy.</font>

618
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:46,674
<font color=#0080C0>Every woman in here knows
she's part FBI agent.</font>

619
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:50,969
<font color=#0080C0>That's right.</font>

620
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,974
<font color=#0080C0>Soon as I had his full name,</font>

621
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,519
<font color=#0080C0>I launched
a cyber investigation.</font>

622
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,942
<font color=#0080C0>Do you know how hard it was
when I met his family</font>

623
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:08,070
<font color=#0080C0>to pretend like I didn't know
everything about them already?</font>

624
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,868
<font color=#0080C0>I was so afraid that
I was gonna say someone's name</font>

625
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:17,705
<font color=#0080C0>before they
introduced themselves.</font>

626
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:19,540
<font color=#0080C0>Like, "Hey, Miriam,
how you doin', girl?</font>

627
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,166
<font color=#0080C0>I mean, hey, girl,
what's your name?"</font>

628
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,753
<font color=#0080C0>"How are the renovations on
the house goin-- "</font>

629
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,297
<font color=#0080C0>Damn!
I wasn't supposed to know that.</font>

630
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,301
<font color=#0080C0>Man, we do creepy stuff.
Women can be creepy.</font>

631
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,095
<font color=#0080C0>Nobody ever looks at our stuff as creepy,
though,</font>

632
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,055
<font color=#0080C0>everything seems adorable
when we do it.</font>

633
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,724
<font color=#0080C0>Guys be like,
"Oh, look at her,</font>

634
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,809
<font color=#0080C0>she's so cute in my bushes.
Hey, girl, hey."</font>

635
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,814
<font color=#0080C0>"She works so hard to
keep up with my schedule."</font>

636
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,903
<font color=#0080C0>Man, I know I'm creepy.</font>

637
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,405
<font color=#0080C0>I watch my husband sleep.</font>

638
00:33:54,324 --> 00:33:56,452
<font color=#0080C0>You know how I know
that's creepy?</font>

639
00:33:56,535 --> 00:34:00,831
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause if I ever woke up
and he was watching me sleep,</font>

640
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,333
<font color=#0080C0>I'd be like,
he is 100 percent gonna murder me,</font>

641
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,127
<font color=#0080C0>like,
that's what's gonna happen.</font>

642
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,464
<font color=#0080C0>I would not think
that was cute.</font>

643
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,549
<font color=#0080C0>We do creepy stuff.
Women do creepy stuff, man.</font>

644
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,843
<font color=#0080C0>We'll go through your
medicine cabinet.</font>

645
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,261
<font color=#0080C0>You leave us alone
in your room,</font>

646
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,263
<font color=#0080C0>we're goin'
through that drawer.</font>

647
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,099
<font color=#0080C0>We're lookin' for clues,
tryin' to figure out who you are.</font>

648
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,768
<font color=#0080C0>Men will go through drawers,
too,</font>

649
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:21,977
<font color=#0080C0>but they go right for
the underwear drawer.</font>

650
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:24,688
<font color=#0080C0>They are not lookin'
for clues.</font>

651
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,106
<font color=#0080C0>They will look past
a human foot</font>

652
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,400
<font color=#0080C0>to see what kind of
drawers you got in there.</font>

653
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,986
<font color=#0080C0>Like, "Is that a thong?
This girl's a freak."</font>

654
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,702
<font color=#0080C0>Sometimes guys will sniff
a girl's clothing.</font>

655
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:40,621
<font color=#0080C0>Women don't do that,
that's a creepy thing women don't do.</font>

656
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,790
<font color=#0080C0>We don't do that.</font>

657
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:45,417
<font color=#0080C0>The only time we sniff your
clothing is if there's a problem.</font>

658
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:48,212
<font color=#0080C0>Like, we'll be like, "Oh,
you gotta wash that, bro, like that's nasty.</font>

659
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,590
<font color=#0080C0>Like, I'm just tryin' to help you out,
that's gross."</font>

660
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,845
<font color=#0080C0>If a girl likes you enough and
she goes through your drawers,</font>

661
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,807
<font color=#0080C0>if she finds something suspect,
she'll make excuses.</font>

662
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,726
<font color=#0080C0>If she likes you enough,
she'll find your antipsychotic meds,</font>

663
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,561
<font color=#0080C0>and be like,
"At least he's trying to get help."</font>

664
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,692
<font color=#0080C0>"He's just tryin'
to help himself."</font>

665
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,779
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause men will see red flags,
and they'll be, like,</font>

666
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,447
<font color=#0080C0>"I'm out."</font>

667
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:16,949
<font color=#0080C0>A woman will see red flags
and she's like,</font>

668
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,534
<font color=#0080C0>"Ooh! A project."</font>

669
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,623
<font color=#0080C0>"He don't need these pills,
he just need a hug."</font>

670
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,503
<font color=#0080C0>"I'ma give him all the hugs
his crazy self needs."</font>

671
00:35:32,422 --> 00:35:35,342
<font color=#0080C0>So I did,
I stalked my husband.</font>

672
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,593
<font color=#0080C0>Aight?</font>

673
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:38,220
<font color=#0080C0>I had found out his schedule,</font>

674
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:40,222
<font color=#0080C0>I would try to show up lookin'
all fly.</font>

675
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,849
<font color=#0080C0>All right,
one time I looked real cute,</font>

676
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:43,517
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
"He's totally gonna flirt with me.</font>

677
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,061
<font color=#0080C0>I look adorable."</font>

678
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,188
<font color=#0080C0>He didn't, so...</font>

679
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,857
<font color=#0080C0>But then one night after a show,
he came up to me</font>

680
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:52,234
<font color=#0080C0>and he was like,
"I just got to see you perform.</font>

681
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,695
<font color=#0080C0>"I think you're so talented,
I think you're so funny, and you're--</font>

682
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,905
<font color=#0080C0>you're the most beautiful
female comedian I've ever seen."</font>

683
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,158
<font color=#0080C0>And I went, "That's very specific,
but thank you."</font>

684
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,537
<font color=#0080C0>Could have just said
beautiful,</font>

685
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,663
<font color=#0080C0>I would have been
fine with it.</font>

686
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,003
<font color=#0080C0>And then we talked,
we talked for hours,</font>

687
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,880
<font color=#0080C0>and then we went back to his cabin,
and I was like--</font>

688
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,091
<font color=#0080C0>I'ma get my 'ho-ment.</font>

689
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,972
<font color=#0080C0>That's a 'ho moment,
y'all can take that home with you.</font>

690
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:26,226
<font color=#0080C0>And then we got married.</font>

691
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,854
<font color=#0080C0>We did, we did it,
we made it happen.</font>

692
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:32,482
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah. Yeah.</font>

693
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:36,069
<font color=#0080C0>It can happen for you, too.</font>

694
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:37,988
<font color=#0080C0>You just gotta
want to be a 'ho.</font>

695
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,492
<font color=#0080C0>That's it.
Just own it.</font>

696
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:44,494
<font color=#0080C0>I was nervous,
I was nervous to get married</font>

697
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,788
<font color=#0080C0>because my husband wanted us to
write our own wedding vows,</font>

698
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,041
<font color=#0080C0>which, like, you know--</font>

699
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,294
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause he has feelings.</font>

700
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,463
<font color=#0080C0>I don't know how to
express myself.</font>

701
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,673
<font color=#0080C0>I was so nervous
my wedding vows were gonna be</font>

702
00:36:56,757 --> 00:36:58,008
<font color=#0080C0>the most New York
gangster vows.</font>

703
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,678
<font color=#0080C0>I was so afraid I was gonna
get up there and be like,</font>

704
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,221
<font color=#0080C0>"Yo, I dead ass love you,
son."</font>

705
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,058
<font color=#0080C0>Yo.</font>

706
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,480
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah.</font>

707
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,734
<font color=#0080C0>"On God,
I love you my guy."</font>

708
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,155
<font color=#0080C0>Then we'd just chest bump.</font>

709
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,325
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like,
"Let's do this!"</font>

710
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:25,661
<font color=#0080C0>The priest is like,
"You may now dap the bride."</font>

711
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,412
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like, "Thanks."</font>

712
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:38,382
<font color=#0080C0>Me and the bridal party gotta jump
him into the marriage after that.</font>

713
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,800
<font color=#0080C0>Couple gangsters,
couple gangsters.</font>

714
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,303
<font color=#0080C0>Now that I'm married,
I'm constantly on guard</font>

715
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:45,430
<font color=#0080C0>'cause I'm a jealous woman.</font>

716
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,807
<font color=#0080C0>Not gonna lie,
it's the biggest issue he has to deal with.</font>

717
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,684
<font color=#0080C0>I'm jealous, man.</font>

718
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,435
<font color=#0080C0>You would think it would
chill out when I got married.</font>

719
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:53,063
<font color=#0080C0>Uh-uh. If you talk to my
husband a second too long,</font>

720
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:55,065
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like-- Ahhh.</font>

721
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,486
<font color=#0080C0>I don't know
what your game is</font>

722
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,321
<font color=#0080C0>with this flirty line of
questioning,</font>

723
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:02,906
<font color=#0080C0>but I don't like it.</font>

724
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,533
<font color=#0080C0>I'll be taking over
from now on,</font>

725
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,702
<font color=#0080C0>and yes, he will have fries.</font>

726
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,412
<font color=#0080C0>I see you.</font>

727
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:11,373
<font color=#0080C0>Oh, I see you,
I see you.</font>

728
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,499
<font color=#0080C0>I see you.</font>

729
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,545
<font color=#0080C0>People get intrusive
with their questions,</font>

730
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:18,714
<font color=#0080C0>they be like, "Oh, my gosh,
how tall is your husband?"</font>

731
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,881
<font color=#0080C0>Husband height.</font>

732
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,469
<font color=#0080C0>What cologne does he wear?
Scent of my husband.</font>

733
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:27,973
<font color=#0080C0>His favorite movie's
our wedding video.</font>

734
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,349
<font color=#0080C0>You can leave now.</font>

735
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,358
<font color=#0080C0>They don't tell you this,
but when you get married to somebody,</font>

736
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:42,487
<font color=#0080C0>you marry the entire
bibliography of their issues.</font>

737
00:38:42,571 --> 00:38:45,657
<font color=#0080C0>And you marry their family
who gave them those issues.</font>

738
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:49,911
<font color=#0080C0>Like, his mom never made him
clean up his clothes as a kid.</font>

739
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,538
<font color=#0080C0>Guess who's problem
that is now?</font>

740
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:57,377
<font color=#0080C0>My husband will leave little
piles of clothing on the floor</font>

741
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,838
<font color=#0080C0>as if he was raptured
out of our apartment.</font>

742
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:09,848
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like,
"Were you never beaten as a child for this?"</font>

743
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,902
<font color=#0080C0>We were clearly
raised differently.</font>

744
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:27,199
<font color=#0080C0>I know this one time, he had an
argument with his mom in front of me,</font>

745
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,910
<font color=#0080C0>and I was shocked 'cause
I didn't realize</font>

746
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,829
<font color=#0080C0>you could argue with
your parents.</font>

747
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,623
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
Latinos live in fear of our parents</font>

748
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,416
<font color=#0080C0>well into our early 100s.</font>

749
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,087
<font color=#0080C0>Right, like--</font>

750
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:45,175
<font color=#0080C0>I ain't tryin' to argue.</font>

751
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,052
<font color=#0080C0>I love life.</font>

752
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,388
<font color=#0080C0>He saw how shocked I was,
he was like,</font>

753
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:52,099
<font color=#0080C0>"Don't worry,
I would never talk to you like that,"</font>

754
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,101
<font color=#0080C0>and I was like,
"I don't suggest it."</font>

755
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,066
<font color=#0080C0>You're a sound sleeper.</font>

756
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:05,695
<font color=#0080C0>Why do I know this?</font>

757
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,908
<font color=#0080C0>When you get married,
you gotta get used to</font>

758
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:12,494
<font color=#0080C0>somebody being in your space
all the time.</font>

759
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:15,664
<font color=#0080C0>Like, when I was single,
I woke up alone a lot.</font>

760
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,709
<font color=#0080C0>Now, every time I wake up,
I'm like-- Ahh!</font>

761
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:23,839
<font color=#0080C0>Oh, it's you.</font>

762
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,007
<font color=#0080C0>It's like 100 times in a row.</font>

763
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:31,179
<font color=#0080C0>Maybe you can get
a hobby or something.</font>

764
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:34,516
<font color=#0080C0>Surprise me once in a while.</font>

765
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,144
<font color=#0080C0>Everyone wants to give you marriage
advice when you get married.</font>

766
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:40,313
<font color=#0080C0>Some of it's helpful.
Most of it's trash.</font>

767
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:41,982
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause they don't know how
your relationship works,</font>

768
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,358
<font color=#0080C0>but everyone wants to
guide you.</font>

769
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,068
<font color=#0080C0>One of my girlfriends
told me,</font>

770
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,446
<font color=#0080C0>"If your husband acts up,
just withhold sex."</font>

771
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,824
<font color=#0080C0>And I was like,
"What did I do?"</font>

772
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:59,916
<font color=#0080C0>That punishment affects
both of us.</font>

773
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,752
<font color=#0080C0>I don't like your methods.</font>

774
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,005
<font color=#0080C0>Don't go to sleep angry,
that's another one.</font>

775
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:07,632
<font color=#0080C0>I go to sleep angry
all the time.</font>

776
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:11,052
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause he falls asleep before me,
and I'm just like--</font>

777
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:18,518
<font color=#0080C0>Oh,
you got nothin' to over think right now?</font>

778
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,649
<font color=#0080C0>Okay. Okay.</font>

779
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,985
<font color=#0080C0>I had to get used to being
responsible to another person, too.</font>

780
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:28,945
<font color=#0080C0>That was hard, man.</font>

781
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,906
<font color=#0080C0>When my husband asks me if
I paid my credit card bill,</font>

782
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:32,157
<font color=#0080C0>I gotta stop myself from bein'
like,</font>

783
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,241
<font color=#0080C0>"None of your business, bro!"</font>

784
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:38,163
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause then I remember,
like,</font>

785
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,623
<font color=#0080C0>Oh, yeah,
it is his business.</font>

786
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:42,292
<font color=#0080C0>And-- No.</font>

787
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:47,047
<font color=#0080C0>I'm not a good grown up.</font>

788
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,757
<font color=#0080C0>I love my husband,
but he can be dramatic.</font>

789
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,592
<font color=#0080C0>He can be dramatic sometimes.</font>

790
00:41:50,675 --> 00:41:51,760
<font color=#0080C0>Like last week, he sat me down, he was like,</font>

791
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:53,053
<font color=#0080C0>"We need to talk."</font>

792
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:55,263
<font color=#0080C0>And I was like,
"Uh-oh.</font>

793
00:41:55,347 --> 00:41:56,514
<font color=#0080C0>Here's the divorce."</font>

794
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:01,228
<font color=#0080C0>He said,
"Our neighbor came by today."</font>

795
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,771
<font color=#0080C0>I was like--
We have neighbors?</font>

796
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,857
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I don't be talkin'
to nobody.</font>

797
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:07,984
<font color=#0080C0>He said,
"Our neighbor came by today,</font>

798
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:11,279
<font color=#0080C0>he said that he can hear us having
conversations through the wall."</font>

799
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:14,741
<font color=#0080C0>And I was like, "Yeah.
This is New York.</font>

800
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,702
<font color=#0080C0>That's how apartments are made,
bro."</font>

801
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,039
<font color=#0080C0>"Why do you think after
every time we make love,</font>

802
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,916
<font color=#0080C0>I high five the wall?"</font>

803
00:42:30,173 --> 00:42:32,175
<font color=#0080C0>I gotta let 'em know.</font>

804
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,886
<font color=#0080C0>Gotta let 'em know
we good.</font>

805
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,013
<font color=#0080C0>He wants to get a house now.
He wants to get a house.</font>

806
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:39,182
<font color=#0080C0>I don't want to clean
a house.</font>

807
00:42:39,266 --> 00:42:41,268
<font color=#0080C0>A whole house?</font>

808
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,395
<font color=#0080C0>He's not gonna clean it.</font>

809
00:42:43,478 --> 00:42:46,481
<font color=#0080C0>We live in a less than one
bedroom apartment right now.</font>

810
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,779
<font color=#0080C0>And we are in
a cleaning stand off.</font>

811
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,532
<font color=#0080C0>I always win 'cause
I make it racial.</font>

812
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,826
<font color=#0080C0>I be like, "Why I gotta clean,
'cause I'm Puerto Rican?"</font>

813
00:43:02,956 --> 00:43:04,416
<font color=#0080C0>I told him
we can't get a house,</font>

814
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,710
<font color=#0080C0>not unless we get a maid,
and I can't do that.</font>

815
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:07,919
<font color=#0080C0>I can't get a maid.</font>

816
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,629
<font color=#0080C0>Imagine that,
I open the door,</font>

817
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,007
<font color=#0080C0>there's one of my aunts
standing right there.</font>

818
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,552
<font color=#0080C0>I be like, "Damn, tia,
you would have done this for free."</font>

819
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,598
<font color=#0080C0>"Now I gotta pay you."</font>

820
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:22,767
<font color=#0080C0>I know how much
cleaning a house--</font>

821
00:43:22,851 --> 00:43:23,977
<font color=#0080C0>I know how much work that is.</font>

822
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,603
<font color=#0080C0>I grew up in a house.</font>

823
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:29,399
<font color=#0080C0>My mom made us clean it every weekend,
both days.</font>

824
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,860
<font color=#0080C0>That's right,
'cause the weekdays were for school.</font>

825
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:35,947
<font color=#0080C0>So the weekend was for
our fun time,</font>

826
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:37,490
<font color=#0080C0>which, apparently,
was cleaning.</font>

827
00:43:40,035 --> 00:43:42,495
<font color=#0080C0>And we would get up, man,
and she would try to trick us, man.</font>

828
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:44,122
<font color=#0080C0>She would play salsa music
all loud</font>

829
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:47,459
<font color=#0080C0>like we were having a party.</font>

830
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,544
<font color=#0080C0>You'd go downstairs,
the only party guests are</font>

831
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,171
<font color=#0080C0>Windex and some paper towels.</font>

832
00:43:55,425 --> 00:43:57,177
<font color=#0080C0>She was like,
"Welcome to the party."</font>

833
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,765
<font color=#0080C0>You're not gonna trick us,
Mom, we know this ain't fun.</font>

834
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:03,475
<font color=#0080C0>But now,
every time I hear salsa music,</font>

835
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:04,893
<font color=#0080C0>I start sweeping
and washing dishes.</font>

836
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,731
<font color=#0080C0>Like Pavlov's Puerto Rican,
I gotta--</font>

837
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:11,816
<font color=#0080C0>Must-- Must clean.</font>

838
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,859
<font color=#0080C0>Must clean.</font>

839
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,823
<font color=#0080C0>My husband wants that
traditional life,</font>

840
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,367
<font color=#0080C0>he likes--
he likes when I do stuff for him.</font>

841
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,160
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
he likes when I cook for him.</font>

842
00:44:22,243 --> 00:44:26,039
<font color=#0080C0>I made my husband a
'hood delicacy not too long ago.</font>

843
00:44:26,122 --> 00:44:28,917
<font color=#0080C0>'Hood delicacy,
that's-- that's rice with an egg on top.</font>

844
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,594
<font color=#0080C0>My next 'hood delicacy
has to be chopped cheese.</font>

845
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,056
<font color=#0080C0>Uh-- Yeah.
That's right.</font>

846
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:45,683
<font color=#0080C0>But I'ma use vegan cheese,
he don't need to know.</font>

847
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:50,188
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause all my food shopping
is bougie now.</font>

848
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:52,232
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I go to bougie
supermarkets.</font>

849
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:54,025
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I grew up on
ghetto supermarkets,</font>

850
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,653
<font color=#0080C0>and I'm, like,
I ain't doin' that no more.</font>

851
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:58,822
<font color=#0080C0>Right?
You ever been to a ghetto supermarket,</font>

852
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:02,409
<font color=#0080C0>you know that it looks like
a homicide just happened.</font>

853
00:45:02,492 --> 00:45:03,910
<font color=#0080C0>No matter which way
you go into it.</font>

854
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:05,495
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
I'm gonna walk down the freezer aisle,</font>

855
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,623
<font color=#0080C0>it's gonna be ice cream
and a dead body.</font>

856
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,875
<font color=#0080C0>And I gotta hope the security
footage doesn't go viral</font>

857
00:45:10,959 --> 00:45:13,711
<font color=#0080C0>when I step over that body
to get that ice cream.</font>

858
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:15,422
<font color=#0080C0>Gonna be like,
"Oh, all right, people,</font>

859
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:17,215
<font color=#0080C0>"but I'm gonna grab this
rocky road real quick,</font>

860
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,385
<font color=#0080C0>'cause, uh, YOLO!
You know that."</font>

861
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:22,220
<font color=#0080C0>Keep it movin'.</font>

862
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,474
<font color=#0080C0>You never know who works at
a ghetto supermarket,</font>

863
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,768
<font color=#0080C0>'cause, uh,
they don't wear uniforms.</font>

864
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,272
<font color=#0080C0>They just walk around like
plain clothes cops.</font>

865
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,984
<font color=#0080C0>You just gotta look for
the angriest person,</font>

866
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,945
<font color=#0080C0>that's their-- that's their uniform,
it's anger.</font>

867
00:45:39,028 --> 00:45:41,114
<font color=#0080C0>You find that person.</font>

868
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:42,699
<font color=#0080C0>They always get annoyed
by you.</font>

869
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,242
<font color=#0080C0>Like,
no matter what you ask,</font>

870
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:46,619
<font color=#0080C0>they're so bothered
by your presence.</font>

871
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,246
<font color=#0080C0>At bougie supermarkets,
they are so nice, man,</font>

872
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:49,539
<font color=#0080C0>it doesn't matter
what you ask.</font>

873
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:50,665
<font color=#0080C0>You can ask them
to do your taxes,</font>

874
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,459
<font color=#0080C0>they'll sit with you...</font>

875
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:54,919
<font color=#0080C0>in one of the aisles
and help you out.</font>

876
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:56,588
<font color=#0080C0>Ghetto supermarket,
you ask where the milk is,</font>

877
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,757
<font color=#0080C0>they're like-- Ugh!</font>

878
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,426
<font color=#0080C0>They look at you like they're tryin'
to figure out</font>

879
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:03,678
<font color=#0080C0>whether they should
fight your or help you.</font>

880
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,597
<font color=#0080C0>They're like, "Come with me.
Damn."</font>

881
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:10,101
<font color=#0080C0>I do a lot of
bougie stuff now.</font>

882
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:12,103
<font color=#0080C0>Even stuff I don't like.</font>

883
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,981
<font color=#0080C0>I get massages.
I don't like massages.</font>

884
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:18,193
<font color=#0080C0>Being locked in a room with a
stranger that's touching me.</font>

885
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:20,528
<font color=#0080C0>I've been trying to
avoid that my whole life.</font>

886
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,283
<font color=#0080C0>Why would I do this
to myself now?</font>

887
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:27,202
<font color=#0080C0>I had a rough massage last week,
man.</font>

888
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:28,536
<font color=#0080C0>You ever had a massage
that's so rough,</font>

889
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,413
<font color=#0080C0>you be like,
"Who hurt you?"</font>

890
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,419
<font color=#0080C0>"Why are you taking this out
on my spine?"</font>

891
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,465
<font color=#0080C0>I always get so stressed out
on massages,</font>

892
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,050
<font color=#0080C0>'cause I'm either in pain,</font>

893
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,177
<font color=#0080C0>or the whole time I'm sittin'
there goin',</font>

894
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,470
<font color=#0080C0>"Don't fart, don't fart."</font>

895
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:50,725
<font color=#0080C0>"Don't fart."</font>

896
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,810
<font color=#0080C0>One time I went to
a Korean masseuse,</font>

897
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:54,562
<font color=#0080C0>and she said she was gonna
give me an intestinal massage,</font>

898
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,648
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
that's not what you wanna do, sis.</font>

899
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:01,569
<font color=#0080C0>No. Don't do that, sis.</font>

900
00:47:01,653 --> 00:47:03,279
<font color=#0080C0>There's, like,
30 years of tacos in there,</font>

901
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,614
<font color=#0080C0>you don't need to--</font>

902
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:10,370
<font color=#0080C0>You don't want to
mess with that situation.</font>

903
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,248
<font color=#0080C0>I have a personal trainer.</font>

904
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:14,832
<font color=#0080C0>That's bougie.</font>

905
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:18,461
<font color=#0080C0>His job is to shame me
into doing things.</font>

906
00:47:18,545 --> 00:47:21,422
<font color=#0080C0>Personal trainers are like
professional bullies.</font>

907
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,758
<font color=#0080C0>He still gets my lunch money,
but now I gotta do</font>

908
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,677
<font color=#0080C0>a bunch of burpies
before I give it to him.</font>

909
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,765
<font color=#0080C0>The bougiest thing I do
is see a therapist.</font>

910
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,350
<font color=#0080C0>Oh, yeah.</font>

911
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:33,893
<font color=#0080C0>My Latino family had
a moment of silence</font>

912
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:36,646
<font color=#0080C0>when they found out.</font>

913
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,773
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause Latinos don't talk to therapists,
man,</font>

914
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,651
<font color=#0080C0>we talk to Jesus or priests.</font>

915
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,571
<font color=#0080C0>That's your two options.</font>

916
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:46,155
<font color=#0080C0>I'm actually back on
speaking terms</font>

917
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:47,699
<font color=#0080C0>with my therapist right now.</font>

918
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:53,204
<font color=#0080C0>Let me tell you what happened,
though.</font>

919
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,498
<font color=#0080C0>Every year, he goes on vacation for a month,</font>

920
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,292
<font color=#0080C0>which, first of all, rude.</font>

921
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:00,962
<font color=#0080C0>Every time he leaves,
I'm like,</font>

922
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:04,173
<font color=#0080C0>"You said no one would ever
leave me again."</font>

923
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:13,182
<font color=#0080C0>I'm all passive aggressive
when he comes back,</font>

924
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,018
<font color=#0080C0>I'm like,
"How was your vacation, Alan?"</font>

925
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:21,232
<font color=#0080C0>"Did you meet any
new patients in Hawaii?"</font>

926
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:24,068
<font color=#0080C0>"Give me your phone, let me see your phone,
give me your phone."</font>

927
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,695
<font color=#0080C0>"Let me find out you got
some side patient in Hawaii</font>

928
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,156
<font color=#0080C0>you was with
this whole time."</font>

929
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,576
<font color=#0080C0>And she's just like me, some Hawaiian
Puerto Rican with abandonment issues.</font>

930
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,787
<font color=#0080C0>I just feel like
he should provide</font>

931
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:37,332
<font color=#0080C0>some sort of substitute
therapist for when he leaves.</font>

932
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,335
<font color=#0080C0>Like somebody just wheels in a TV,
like,</font>

933
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:41,878
<font color=#0080C0>"Dr. Rosenthal's
away this week,</font>

934
00:48:41,961 --> 00:48:45,673
<font color=#0080C0>so...
here's 'To Kill a Mockingbird.'</font>

935
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:48,009
<font color=#0080C0>Good luck with
your struggles."</font>

936
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,763
<font color=#0080C0>He always tells me
I need to respect boundaries,</font>

937
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:55,058
<font color=#0080C0>or maybe that was his wife, I don't know,
it was 3 a.m., I was drunk.</font>

938
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:01,105
<font color=#0080C0>Then don't give me
your cell phone number.</font>

939
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,197
<font color=#0080C0>Uh!
We're working on my insomnia now,</font>

940
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,115
<font color=#0080C0>I have terrible insomnia.</font>

941
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,785
<font color=#0080C0>If you've ever had insomnia,
you know how much it sucks.</font>

942
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,287
<font color=#0080C0>But what sucks even more is when
you tell somebody you have insomnia,</font>

943
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:18,331
<font color=#0080C0>and they tell you
how well they sleep.</font>

944
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,628
<font color=#0080C0>It never fails, I'll tell--
Any time I tell someone I have insomnia,</font>

945
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,672
<font color=#0080C0>somebody goes,
"Oh, my God, that's crazy,</font>

946
00:49:25,755 --> 00:49:27,298
<font color=#0080C0>"'cause I close my eyes,
I fall asleep like this,</font>

947
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:29,008
<font color=#0080C0>it's the most amazing
thing in the world.</font>

948
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:30,426
<font color=#0080C0>"I don't know how I do it.
I'm, like, amazing,</font>

949
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,178
<font color=#0080C0>"I just fall asleep,
it's so easy for me.</font>

950
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,222
<font color=#0080C0>"I don't need anything,
like, I don't need tea,</font>

951
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,724
<font color=#0080C0>I don't need melatonin,
I just fall asleep this, I close my eyes."</font>

952
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,563
<font color=#0080C0>Do you think you're
inspiring me</font>

953
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,899
<font color=#0080C0>to do something
I've never tried before?</font>

954
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:47,235
<font color=#0080C0>Like, I'm gonna be like,
"What, you close your eyes?"</font>

955
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,947
<font color=#0080C0>"I've been sittin'
there like this the whole time."</font>

956
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,200
<font color=#0080C0>"You're a genius."</font>

957
00:49:57,203 --> 00:49:58,913
<font color=#0080C0>I couldn't sleep last night,
man.</font>

958
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,957
<font color=#0080C0>I was just up.</font>

959
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,459
<font color=#0080C0>3 a.m.,
chillin' with my demons.</font>

960
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:06,921
<font color=#0080C0>That's all it is, man,
I was like,</font>

961
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,007
<font color=#0080C0>"What's up, insecurities?"</font>

962
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:13,469
<font color=#0080C0>"Hey, procrastination,
funny you'd be on time for this."</font>

963
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:19,392
<font color=#0080C0>You're never doing
anything productive,</font>

964
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,144
<font color=#0080C0>that's the most
frustrating thing.</font>

965
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:23,730
<font color=#0080C0>If you're like me,
you're just up rethinking</font>

966
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,273
<font color=#0080C0>conversations you had
during the day,</font>

967
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,275
<font color=#0080C0>and coming up with
better responses.</font>

968
00:50:30,653 --> 00:50:32,071
<font color=#0080C0>Or you're--
you're on the internet</font>

969
00:50:32,155 --> 00:50:34,866
<font color=#0080C0>for the next 97 hours...</font>

970
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,577
<font color=#0080C0>looking at weird
animal friendship videos.</font>

971
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:42,081
<font color=#0080C0>Which are my favorite,
by the way.</font>

972
00:50:42,165 --> 00:50:43,624
<font color=#0080C0>I love those videos,
I'm like,</font>

973
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,044
<font color=#0080C0>"A kitten and a monkey,
how'd they even meet?"</font>

974
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,966
<font color=#0080C0>"They don't hang out
in the same places.</font>

975
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,093
<font color=#0080C0>"Was the monkey
in a pet store?</font>

976
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:57,847
<font color=#0080C0>"Was the kitten in a jungle?</font>

977
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,892
<font color=#0080C0>I have to know
the rest of this."</font>

978
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:02,935
<font color=#0080C0>That's the positive stuff
on the internet.</font>

979
00:51:03,019 --> 00:51:05,062
<font color=#0080C0>There's a bunch of negative
stuff on the internet, too, man.</font>

980
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,898
<font color=#0080C0>Hate is everywhere
on the internet.</font>

981
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,066
<font color=#0080C0>But hate's gonna happen,
we can't be afraid of it.</font>

982
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:10,902
<font color=#0080C0>Happens to all of us,
and we all do it, man.</font>

983
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:13,905
<font color=#0080C0>You ever meet somebody and
right away you hate them?</font>

984
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:17,950
<font color=#0080C0>Just everything in you goes,</font>

985
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:18,993
<font color=#0080C0>nope!</font>

986
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:24,081
<font color=#0080C0>Mm-mm.</font>

987
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,335
<font color=#0080C0>Not you.</font>

988
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,088
<font color=#0080C0>I know what we need to
stop doing,</font>

989
00:51:31,172 --> 00:51:33,883
<font color=#0080C0>we need to stop hatin'
on millennials for real.</font>

990
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,760
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause it's gettin' old,
and it's gettin' tired.</font>

991
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:37,887
<font color=#0080C0>Plus, I think millennials,
all they did was</font>

992
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,972
<font color=#0080C0>look at what was historically
and systemically wrong,</font>

993
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,933
<font color=#0080C0>and then look at the rest of us,
like,</font>

994
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:45,228
<font color=#0080C0>"Y'all know you don't have to
put up with this, right?"</font>

995
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:46,479
<font color=#0080C0>And then older generations
were like,</font>

996
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,939
<font color=#0080C0>"Shut up, nerds."</font>

997
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,567
<font color=#0080C0>"What's wrong with the way things were,
man?</font>

998
00:51:51,651 --> 00:51:53,319
<font color=#0080C0>I was bullied and
I turned out fine."</font>

999
00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:56,447
<font color=#0080C0>Like-- Oh,
you're a psychopath.</font>

1000
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,700
<font color=#0080C0>You're not fine.</font>

1001
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,202
<font color=#0080C0>Like, you're a bully.</font>

1002
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,037
<font color=#0080C0>You were bullied and now
you're a terrible human,</font>

1003
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,122
<font color=#0080C0>I wouldn't use that
as a defense</font>

1004
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,874
<font color=#0080C0>against millennials.</font>

1005
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,376
<font color=#0080C0>All right, guys,
I gotta get out of here,</font>

1006
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:09,919
<font color=#0080C0>but, uh,
thank you all for coming out tonight,</font>

1007
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:11,796
<font color=#0080C0>you all have been amazing.</font>

1008
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,549
<font color=#0080C0>I had an amazing time with you.</font>

1009
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,592
<font color=#0080C0>I love you all.
Thank you so much.</font>

1010
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:31,107
<font color=#0080C0>There is one more thing.</font>

1011
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,693
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you so much for standing up.
Oh, my God.</font>

1012
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:37,029
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you.</font>

1013
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:39,407
<font color=#0080C0>You can all sit,
you can all sit.</font>

1014
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,492
<font color=#0080C0>But thank you.
You're a very standy crowd,</font>

1015
00:52:41,576 --> 00:52:43,661
<font color=#0080C0>I like it.</font>

1016
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:46,122
<font color=#0080C0>I like your--
your ability to squat and stand,</font>

1017
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,498
<font color=#0080C0>I'm envious.</font>

1018
00:52:47,582 --> 00:52:51,377
<font color=#0080C0>I'm envious of your
knee strength.</font>

1019
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,046
<font color=#0080C0>There is a story that I
wanted to share with you guys</font>

1020
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,173
<font color=#0080C0>before I let you guys go,
so bear with me.</font>

1021
00:52:56,257 --> 00:52:58,259
<font color=#0080C0>First of all,
I want to dedicate this special</font>

1022
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,802
<font color=#0080C0>to a friend of mine
who recently passed.</font>

1023
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:00,970
<font color=#0080C0>This is for Angelo Lozada.</font>

1024
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:11,022
<font color=#0080C0>I started comedy when I was,
uh, 17 years old.</font>

1025
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,107
<font color=#0080C0>Started at 17,
and I've been doing it</font>

1026
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,360
<font color=#0080C0>probably about 22 years,
a little over 22 years now.</font>

1027
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,904
<font color=#0080C0>And, um, I know,
some of you are like,</font>

1028
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:21,157
<font color=#0080C0>"She wasted her life."
No.</font>

1029
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,285
<font color=#0080C0>No,
I-- I discovered comedy at 14 years old.</font>

1030
00:53:24,368 --> 00:53:27,204
<font color=#0080C0>I was, uh,
channel surfing through my parents' cable,</font>

1031
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:29,165
<font color=#0080C0>unbeknownst to them.</font>

1032
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,459
<font color=#0080C0>I was watching a horror movie
and I thought I heard footsteps,</font>

1033
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,711
<font color=#0080C0>so I switched the channel 'cause,
you know, I didn't want to die.</font>

1034
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:38,633
<font color=#0080C0>Um, so I switched the channel,
and I switched it to comedy.</font>

1035
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:40,801
<font color=#0080C0>I didn't even know,
I just kind of switched it,</font>

1036
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:44,680
<font color=#0080C0>and the woman on stage,
the woman doing a special was Brett Butler.</font>

1037
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,265
<font color=#0080C0>And it was
"Brett Butler Sold Out."</font>

1038
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:48,392
<font color=#0080C0>And that was the first
comedy special I ever saw.</font>

1039
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,727
<font color=#0080C0>And I didn't know what
comedy was,</font>

1040
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:51,395
<font color=#0080C0>I didn't know
anything about it,</font>

1041
00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,190
<font color=#0080C0>but when I saw this woman there,
I was completely mesmerized.</font>

1042
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,484
<font color=#0080C0>She was beautiful,
she was smart, she was funny.</font>

1043
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,444
<font color=#0080C0>at 14 years old,
I understood her sarcasm,</font>

1044
00:53:58,527 --> 00:53:59,862
<font color=#0080C0>I understood everything.</font>

1045
00:53:59,946 --> 00:54:02,114
<font color=#0080C0>And immediately,
I knew...</font>

1046
00:54:02,198 --> 00:54:03,741
<font color=#0080C0>that's what I want to do
with my life.</font>

1047
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,159
<font color=#0080C0>And you have to understand,
like,</font>

1048
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,619
<font color=#0080C0>I grew up watching
Latino television,</font>

1049
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,537
<font color=#0080C0>so whenever I saw
a woman on camera,</font>

1050
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,415
<font color=#0080C0>she was either scantily clad,</font>

1051
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:14,752
<font color=#0080C0>or legitimately
dressed like a clown.</font>

1052
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:16,420
<font color=#0080C0>This was the first time
I saw a woman</font>

1053
00:54:16,504 --> 00:54:19,632
<font color=#0080C0>controlling a room
with her intellect alone.</font>

1054
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:21,050
<font color=#0080C0>And I was blown away,
and I was like,</font>

1055
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,593
<font color=#0080C0>this is what I want to do
with my life,</font>

1056
00:54:22,677 --> 00:54:24,220
<font color=#0080C0>I don't know how,
but I'm gonna do it.</font>

1057
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,180
<font color=#0080C0>And then,
probably about a week later,</font>

1058
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,516
<font color=#0080C0>I saw George Lopez.</font>

1059
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:31,477
<font color=#0080C0>And now I've seen a woman,
and a Latino,</font>

1060
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,853
<font color=#0080C0>and I was like--</font>

1061
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,605
<font color=#0080C0>I'm a hybrid mix of
both of those.</font>

1062
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,278
<font color=#0080C0>So in my little
14 year old brain,</font>

1063
00:54:41,362 --> 00:54:42,822
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,</font>

1064
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:44,657
<font color=#0080C0>"There's no reason
I can't do this,"</font>

1065
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,158
<font color=#0080C0>'cause you know how
when you're a teenager,</font>

1066
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:49,954
<font color=#0080C0>you think nothing bad
can happen?</font>

1067
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,206
<font color=#0080C0>I was just there
in that mindset,</font>

1068
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,376
<font color=#0080C0>and I remember thinking,
like,</font>

1069
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,461
<font color=#0080C0>having no fear.</font>

1070
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:59,088
<font color=#0080C0>Just going for it.</font>

1071
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,464
<font color=#0080C0>With nothing behind it,</font>

1072
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:03,009
<font color=#0080C0>other than the pure force
of my belief</font>

1073
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:06,220
<font color=#0080C0>that this was what
I was meant to do.</font>

1074
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,223
<font color=#0080C0>And what I want
from this special</font>

1075
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,350
<font color=#0080C0>more than anything else</font>

1076
00:55:11,434 --> 00:55:15,521
<font color=#0080C0>is to be for that next kid
that's watching at home</font>

1077
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:18,607
<font color=#0080C0>what Brett Butler and
George Lopez were to me.</font>

1078
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,286
<font color=#0080C0>You know...</font>

1079
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,871
<font color=#0080C0>coming where I come from,</font>

1080
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,123
<font color=#0080C0>you don't get told
to live your dreams.</font>

1081
00:55:34,206 --> 00:55:36,459
<font color=#0080C0>You get told to survive.</font>

1082
00:55:36,542 --> 00:55:38,586
<font color=#0080C0>You're told the opposite.</font>

1083
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,629
<font color=#0080C0>That dreams are stupid.</font>

1084
00:55:40,713 --> 00:55:41,839
<font color=#0080C0>You know, that dreams,</font>

1085
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,175
<font color=#0080C0>they are never gonna happen.</font>

1086
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,386
<font color=#0080C0>And I guess I never really...</font>

1087
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,597
<font color=#0080C0>believed that for one second.</font>

1088
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,142
<font color=#0080C0>And it was the support of
my family and this faith</font>

1089
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,144
<font color=#0080C0>that this was what
I was supposed to do</font>

1090
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:58,397
<font color=#0080C0>that kind of kept me going.</font>

1091
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:02,693
<font color=#0080C0>And so I think the message
I want people at home to get,</font>

1092
00:56:02,777 --> 00:56:05,154
<font color=#0080C0>and you guys to leave with
is that</font>

1093
00:56:05,237 --> 00:56:07,073
<font color=#0080C0>if you're sitting there wondering,
like,</font>

1094
00:56:07,156 --> 00:56:09,075
<font color=#0080C0>should I go for it,
should I, you know,</font>

1095
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,660
<font color=#0080C0>try to reach my goals,
reach my dreams,</font>

1096
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,913
<font color=#0080C0>the answer is absolutely.</font>

1097
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:17,249
<font color=#0080C0>I was just a little girl
in the South Bronx</font>

1098
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:21,629
<font color=#0080C0>who had a dream bigger than
she could even imagine.</font>

1099
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,005
<font color=#0080C0>Had a dream that</font>

1100
00:56:23,089 --> 00:56:24,882
<font color=#0080C0>nobody believed
she should have had.</font>

1101
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:31,305
<font color=#0080C0>I had no advantages
over anybody.</font>

1102
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:35,184
<font color=#0080C0>The only advantage I had was
I didn't quit.</font>

1103
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:37,019
<font color=#0080C0>So thank you.</font>

1104
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,354
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you.</font>
