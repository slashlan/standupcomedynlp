so very much.</font>

1045
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,160
<font color="#ffff00">Over the 13 years that me and Lauren
have been together,</font>

1046
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,950
<font color="#ffff00">they've been great,
but I watched her mom unfortunately</font>

1047
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:45,290
<font color="#ffff00">forget how to walk, how to talk,
how to eat on her own,</font>

1048
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,880
<font color="#ffff00">how to care for herself.</font>

1049
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,420
<font color="#ffff00">The effect on Lauren during this time
was brutal.</font>

1050
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,430
<font color="#ffff00">If you Google Alzheimer's,
the first thing you see</font>

1051
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,220
<font color="#ffff00">is that there is no treatment,</font>

1052
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,180
<font color="#ffff00">and that there is no known cure,</font>

1053
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,600
<font color="#ffff00">which is obviously pretty upsetting.</font>

1054
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,060
<font color="#ffff00">So we did the only thing we knew how to do
as comedy writers.</font>

1055
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,690
<font color="#ffff00">We gathered some friends together
to host a show</font>

<font color="#ffff00">-called Hilarity for Charity.

1057

Hilarity for Charity has developed</font>

1058
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,360

1059
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,660
<font color="#ffff00">We've raised awareness</font>

1060
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,330
<font color="#ffff00">and engaged with young people
across the country.</font>

1061
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:20,870
<font color="#ffff00">We've hosted support groups</font>

home-care grant program,</font>

1064
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:30,000

really important research</font>

1065
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:32,130

00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:34,050

1067
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,430
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't realize that caring for someone
with Alzheimer's</font>

1068
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,640
<font color="#ffff00">is a 24 hour a day,
seven day a week thing.</font>

1069
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,600
<font color="#ffff00">The toll it was taking on Lauren's dad</font>

1070
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,770
<font color="#ffff00">honestly made us worry we were
gonna lose him before her mom.</font>

1071
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,480
<font color="#ffff00">Luckily, our family is fortunate</font>

1072
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,150
<font color="#ffff00">in that we can afford
to keep my mother-in-law at home</font>

1073
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,650
<font color="#ffff00">with wonderful caretakers.</font>

are not in that position.</font>

1075
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:59,660
<font color="#ffff00">So, through our experience in working
with my mom's amazing caregivers,</font>

1076
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:03,540
<font color="#ffff00">we decided to form a partnership
with a national home-care agency,</font>

and as they do,</font>

reconciling those things.</font>

how sad it all is.</font>

1115
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:08,830
<font color="#ffff00">But over the years, what we realized
is that we need to talk about that,</font>

1116
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:12,290
<font color="#ffff00">because a lot of people
have sadness in their lives</font>

like it shouldn't be there.</font>

1118
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,840
<font color="#ffff00">And through hearing other people
talk about it,</font>

how sad we were,</font>

1121
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,680
<font color="#ffff00">our friends wouldn't have known
that we needed help,</font>

start this charity.</font>
