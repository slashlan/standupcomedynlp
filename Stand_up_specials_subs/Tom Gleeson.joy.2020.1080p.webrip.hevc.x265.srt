1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,220
This show is called Joy.
I guess it's a joy to be here.

2
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,980
And did you think
that was your head before? When you...

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,180
You probably did.
You thought "That's fuckin'... Oh, no."

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,540
Now you have to put up with
that disappointment for the whole show.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,980
And I've to put up with
that disappointment for the whole show.

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,540
I don't know what you're laughing at,
you've got the same head.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,460
So do you, so do you.

8
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,540
I am a section of the community.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,660
Another one at the back
G'day, mate. How are you?

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,940
I've been doing this show for a while.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,460
I actually started in Queensland
earlier in the year

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,780
and I did the show at the Queensland
Performing Arts Centre.

13
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,460
And it was beautiful. It was no
Mulhouse Theatre in Melbourne.

14
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,140
It was fucking bigger. Anyway...

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,660
I did this show at the Opera House.
I thought, why tape it here?

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,860
I'll pick a tiny shithole.
But anyway, I don't know.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,980
I don't know why I did that.
I don't know why I did that.

18
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,780
Other people will think, "Opera House,
that's the pinnacle of your career."

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,540
Not me, I thought, I need a smaller venue
that's more obscure, but anyway...

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,780
Preferably it has never been
on a postcard.

21
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,220
And I chose this place. Anyway...

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,780
So I'm doing a show
at the Queensland Performing Arts Centre,

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,180
and I finish the show
and it was wonderful.

24
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,580
Then I walk out, and I cross the road...

25
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,540
And I don't know about you,
but I cross the road when I want to,

26
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,100
OK, because I'm an adult.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,540
But I crossed the road
straight into the Queensland police,

28
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,020
and I got done for jaywalking.

29
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,660
Now, I'm an adult,
I cross the road when I want to.

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,020
You know, I don't...

31
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,220
If I see a gap in the traffic,
that's mine.

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,500
I'm not waiting for some fuckin' green man
to tell me what to do.

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,980
I will cross when I want to,
thank you very much.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,340
So I just crossed the road and I walked
straight into the Queensland police

35
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,740
and he said, "Oi, what are you doing?"
I'm like, "I'm being an adult."

36
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,500
He said, "Do you have any ID?"
And I'm like, "No.

37
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,820
'Cause I don't need it anymore."

38
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,740
I can get into pubs.
It's quite easy for me.

39
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,620
If I ever get asked for ID,
I think, "If you think I'm under 18,

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,420
I am not well," just quietly.

41
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,100
So I said, "No, I do not have any ID."

42
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,100
And he said, "What's your name?"

43
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,460
Now, I'm not trying to make the point
that, you know,

44
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,260
he should've known who I was. Right?

45
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,700
That is not the point I'm trying to make.

46
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,260
Like, I understand that some people
don't watch the ABC.

47
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,180
That's fine.

48
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,860
Not everybody watches TV.

49
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,300
Some people don't watch the ABC.

50
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,540
I find it attracts
a more intelligent audience.

51
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,900
I'm saying it's smarter viewer, and I was
talking to the Queensland police.

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,900
Anyway...

53
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,940
Like, as a Venn diagram,
those two circles don't meet.

54
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,340
You know what I mean?

55
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,500
And he wouldn't get that joke.

56
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,900
So he says, "What's your name?" Right?

57
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,900
And I go, "Tom."

58
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,260
And I'm not making this up,
he goes, "How do you spell that?"

59
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,500
And I thought maybe he's taking the piss,
I'm happy with that.

60
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,660
I take the piss. I was looking
for a twinkle in the eye.

61
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,380
There was no twinkle in the eye.

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,580
He was dead inside. Anyway...

63
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,420
"How do you spell that?"
I'm like, "T-O-M."

64
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,740
And he said, "Is that short for anything?"

65
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,180
And I'm like, "Yeah."

66
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,860
"What?"

67
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,460
"Thomas."

68
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,380
"How do you spell that?"

69
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,060
"T-H-O-M-A-S.

70
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,300
You know Tom? You know it's...
Any Tom, Dick or Harry.

71
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,220
You know that expression?
You know that...

72
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,900
It's just... Any Tom, Dick or...
That means it's fucking common.

73
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,140
Yeah? Like...

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,980
And Tom's the easiest to spell
out of those three." Anyway.

75
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,980
"What's your surname?" I go, "Gleeson."

76
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,620
It's all right. G-L-E-E

77
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,140
S-O-N."

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,460
And the only reason I tell you this story
is because this was all happening

79
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,540
in front of a billboard of me
that was 12 feet tall.

80
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,260
Twelve feet fuckin' tall

81
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,740
on the side of the Arts Centre.

82
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:44,460
Like, when he first asked for ID,
I didn't quite have it within me to go,

83
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,140
"Fuckin' there!"

84
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,260
Ah.

85
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,780
This is gonna go well tonight,
I can feel it.

86
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,340
Really gonna put a lot of effort in.

87
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,380
I was talkin'
to my four-year-old boy, right? And...

88
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,140
I was talkin' to him the other day,

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,260
and he goes, "Dad." I'm like, "Yeah."

90
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,580
And he goes,
"I swallowed a two dollar coin."

91
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,380
"I swallowed a two dollar coin,
but it's OK 'cause it's an accident."

92
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,380
And I thought he snookered me there,
hasn't he?

93
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,380
That's a good trick. He's gonna
push me into a corner there.

94
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,260
"It was an accident." 'Cause he knows
I can't get angry at him

95
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,820
'cause if I get angry at him,
he'll start to keep secrets.

96
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,380
Right? So now I'm in this weird position,

97
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,020
where I have to praise him
for being an idiot.

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,900
And that doesn't come naturally to me.

99
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,420
So I go, "Well done, boy,
thanks for telling Dad.

100
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,100
Thank you. Thanks for telling Dad.
You've done the right thing."

101
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,860
And then I go
to the children's hospital website,

102
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,540
and it's no big deal, I look it up,
and you just got to wait it out, you know?

103
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,740
You just got to wait
for it to pass through. No big deal.

104
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,660
And I'll be honest with you,
it was exciting.

105
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,940
You know what I mean? I knew what
it was like to be in the Gold Rush.

106
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,660
You know, like,
"Dad, I need to go to the toilet."

107
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,420
I'm like, "Oh, this could be it!"

108
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,220
Could be on. Oh, anything? Nothing.
Oh, what a shame.

109
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,180
I'd feel so dispirited, you know.

110
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,660
"Dad, I need to go to the toilet."
"We're back on."

111
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
"Is there anything? No, oh, man..."

112
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,340
You know.

113
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,340
Now I've got a colander I can't look at
the same way again.

114
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,140
Whenever I'm stranded in Catalonia,
I get flashbacks.

115
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
And I'll be honest with you,
his output was impressive.

116
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,620
You know what I mean?
Like, it looked like it was done by a man.

117
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,220
I was, like, "How did you do that?
That is outrageous, mate.

118
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,540
"Like, that is the size of a...
How did you..."

119
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,340
Like, did I leave the back door open
and a tradie came in and snapped one off

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,660
and then put my boy on top of it
to cover their tracks.

121
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,180
"That is fuckin' outrageous.

122
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,900
That is the same width
as your waist, mate.

123
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,220
You must be all colon.
I should change your name to Colin."

124
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,100
Anyway, so,

125
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,900
24 hours go past
and there's no result.

126
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,340
And we've got to go overseas.
We've just got to go.

127
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,060
And, you know, we just... We gotta leave,
like, that was already booked.

128
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,260
And anyway, I feel bad
'cause now he's smuggling currency

129
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,860
across international borders.

130
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,540
Turned him into a gold coin donation mule.

131
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,740
You know, we get
to the X-rays at security, you know.

132
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,220
I feel like staying to the staff,

133
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,060
"Can I put him in the tray? Can I?

134
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,740
He's got two dollars up his ass.

135
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,380
And I just wanna know where it is.
It's more a point of curiosity for me now.

136
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,500
Is it up to his duodenum. Where is it?

137
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,420
If you find it, you can keep it."

138
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,300
Anyway, so we get to the holidays,

139
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:59,060
and now it's been like 48 hours, and I go
to the children's hospital website

140
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,380
and it's an issue.

141
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,540
They recommend
that you go to the hospital, right?

142
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,740
'Cause it could be lodged.

143
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,460
And I'm like, "Oh, man, you know.

144
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,900
I'm overseas, we gotta go
to the hospital, it's gonna be expensive,

145
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,780
I'm already two dollars down."

146
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,660
Anyway, he goes, "Dad." I'm like, "Yeah."

147
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,940
"You know how
I swallowed the two dollar coin?"

148
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,380
I'm like, "Yeah." "Just tricking."

149
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,300
"That's a funny trick, wasn't it, Dad?"

150
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,020
I spent two days sifting through shit

151
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,780
for gold that was never there.

152
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,780
Now I know how everyone else
at the Logies felt.

153
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,060
I don't feel like that.

154
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,540
They do.

155
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,620
I've been teaching my children
how to be Australian.

156
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,180
OK, so when it's my turn to cook,
we go to the Chinese restaurant.

157
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,540
'Cause that's what we do
in Australia, you know.

158
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,500
When you can't be fucked doing a job,
you outsource the labor to Asia.

159
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,660
It's what we do.

160
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,900
We don't manufacture anymore.

161
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,980
So I took them to the Chinese restaurant,
and I show them how it's done.

162
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,780
I'm like, "Kids, all right,
this is how we do it, OK?

163
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,900
"We order the sweet and sour pork.

164
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,860
And it has to be pink,
and it has to be fluoro.

165
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,900
And it has to look unlike anything
that has ever been cooked in China.

166
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,180
And then we order the honey prawns.

167
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,860
And they are more delicious the further
inland you are when you eat them."

168
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,100
You know
where my favorite honey prawns are?

169
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,900
Fuckin' Dubbo, that's where they are!

170
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,980
If ever I see a Chinese restaurant
near a fish market,

171
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,780
I don't risk it. They might be fresh,
and I don't wanna know about it.

172
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,540
I like my honey prawns
to be snap frozen in 1988,

173
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,780
thawed out in the '90s, and cooked
during the Howard era.

174
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,380
That's the way I like my honey prawns.

175
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,860
I like my honey prawns
to be Heritage listed!

176
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,420
And then, when they ask you
for the chopsticks,

177
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,540
you just go, you just go, "Yes!"

178
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,900
Regardless of your skill level.

179
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,980
'Cause you just do your best.

180
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,500
You know what I mean?
You just do your best.

181
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,860
'Cause you know when you're
fumbling around like a fuckwit,

182
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,500
the staff would just walk up
and patronizingly

183
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,620
put down a spoon without saying a word.
They're like...

184
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,500
And then for dessert,
you either order the lychees

185
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,900
which taste like a smell.

186
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,540
"I'm eating a fucking fragrance over here.
What is this?"

187
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,780
Or you get the fried ice cream.

188
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,460
And if you get the fried ice cream,
it's compulsory that someone

189
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,540
at the table has to go,
"How the fuck did they do that?

190
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,780
I mean, it's frozen, but it's fried.
I don't get it.

191
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,700
How do they...
What kind of voodoo is this?

192
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,060
Fuckin', Peter,
how did you do this shit?"

193
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,940
I actually find going to the restaurant
with my children easier

194
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,180
than going to the restaurant
without my children.

195
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,100
And you'll agree with me that it's easy

196
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,820
if you agree that being annoying
is easier than being annoyed.

197
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,500
Being annoyed takes effort,
you know what I mean?

198
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,940
Like, it's... Like, that's...
When people are annoyed,

199
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,380
they upset themselves
more than the people they're upsetting.

200
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,700
Like, being annoyed takes effort.
I know 'cause I see the people

201
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,060
on the tables next to us.

202
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,700
I like the people who try to recruit

203
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,380
other tables to their misery,
you know? Like...

204
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,300
At our table, we don't give a shit.
We're having great fun.

205
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,220
"Hey, kids, look, you can use
the chopsticks as drumsticks."

206
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,620
"Have a second pint of lemonade,
I don't give a fuck."

207
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,420
"Who wants a honey prawn, open your gob."

208
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,940
"Hey, look, you can tap dance
the prawn chips into the carpet.

209
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,460
"Kids, you should do it, too. Come on."

210
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,300
"Look, you can use the Lazy Susan
like you're a DJ."

211
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,540
I like to sic my children onto people
I don't like the look of.

212
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,780
I'll say to my boy,

213
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:11,260
"Go and wipe your nose
on that sourpuss. Go on."

214
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,580
Uh...

215
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,660
"Oh, I'm so sorry."

216
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,220
I have no idea why he does that.

217
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,300
Here's two dollars, mate.
Don't put it up your ass, all right?"

218
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
I was in a pub in Sydney.

219
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,460
And everyone was drunk and having fun,
so they closed.

220
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,220
Well, we can't keep doing this.

221
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,220
Someone might graze their knee
or get a sniffle, so they close.

222
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,020
I don't know if you know,
but in Sydney, too,

223
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,540
when they close a pub, they close quick.

224
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,940
You know what I mean?
When they go last drinks,

225
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,420
you don't hear the word "drinks."

226
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,820
They just go, "Last..." And then you're
out on the street. You're like, "Oh!

227
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,220
How did I get out here?"

228
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,260
But I didn't wanna leave
because I couldn't find my jacket, right?

229
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,300
So I just said, "No, no, no.

230
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,140
I'll just find my jacket
and then I'll leave."

231
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,980
And they're like, "No, you won't.
Get the fuck out of here, buddy."

232
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,300
And I was like, "No, no,
I will find my jacket.

233
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,140
It's a leather jacket, I like it.
It's quite expensive.

234
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,140
And after I've found it, then I'll leave,
if that's not too much to ask."

235
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,940
They're like, "We don't give a fuck, mate.
Get the fuck out of here."

236
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,020
Now, I've got this problem

237
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,940
where, when I've had a few drinks,

238
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,380
I become really, really correct.

239
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,780
I become well thought out and charismatic.

240
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,740
At a volume.

241
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,020
So I was like, "No, I will find
my leather jacket and then I'll leave."

242
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,460
And I started to look
for my jacket obnoxiously.

243
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,140
Like, "Oh, it's got to be here somewhere.

244
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,140
Oh, well, we'll find it
and then we'll leave.

245
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,340
You know, if you all help me,
we could all get out of here a bit sooner.

246
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:26,780
You work in hospitality, maybe you should
try being a bit fucking hospitable!"

247
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,540
Anyway, so...

248
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:36,340
The bouncer, he was immune to my charms.

249
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,140
He actually did a trick
I'd never seen before.

250
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,220
I had my phone sitting in my top pocket,
just sitting there.

251
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,380
And he just pulled it out, whip,
and put it on the footpath outside.

252
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,540
And of course, I'd had a few drinks,

253
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,740
I'm like, "Oh, hang on,
that's my phone. Oh!

254
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,100
"Oh!

255
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,820
"Oh, you can't do that to my phone, mate."

256
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,620
Pick up my phone, door behind me...

257
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,420
I'm like, "Oh, bullshit."

258
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,220
There's nothing worse than being
outsmarted by someone dumber than you.

259
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,500
You know what I mean?

260
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,260
It's a dirty feeling, you know.

261
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,660
Felt like I let my uni down.

262
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,580
If I'd had my wherewithal,
when he took my phone,

263
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,460
when he took it,
I should've just gone, "Oh!

264
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,780
Hang on, now I've lost my phone as well.

265
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,860
Oh, it's probably in my jacket.
Now we definitely have to find my jacket.

266
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,340
Come on, everyone,
the search is back on. Let's go!

267
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,180
We're gonna be here all night."

268
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,340
So the next morning,
I wake up feeling regretful,

269
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,380
but I still don't have my jacket.
So I think, "You know what?

270
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,940
I'll ring the pub, try my luck," right?

271
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,540
And I get on to a different manager,

272
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,580
which is handy, OK?

273
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,380
And he says, "Well, I've got good news.

274
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,340
Um, a woman left her number.
She has your jacket."

275
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,380
And I was like, "OK."

276
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,820
So I called Debra,
and she's like,  "Hello."

277
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,060
And I'm like, "Hi.

278
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,220
I believe you have my jacket."

279
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,340
"Yeah."

280
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,500
"Why?"

281
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,580
"Well, I saw your leather jacket
sitting on the back of a chair,

282
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,940
and it was left unattended,

283
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,580
and I was worried that someone
might steal it.

284
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,460
So I took your jacket back to my house
for safekeeping."

285
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,300
"OK.

286
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,420
Were you worried
that someone I didn't know

287
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,700
might take my leather jacket
back to their house?"

288
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,100
"Yeah."

289
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,820
"That's what you've done.

290
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,460
I don't know who you are."

291
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,020
"Yes, you do. I'm Debra.

292
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,100
You rang me."

293
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,300
"OK.

294
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,820
Um, what are we gonna do now?"

295
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,180
"Where are you staying?"

296
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,100
"Um, I'm staying at the Hilton,
in the city."

297
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,220
"All right, I'll meet you there."

298
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,020
"OK."

299
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,740
So, I went down to the foyer
and I'm just waiting.

300
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
I don't know what she looks like.

301
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,500
And this car pulls up, and it's Debra
with, I presume, her husband.

302
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,980
And they just pull up,
wind down the window just a little bit,

303
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,100
and then just give me my leather jacket
like it's a Big Mac at the drive-through.

304
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,260
Just like, "There you go."
And I just take it.

305
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,220
And before I can say thank you, they just
wind up their window and drive off.

306
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,540
And I'm like, "Thank you!"

307
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,740
And I'm like,

308
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,260
"What the fuck was that about?

309
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,780
Like, what is going on with my life?"

310
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,060
So I did what I always do
when weird shit happens to me.

311
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,340
I rang me younger brother.

312
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,220
And I don't know why, he's always
the perfect person to ring,

313
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,220
so I just rang him up. And I said,
"Bro, the weirdest thing happened to me.

314
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,340
This woman called Debra
just took my leather jacket

315
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,660
from the pub last night,
kept it overnight hostage at her place

316
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,340
and then just released it back to me
the next day, with no explanation.

317
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,020
What the fuck is going on with my life?"

318
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,980
And my brother goes, "Oh, bro.

319
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,420
I know what's happening.

320
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,340
I reckon she's a fan.

321
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,180
I reckon she's a fan of yours
and she took your leather jacket.

322
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,900
She laid it out on her loungeroom floor,
and she fucked on it.

323
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,820
That's what happened, bro.

324
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,820
Or even worse, her husband
put on your leather jacket,

325
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,820
pretended to be you, and rooted her.

326
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,820
This incident will now be known
as "Debbie Does Jacket."

327
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,340
And now he calls me jacket "Debbie."

328
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,500
I can't wear it
to family functions anymore

329
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,420
because he's, like,
"Ah, you're wearing Debbie, are ya?

330
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,260
Good on you, bro. Turn around so I can
see the bum print in the back of it."

331
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,820
This feels like a very polite show
at the Malthouse.

332
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,220
There has been no heckling yet.

333
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,020
Which is a shame.

334
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,660
I leave big gaps.

335
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,740
Get on with it!

336
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,180
It's your lucky day.

337
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,100
- What did you say?
- It's your lucky day.

338
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,020
It's my lucky day
that there are no hecklers?

339
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,100
You haven't seen what I do to them.

340
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,580
No, well, thank you very much
for your minor contribution.

341
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,820
I appreciate it.

342
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,780
I understand as a heckler
there's a lot of pressure.

343
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
There's cameras here,
and you're like, "Well...

344
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,100
"This has to be
fuckin' professional standard."

345
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,580
And you'd be right, 'cause all you came up
with is "It's your lucky day." So...

346
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,580
See, that's the thing,
as a heckler, you're an amateur,

347
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,100
so you're like, you're a bit too keen.
You're like...

348
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,940
'Cause I've known this all the time
in the world. You don't realize that,

349
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,100
so your heart is fuckin' racing
right now, whereas...

350
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,340
my heart is throbbing more slowly
than an old person on their deathbed.

351
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,340
- I've all the time...
- At least that would be funnier.

352
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,900
What's that?

353
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,660
You're one of the most gutless
hecklers in this room.

354
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,540
You know what you are?

355
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,260
You're a person driving your car
down the road,

356
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,220
you saw an accident, so you thought
you'd drive your car into the side of it,

357
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,940
and then claim that you had
something to do with it.

358
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,580
"I fuckin' started that."

359
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,940
You're close to a coward's punch
during a pub fight,

360
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,940
that's what you are.

361
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,020
I was dealing with this person,
I'll get to you in a sec.

362
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,580
Turns out it was funnier, doesn't it?

363
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,100
No, I don't mind heckles,
it doesn't really worry me.

364
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,540
Even when there cameras are here,
it's fine.

365
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,220
I mean, well, that's not true.
Someone did heckle me,

366
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,860
and I lost my rag.

367
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,860
It was in Nelson Bay, New South Wales.
And it sounds like nothing, right?

368
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,540
Sounds as benign as,
"It's your lucky night."

369
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,020
Or "Get on with it."

370
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,500
Or at least, "It was funny though."

371
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,500
It sounds like less than that.

372
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,700
But someone just yelled out,
from the back of there,

373
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,140
and they just yelled out,
"You're not a redhead!"

374
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,660
And I was like, "What?"

375
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,580
"I said, 'You're not a redhead.'"

376
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:31,180
Now, I know my hair's
falling out and it's faded.

377
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,940
I know. But I said to this guy,

378
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,900
"You can't take that fucking misery
away from me!"

379
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,860
That's part of who I am.
I haven't just taken on the affectations

380
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,100
for the lifestyle benefits,
'cause there are none.

381
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,420
It's not a fashion show.

382
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,780
It's like I've got an arm
that looks like a giraffe's neck.

383
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,540
I didn't go into a...

384
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,700
I didn't go into a beauty salon
and say, 'Can I get a spray tan, please?

385
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,500
'And can you use the gun
with the dirty nozzle? Thank you.

386
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,340
'Thanks. Do the other arm, too.

387
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,900
'Lovely.'"

388
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,020
So I said to this guy,
"You can't take that misery away from me.

389
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Like, I can't make up
remembering in 1982,

390
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,380
back before sunblock was waterproof.

391
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,700
You probably don't remember it.

392
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,380
Maybe you don't... I remember it!

393
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,700
You used to put on sunblock,
you'd go for a swim,

394
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,700
the sunblock would wash off, right?

395
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,860
You'd get out, then you'd be
sunburned to the shitter.

396
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:26,940
So for the rest of the holidays,
you'd have to put on a Greg Chappell hat,

397
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,820
you'd have your collar turned up,
and your sleeves rolled down,

398
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,620
on your long-sleeved checkered shirt,

399
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,220
and everyone was more than happy
to tell you you look like a fuckwit.

400
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,300
People with their full tan,
'Oh, look at you, you little fuckwit.'

401
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,540
That's... It's a fucking
genetic disorder!

402
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,540
Why don't you go and walk around
someone in a wheelchair

403
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,220
while you're at it, you fuckhead?"
Anyway...

404
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,020
So I said to this guy,
"In case you haven't noticed,

405
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,140
I've lost my fuckin' temper!

406
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,940
Where do you think that came from?"

407
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,980
So, yeah, this is my lucky night.

408
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,620
I'm 45. I don't know if you know,
but I am. I'm 45.

409
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,980
And I don't... Whatever age I am,
I'm happy with it. I like it.

410
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,220
Some people are frightened
of their birthdays, you know what I mean?

411
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,500
Like, people say,
"Oh, my birthday's coming up."

412
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,820
You're like, "Oh, how old are you?"
They're like, "Oh, don't ask."

413
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,900
Whatever age I've been,
I've always thought,

414
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,780
anyone younger than me,
I'm like, "What would you know?"

415
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,220
Anyone older than me,
I'm like, "Don't tell me what to do."

416
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,620
And I'm getting more specific,
the older I get. All right?

417
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,700
I'm 45, if you're 44,
"What would you know?"

418
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,860
Forty-six? "Don't tell me what to do."

419
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,380
People in their 30s
look like teenagers to me now.

420
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,820
I don't know when that happened.

421
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,260
Like, I was in my 30s just then.

422
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:55,180
And now, I'm just, all of a sudden,
they... Like, I'll see someone,

423
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,700
like, at a tram stop, with ripped jeans
and fiddling around on their phone...

424
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:04,620
And I'll be like, "Own a house.
What are you doing?"

425
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,540
Just go and buy one. They're for sale.

426
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,260
You're allowed to buy them
whenever you want.

427
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,300
You could buy one today if you wanted."

428
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,780
They're there with their
stainless steel reusable water bottle,

429
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,300
"Gotta rehydrate."

430
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,860
Look like babies.

431
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,940
"I've gotta rehydrate."

432
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,660
"I've gotta rehydrate."

433
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,580
I work at the ABC now. They're everywhere.

434
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,820
Everyone's got a stainless steel
reusable water bottle.

435
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,300
"I've gotta rehydrate."

436
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,900
We didn't use to have them, did we?

437
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,220
We just used to put
a cup under a tap, and it worked.

438
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,500
You know how I know?
We survived! We made it!

439
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,820
There wasn't a mass extinction
of Australians through dehydration.

440
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,900
Like we went coring our way around the CBD
in the '90s like Burke and Wills, going,

441
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,420
"Water!

442
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,060
Water!

443
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,500
Water!

444
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,260
Gotta rehydrate."

445
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,460
I know why it's happened.
We need the reusable water bottles

446
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,380
'cause we had too many
plastic water bottles,

447
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,100
and it's bad for the environment.

448
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,980
And we had the plastic water bottles

449
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,900
because we were getting used
to the convenience

450
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,980
of having cold water
whenever you wanted it.

451
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,860
So then we had to get
reusable water bottles.

452
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,140
Otherwise known as fuckin' bottles.

453
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,740
They're all reusable.

454
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,580
When was the last time
you had a bottle in this hand,

455
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,020
the lid in this hand, you're like,

456
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,340
"These two things can never be
reunited ever again.

457
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,700
It's a plastic bottle.

458
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,220
If we put it in landfill,
it'll be there for a thousand years."

459
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,060
That sounds like a very durable,
reusable water bottle!

460
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,780
You know what a water bottle is.

461
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,220
It's a cup with a neck and a lid.
That's all it is.

462
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,740
You should take that water bottle,
cut off the neck,

463
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
don't bevel the edges.

464
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,340
Next time you have a drink
you'll fuckin' glass yourself.

465
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,900
And you deserve it
'cause of your stupid fuckin' bottle.

466
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,700
It's like KeepCups. "Gotta get a KeepCup.

467
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,100
I've gotta get a KeepCup."

468
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,580
All cups are fuckin' KeepCups!
All of them!

469
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,140
When was the last time
you had a cup of tea and you went,

470
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,660
"Oh, that's that."

471
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,380
You have a glass of water.

472
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,340
"Oh, yeah, fuck it!"

473
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,380
All cups are KeepCups.

474
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,380
You know how much we like keeping them?

475
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,780
We keep them in the cupboard.

476
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,260
It was named after the fuckin' cup!

477
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,540
It's a cupboard.
It's a boarding house for cups.

478
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,660
We love keeping our cups so much,
we provided accommodation

479
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,500
for our cups inside our accommodation.

480
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,260
You haven't invented a KeepCup.

481
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,220
You've invented a lid,
that's all you've done.

482
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:01,300
You know what a KeepCup is?
It's just a cup with your hand on top.

483
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,460
This is a KeepCup.

484
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,860
"Gotta get myself a KeepCup."

485
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,100
I still drink straight out of the tap.

486
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,700
I don't care.

487
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,900
"You beauty."

488
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,300
If I'm walking down the street
and I get thirsty,

489
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,020
I will jump into your front yard

490
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,460
and I will drink straight from your tap.

491
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,860
"Thank you."

492
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,540
Should do it at a bar here.

493
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,140
Jump the bar, rip into a craft beer...

494
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,300
"I'm just trying to save the environment."

495
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,300
To be fair, there would be a guy
there with a beard going,

496
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,780
"Yeah, fair enough, man, cool.

497
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,900
Sounds reasonable to me."

498
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,420
I found out I've got high blood pressure.

499
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,380
Yeah, I do. And I was not
pleased with myself.

500
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,900
I didn't fit with my impression
of myself.

501
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,020
I thought I was relaxed.

502
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,100
Doctor said,
"You got high blood pressure."

503
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,380
And she said,

504
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,580
"You're gonna have to cut down
on your drinking,

505
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,860
and you're gonna have
to start to exercise more."

506
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,700
I was, like, "All right. Or else, what?"

507
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,980
She said, "Well, then we'll have
to put you on medication."

508
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,460
I said, "All right.
Let's just jump to that.

509
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,420
I could spend three months
pretending to improve,

510
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,580
but then I'll be right back here
talking to you.

511
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,500
There's a pharmacy next door,
isn't there?

512
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,260
Write me five repeats. I never wanna
see your fucking face ever again.

513
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,220
Let's do this. I've got some work to do
in those other areas."

514
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,580
She actually said to me,

515
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,380
"You gotta try new ways to relax.

516
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,180
You've gotta find new ways to relax.
You should try meditation."

517
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,540
I was like, "All right,
well, how do I do that?"

518
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,580
She said, "Oh, there's an app for that."

519
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,220
I got prescribed an app.

520
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,260
I said, "Is there any there
that you recommend?"

521
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,140
She said, "Oh, just go to the app store
and type in 'meditation.'"

522
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,700
I was like, "All right.
Did you learn that at uni?"

523
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,380
So I went home,

524
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,620
and I got my app,
and I typed in "meditation,"

525
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,300
and I found one that I liked,

526
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,020
and I subscribed. So to do that,
you gotta enter your email address

527
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,860
and you gotta think
of a, you know, password.

528
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,100
You gotta enter your credit card details
because it's a three-month free trial,

529
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,700
then, after that,
it lapses into a subscription.

530
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,100
You have to opt out, not opt in.

531
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,300
So I put in my credit card,
I can remember that,

532
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,700
and then I put in the expiry,
I can remember...

533
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,500
Oh, the CVC number. Fuck.

534
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,620
Anyway, gotta find my wallet.
I find my wallet,

535
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,060
get the CVC number, type that in.
And then while I'm doing that,

536
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,780
I realize I haven't
updated my apps for a while.

537
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,620
There's that red circle of shame
with a nine in the middle of it.

538
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,660
I'm like, "Oh."

539
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,420
So long as I'm here,
I might as well update my apps.

540
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,380
Then I bump the home button,
they all start to fuckin' wobble.

541
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,220
It's like they're mocking me
for not knowing how to use my phone.

542
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,620
Then I realized I haven't updated
the software on the entire phone,

543
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,940
so I think, "Well, I should do that."

544
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,140
But you can only do that if your phone
is plugged into the wall and on the wi-fi,

545
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,180
but when I plug my phone into the wall,
I can't reach the wi-fi,

546
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,660
and I'm like, "Fuckin'...
How come I can't fix this?"

547
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,180
I get my phone, I'm like, "Fuck it!"

548
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,180
My heart's going brrr.

549
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,020
I can't get to sleep for five hours.

550
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,500
Get my heart pills and water bottle.

551
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,980
"Oh, this meditation is stressful.

552
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,940
Better stop doing it before it kills me."

553
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
So, yeah.

554
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,580
I'm 45.

555
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,860
I feel like I come from another time.

556
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:08,860
You know what I mean?

557
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,380
I look like I come from another time,
don't you reckon?

558
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:15,180
I look like a black-and-white photo
that has been colored in.

559
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,580
Don't you reckon you can imagine me

560
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,620
just leaning on a shovel
during the Gold Rush?

561
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,260
Just looking disappointed
'cause I couldn't find any gold.

562
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,860
I am from another time.
I grew up in the country in the '80s,

563
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,420
which is like growing up in the '50s.

564
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,220
So I have memories I shouldn't have.
You know what I mean?

565
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:47,140
Like at my... I'm 45, and I've memories
that don't belong in my lifetime.

566
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,380
Like, growing up,
my phone number, it was 26.

567
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,780
That was it.

568
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,860
It was really hard to think
of a false phone number, you know.

569
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,980
You're like, "Oh, yeah, our number is 67."

570
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,060
They'd be like,
"No, it isn't. That's Ed's."

571
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,300
I had a friend
whose phone number was 1.

572
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,220
How much fun could you have
with a phone number 1?

573
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,860
You're like, you moved into a new place,
everyone's like, "What's your new number?"

574
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,460
You're like,
"I haven't written it down yet.

575
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,980
"I haven't learned it. No, here it is.

576
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,580
Sorry, I've got it,
Here, you ready? You got a pen?

577
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,660
Are you ready?

578
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,580
1.

579
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,780
Did you get it? I can read it again.

580
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,940
I'll read it slower.

581
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,220
1."

582
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,820
This is how I used to ring home
from the city.

583
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,500
I used to ring 0176, reverse charges,

584
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:50,380
and then I'd say to the operator,
"I need you to dial 0674432,

585
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,660
and then you have to ask for 26,
all right?"

586
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,580
And even then,
they'd be like, "Ask for 26?"

587
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,460
I'd be like, "Trust me, it's...

588
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,900
It's the end of the line

589
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,660
and it's still got a manual
telephone exchange.

590
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,980
Just trust me.
You'll have to ask for 26."

591
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,940
And they're like, "OK, all right."

592
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
"Hello."

593
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,620
Tambar Springs Telephone Exchange."

594
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:27,180
"Uh, hi there. I have a Tom Gleeson here,

595
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,540
and he wants to be connected
through to, I believe, uh, 26."

596
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,180
"Oh, yeah, Jim.

597
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:39,180
Yeah, that will be right. Uh, all right."

598
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,620
"Um, yeah, it's a Tom Gleeson
wanting to talk to a Jim Gleeson.

599
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,860
And, uh, I believe
he will accept the charges."

600
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
"All right.

601
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,700
Uh, just a sec.

602
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,500
Uh, all right.

603
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,180
OK, uh...

604
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,340
What was I doing?

605
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,860
All right, here we go. Um, all right.

606
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,660
Uh, OK, here we go.

607
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,340
All right, keep your hair on.

608
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,660
OK, all right. Here we go."

609
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,460
Then I'd hear the weird static noise.
It'd be like...

610
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,780
"Hello?"

611
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,060
"Oh, g'day, Jim.

612
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,300
Got one of your boys on the line.

613
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,020
Oh, yeah, I think it's Tom.

614
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,700
And he wants to know,
will you accept the charges?

615
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
So I need to ask you, Jim...

616
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,420
Will you accept the charges

617
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,620
from a Tom Gleeson?"

618
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,020
"Uh, yeah, all right. Put him through."

619
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,660
"All right.

620
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,300
Putting you through."

621
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,700
OK, putting you through."

622
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,540
And then I'd be like, "Hi, Dad."

623
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,820
"Oh, g'day, mate."

624
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,220
"I'll see you on Sunday."

625
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,860
"All right." And hang up.

626
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,060
I am from another time.

627
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:28,460
I... I have memories
I shouldn't have at my age, like...

628
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,580
My grandfather was born in 1895.

629
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,940
It's not right, is it?
I shouldn't be 45 and...

630
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,540
One of my grandparents
was born in the 1800s.

631
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,300
Like, I didn't know him.
Like, he died when I was one.

632
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,340
And I was named after him,
and I always liked that.

633
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,220
He was a politician.
His name was Thomas Patrick Gleeson.

634
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,780
And l liked being named after him
and I put meaning into it.

635
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,660
You know what I mean?
I thought, "Oh, he's a politician.

636
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,820
Maybe that's why I'm good
at public speaking.

637
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,940
You know, he's a politician, maybe that's
why I'm good at being full of shit."

638
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,980
Anyway, I looked him up
and the most famous thing

639
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,900
that happened to him in his career

640
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
was he got booted out
of the Labor Party, right?

641
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:11,300
He got booted out of the Labor Party
'cause the Labor Party in New South Wales

642
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,380
wanted to abolish the Upper House
and he was in the Upper House,

643
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,980
so he disagreed.

644
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:20,900
Because when it came
to preserving his privileges,

645
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,020
he was very passionate about that cause.

646
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,980
So him and seven others,
they crossed the floor,

647
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,020
and they were known
as the Labor Independents,

648
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,060
and they held the balance of power
for 25 years.

649
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,140
So he learned that the biggest thing
that he could ever achieve in politics

650
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,700
was gained by self-interest.

651
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,340
And I thought, "Oh, wow!

652
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,420
I work in show business.

653
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,420
I'm into self-interest as well."

654
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,660
Anyway, I had all of this sort of
swimming around in my head

655
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,020
when I went to do a show in Nelson Bay,
in New South Wales.

656
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,860
And backstage, there was a letter
waiting for me.

657
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:01,220
And on the letter, all it said was...
It just said, "private."

658
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,820
I opened it up and it said, "Dear Tom,

659
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,940
I'm really looking forward
to seeing your show tonight.

660
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,340
But I'm even more excited

661
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,820
about meeting a first cousin
that I've never met."

662
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,980
And I was like...

663
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,180
"This person's full of shit."

664
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,780
I've met all my cousins.
You know what I mean?

665
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,140
There's heaps of them, but I've met them.

666
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,820
You know, there's Ed 67...

667
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,380
Damien 54, Kate 23.
There are heaps, but I know all of them.

668
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,780
So I'm like, "This person's full of shit."

669
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,420
Anyway, I kept reading the letter.

670
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:43,500
And it said, "I am also a grandchild
of Thomas Patrick Gleeson,

671
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,540
albeit from the wrong side
of the blanket."

672
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,300
And I was like, "This is the most
exciting thing that's happened to me

673
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:00,100
since I was looking for two dollars
in my kid's shit!"

674
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,780
But I kept reading, and it said,

675
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,060
"My mother never met her father,

676
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:12,660
or any of her brothers and sisters,

677
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,940
because she was 'trained'
not to make contact.

678
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,900
Anyway, I hope I enjoy the show.
Hopefully I can meet you afterwards

679
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,980
I didn't want to embarrass you, I just
wanted to meet you and make contact.

680
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,340
Yours sincerely, Debra."

681
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,380
So I rang me younger brother...

682
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,140
And I'm like, "Bro,

683
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,860
you know, Debra?

684
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,500
Well, it turns out she's our cousin."

685
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,180
Because I did a bit of research
into my grandfather,

686
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,620
and it turns out,
before he was a politician,

687
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,540
he was a mailman.

688
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,460
Turns out he's putting his package
in more than one fucking box!

689
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,940
He was the Barnaby Joyce
of the olden days.

690
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,420
I'd been named after a mad rooter!

691
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,940
And I said, "To be honest,
I'm a little bit disappointed, you know,

692
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,420
"because it's really taken the shine
off being named after him.

693
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:34,180
Because no one should have
to keep their life a secret.

694
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,660
No one should have to be ashamed
of their very existence."

695
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,860
My brother goes, "Yeah.

696
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,420
I still think she rooted on your jacket.

697
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,900
You can't take that away from me, bro."

698
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,700
Now he calls me jacket "Cousin Debbie."

699
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,580
"Ah, you're wearing Cousin Debbie,
are you, bro?

700
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:07,020
Good to keep it in the family."

701
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,780
I wanna show you something.

702
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,100
I took this from the ABC.
It was on a noticeboard.

703
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,820
Near the...
Near the lifts.

704
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,380
And it's a sign.
Maybe you've got things like this

705
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,020
in your workplace, I don't know.

706
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,940
I just feel like I need to air this,

707
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,860
so I can get over it.

708
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,460
It says,

709
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,980
"You're in a body positive zone."

710
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,420
"You're in a body positive zone."

711
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,900
Now, I've been at the ABC for a while.

712
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,820
There aren't many bodies there
to feel positive about, just quietly.

713
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,340
And I include myself in that.

714
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:49,060
"You are in a body positive zone.
Please refrain from the following.

715
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,660
No diet or weight talk."

716
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,620
That's pretty hard, isn't it?

717
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,380
In your workplace. Like, how can you
live under that regime?

718
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,060
You know, you're like,
"I'm feeling a bit bloated."

719
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,220
"Get out."

720
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,060
"Oh, I might've put on a few kilos
over Christmas."

721
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,100
"Get the fuck out of here, buddy.

722
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:12,380
Pack your bags, hand in your lanyard,
and fuck off, mate.

723
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:14,660
We're trying to be positive here,
get fucked."

724
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,660
"No body policing."

725
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:25,940
In brackets, "criticizing appearances."

726
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,660
Ah-ah.

727
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:31,780
I don't know what body policing is.

728
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,340
That makes me feel like
there are actual police, you know.

729
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,980
"Here we go, we're pulling people over
for random fugly check. Get over here.

730
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,660
Come here. You're fuckin' ugly.
Get off the road.

731
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,540
You're ruining everyone's day

732
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,660
with your fucked up face.
Get the fuck off the road."

733
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,820
There'll be undercover...
Undercover body police.

734
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:55,980
"Oh, you're fuckin' ugly." Anyhow...

735
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,260
"No body policing."
In brackets, "criticizing appearances."

736
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,420
This is in a TV studio.

737
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,020
You're not allowed to criticize
appearances. It's a visual medium.

738
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,540
Like it's... How would you go
if you're a makeup artist?

739
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,900
You know, you're like, "Oh, yeah, well,
it's what's inside that counts.

740
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:23,900
If I could put foundation on your liver,
I would, but, you know, here we are.

741
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:28,300
By the way, makeup, the "up" is not
a value judgement by the way, it's just...

742
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,020
I'd like to call it
the make down department.

743
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,980
No, no, sorry,
the make sideways department

744
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,020
'cause we are all beautiful.
We're all equally beautiful.

745
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,660
No one's ugly, no one's beautiful,
we're all the same."

746
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,940
"No food shaming."

747
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,060
In brackets, "judging food options
or eating habits."

748
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,740
At the ABC,

749
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,620
you could cause more stress

750
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,340
walking in with a fucking donut,

751
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,260
than walking in with a live hand grenade.

752
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,020
Know what I mean? If you walked in
with a live hand grenade,

753
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,900
everyone would be like,
"Thank God, it's just a live hand grenade.

754
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,740
Someone will explode but at least
they'll have good self-esteem,

755
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:16,100
and we know what to say."

756
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,900
Someone walks in with a donut...

757
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,260
Everyone just runs to the exits.

758
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,300
"What do we say? We don't know.

759
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,460
You've made a very healthy food choice.

760
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,100
And everybody agrees with you.
Oh, I said 'body'! Shit."

761
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,860
"No health or concern trolling."

762
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:41,860
In brackets,
"Keep your health advice to yourself."

763
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,300
I hadn't heard of that. "Concern
trolling." Have you heard of that?

764
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,860
I hadn't heard of that.
I had to look it up.

765
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,740
I think in the olden days
we used to call it "empathy."

766
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,620
But now...
This is what I don't like about the sign.

767
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,340
I think this is the crux
of the whole thing.

768
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,140
It presumes people
are passive-aggressive all the time.

769
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,380
Do you know what I mean?
Like if someone says...

770
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,660
Like, if someone's worried...
If someone asks about, "Oh, how are you?"

771
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,420
They're havin' a dig at you.
"Oh, you look well.

772
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,580
If you know what I mean."
Like it's... Like...

773
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,620
Like, R U OK? Day would be
a nightmare at ABC.

774
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,780
"Are you OK?" "I'm not fat."

775
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,220
"I wasn't saying that."

776
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,220
I just genuinely want to know,
"Are you OK?"

777
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,380
"I'm gonna kill myself!"
"This has been very counterproductive."

778
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,660
"Keep your health advice to yourself"?

779
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:35,620
"Oh, you got a bit of a sniffle, do you?
Oh, you should have some orange juice.

780
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,140
Get some Vitamin C into you."

781
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,060
Pack your bags, hand in your pass,
get the fuck out of the building, mate.

782
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,500
You and your virus avoiding ways."

783
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,260
Uh, the last one is my favorite.

784
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,260
Um, "no gender policing."

785
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,020
In brackets, "reinforcing gender norms."

786
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,060
No.

787
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,820
This is serious, OK?

788
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,740
"Not allowed to reinforce gender norms."

789
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,260
Norm's a man's name, by the way.

790
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,780
That's a side issue.

791
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,380
"Not allowed to reinforce gender norms."

792
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,780
"I'm just gonna go and do a piss
out of my cock. Sorry, urethra!

793
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,940
Almost presumed a cock
was a man's. Sorry.

794
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,980
I'm gonna do a piss out of my hole.
Can we agree on a hole?

795
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,340
We're all good with hole.

796
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,220
Everyone's got a hole.
Everyone got a hole, we can relax.

797
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:41,100
I'm gonna do a piss out of my hole, OK?

798
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:43,260
I don't want anyone
commenting on my holes,

799
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,420
weight, appearance or health, OK?

800
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,900
Don't troll my hole, OK?
Don't concern troll my hole.

801
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,380
This is a no-hole-trolling
workplace, OK?

802
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,940
Remember we learned the song?

803
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,780
♪ Don't troll my hole
don't troll my... ♪♪

804
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,500
We've got a big sign, mate.

805
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,980
It says 'no hole trolling.'

806
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:04,540
We took out the O's
'cause we were worried

807
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,220
that people would think
we were mocking their holes,

808
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:09,340
so it actually just says 'n hle trllng.'

809
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,220
But I think it's very clear
what it means.

810
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,980
N hle trllng."

811
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,820
Anyway, Marie Kondo said
if something doesn't bring you joy,

812
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,260
you should get rid of it, so I have.

813
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,540
I don't know how we're gonna survive.

814
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,220
I don't know if you've been
to my shows before,

815
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,020
but I always invite the audience
to tell me what they didn't believe.

816
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:42,900
Um, so this show tonight is 78% true.

817
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,700
There's a heavy load of lies.

818
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,260
Heavy load.

819
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,820
So if there's anything you didn't believe,

820
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,100
just yell it out
and I'll correct the record.

821
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,420
-  Debra.
-  Debbie.

822
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,300
Slow down. Debra.
What about Debra didn't you believe?

823
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,500
Debra's not a first cousin.

824
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:59,860
Debra's not my first cousin.
Yeah, that was a lie. Yeah.

825
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,380
Yeah, sorry, the heart of the show
is a lie, sorry about that.

826
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,060
Well, I'm doing a special for Amazon,
I just wanted it to all wrap up,

827
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,140
and I wanted it, "Oh, well,
it all worked out in the end."

828
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,660
But it didn't.

829
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,020
They're two true stories.
They're just not linked in any way.

830
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,540
They're just two different people,
but I just linked them together

831
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,580
'cause I just thought... 'Cause, you know,

832
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,380
Debra took my jacket,
it's a fucking mystery.

833
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,100
And you're, "Oh, well, that makes sense.
Maybe she just wanted to make contact.

834
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,140
Oh, it all wrapped up."

835
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:31,060
That's not how real life works.

836
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,340
It's full of loose ends
and now you've got my problem.

837
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,140
You also have no idea
why Debra took my fuckin' jacket!

838
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,540
Every day I walk down the street
and I go, "What the fuck was that about?"

839
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,460
I still don't know.

840
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,220
But both stories are true,
they just don't link.

841
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,100
The only common character is me.

842
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,780
Well, the story about the jacket,
I changed it slightly,

843
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,020
just ever so slightly, like, a bit, but...

844
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,020
It's true, but, like, remember when I rang
my brother and remember he said,

845
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,060
"I think she's a fan and she'd laid out
the leather jacket on the floor

846
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,380
and she'd fucked on it"?
He didn't say that, I said that.

847
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,700
I'm a comedian,
I come up with funny shit, so...

848
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:13,180
He just runs a café
in regional New South Wales,

849
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:16,180
so I thought he needed
more character development,

850
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,700
so I gave him a good line.

851
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,860
But I'm a comedian,
I come up with shit like that.

852
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,700
I just thought it'd be weird
if I rang him up and I'm like,

853
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,940
"And then I said this,
and then I said that,"

854
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:27,980
and my brother's just like,
" Good one, bro." So...

855
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,180
Actually, he said that "I reckon that
the man put on the leather jacket,

856
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,620
pretended to be you and rooted her."

857
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,220
That was his line, fair and square.

858
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,140
But then I said,
"Yeah, Debbie Does Jacket."

859
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,420
'Cause I'm a comedian,
and I come up with fucking jokes.

860
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,940
But I thought it was beneath my standards,
so I shipped it off to my brother.

861
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,460
It's a dated reference, it's a pun.
I thought, "No, he can..."

862
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,020
It's the kind of joke you'd forgive
a regional barista, you know what I mean?

863
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,940
In Orange, New South Wales.
"I'll have a latte. Thanks anyway."

864
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,900
"Debbie Does Jacket." "Yeah, go
fuck yourself." "Thanks, mate." But...

865
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,820
Shipped out the line to me younger bro.

866
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,260
Is there anything else you didn't believe?

867
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,500
The gold coin.

868
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,620
What, the... What... Gold coin.
What didn't you believe about it?

869
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,260
I just don't know
about your son...

870
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,980
You don't know about my son.
What are you saying about my fuckin' son?

871
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,980
I do believe in your son, yes I do

872
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,180
but I'm just trying to work out

873
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,900
whether he actually swallowed
the two dollar coin.

874
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,180
You don't believe... You don't know
if he actually swallowed it.

875
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,700
No, he didn't. And that was the point
of the whole story.

876
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,180
That was the twist at the end.

877
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,380
He had never swallowed it.
It's what makes it funny.

878
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,420
I'm really happy we had this chat,

879
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
'cause you would've been
walking around in the foyer, lost,

880
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,300
"That's a really weird long story about
his son swallowing a two dollar coin,

881
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,620
and then getting it out the other end.
So what?"

882
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,100
The twist was it was never in there!

883
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:57,060
But you know what? I did change
the story slightly, though, to be fair.

884
00:51:57,140 --> 00:51:59,140
Like, at the beginning,
I remember he said,

885
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,500
"I swallowed two dollar coin,"

886
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,420
and I just believed him straightaway.
I didn't believe him straightaway.

887
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:06,020
I was already a bit sussed,
but I wanted to throw you off

888
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,580
where the story was going, 'cause I didn't
want people to guess where it was going.

889
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,340
Turns out, even when I told you
where it was going,

890
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,620
you didn't notice, but...

891
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:18,620
I was trying to cater
to the smarter end of the spectrum.

892
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,580
But...

893
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,500
My son, I just...

894
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:28,220
He's got the clear blue eyes
of a serial killer, you know what I mean?

895
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,540
So I'm like, "Have you swallowed
a two dollar coin?"

896
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,500
He's like, "Yes."

897
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,820
I'm like, "You sure?" "Yes."

898
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,700
"Are you lying?" "Yeah... No."

899
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,620
And he... To be fair, I think
what actually happened

900
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:46,900
was I hadn't paid attention to him in
probably two weeks or something like that.

901
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,100
If I'm honest. I was just busy
doing other stuff, right?

902
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,540
And, uh... And he just
out of nowhere goes,

903
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,900
"Dad, I swallowed a two dollar coin."
And I was like, "What?"

904
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,060
And he was like, "Oh.

905
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,620
This resembles love."

906
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:10,660
And he knew if he had two dollars in him,
we're best buddies, but...

907
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:12,820
But if he didn't, we weren't,

908
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:14,620
so he thought,
"I just gotta keep it in here."

909
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,420
I kept the colander, too,
for those that are curious.

910
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:23,380
It's all right. I kept it,
kept the colander.

911
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:26,020
And, uh, I just put it in the dishwasher.

912
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:32,060
It's fine. What are you worried about?
Like, it's like...

913
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,460
You know, in a hospital, you know,
after they operate on someone,

914
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,460
they take the instruments
and then they put it in an autoclave.

915
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:39,540
And that's just high-pressure steam
in a box.

916
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,820
And, um, so that's what a dishwasher is.

917
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,020
And also, you forget.

918
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,540
I've kept it for when I'm cooking dinner
for people I don't like.

919
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,820
Anything else you didn't believe.

920
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,740
Going on holiday.

921
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,660
What was that?

922
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,860
You weren't really going on holiday.

923
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,660
The... In the whole show,

924
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:03,460
the part that you struggled to understand
was that I went overseas on a holiday.

925
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,900
You just can't comprehend that.

926
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,380
Is that really it? Why is that so...

927
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,940
Look, go to the airport, there are
hundreds of thousands of Australians

928
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:15,660
leaving every day.
I was one of those ones.

929
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,420
You felt that I made that up? "Oh, my God,

930
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,460
fuckin' hell, I've got
to think of a premise here.

931
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,060
What is something that would
never happen to a wealthy white man?

932
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,220
I went overseas." I mean...

933
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,340
Anything else
you didn't believe from a more...

934
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,380
That the best honey prawns
are from Dubbo.

935
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:38,540
Oh, no, have you been to Dubbo
and had the honey prawns?

936
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:42,620
You've no idea, they're delicious.
They're very, very, very solid.

937
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,540
Anyway...

938
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,660
Oh, you know what, actually, I said
me kids misbehaved at the restaurant.

939
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:48,580
That was a lie.

940
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,020
I was just... I just thought it was funny,

941
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,460
so you could relate to the show.

942
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:54,940
You're like, "Oh, wow,
his kids misbehave like our kids."

943
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:56,980
But I'm very wealthy.
We eat out all the time.

944
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,660
They're very well-behaved.

945
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:03,460
They both got passports, mate.

946
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,620
So I've let my children down.

947
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,940
They're very well-behaved
at the restaurant.

948
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,100
What else didn't you believe?

949
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,100
The ABC poster.

950
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,140
The ABC poster. No, that happened.

951
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,780
I'm really... Yeah, that... Yeah.

952
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,180
But it's not there now
because it's in my back pocket.

953
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,060
It's a bit far-fetched.

954
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,460
It's a bit far-fetched?

955
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:25,940
I know, that's why I brought it in
and wanted to discuss it.

956
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,220
What would you... Would you prefer
I just brought in a fire drill?

957
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,380
Did you? I'll be like,

958
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,300
"Look at this sign.

959
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,060
It says when there's a fire,
you have to leave the building."

960
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,620
And you'd be like, "I love this routine
'cause I know exactly what's happening.

961
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,300
Beginning, middle and an end
with no tangents!"

962
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,540
The Queensland police.

963
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:54,100
- What's that?
- The Queensland police.

964
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,060
Oh, the Queensland police.
That absolutely happened.

965
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,500
If anything, it was worse.

966
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:02,060
Um, he didn't end up fining me.

967
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,100
At the very end...
It took 15 minutes, OK?

968
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,940
Fifteen minutes of him doing this
and then he got to the very...

969
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,220
And the entire audience had left.

970
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,180
They'd all left. There was no one left.

971
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,260
It was just him and me.
And he gets to the end,

972
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,700
and he goes, "All right.

973
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:15,940
I'm gonna let you off with a warning."

974
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,020
Not as a joke, like, for real.

975
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,620
"I'm gonna let you off with a warning."

976
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:25,060
Then he said, "You know what
really upset me, Tom, about this?"

977
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:27,620
I'm like, "No." He goes,

978
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,740
"That you weren't contrite.

979
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,420
You didn't show any contrition."

980
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,140
And I thought,
"Fuckin' hell, you can't spell 'Tom'

981
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,780
and that comes out of your vocab."

982
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,740
That really threw me.

983
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,340
Like, I can never play Scrabble
with this guy.

984
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:47,300
Just out of nowhere... "Contrition."

985
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,300
You'd be like, "Fuckin' hell."

986
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:54,340
Everything else, hat, cat, mat,
then "contrition." Fuckin' hell.

987
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,060
I said, "Well, of course,
I didn't show any contrition.

988
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:01,340
It's 'cause I don't give a shit.
I'm a man. I'm 45."

989
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,900
I said, "I'm gonna jaywalk again,
I'll be honest with you.

990
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:06,580
I'm gonna do it again tonight.
See just up there?

991
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,300
I'm gonna do it there.

992
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:10,700
You should follow me.
I'm gonna do it again.

993
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,540
Have you got payWave?
I'll pay in advance.

994
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,460
Let's do it. Follow me."

995
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:22,420
All right, I should finish up the show,
so I do wanna take a brief moment

996
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,260
to say thank you so much
for coming and seeing

997
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,860
the final performance of this show.

998
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,100
I do really appreciate it.
Thank you very much.

999
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:31,300
Um, like I said, the two stories
at the heart of the show,

1000
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,060
they're both true,
but they're not related in any way.

1001
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,380
Um, there was Debra, who took my jacket.

1002
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:38,420
Where it is,

1003
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,740
I've still got it, but it's a mystery
as to why she did it.

1004
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,660
But then the other story
is about my cousin,

1005
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,700
and I did meet her backstage,
and it was lovely.

1006
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,420
And we had a nice chat.

1007
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,220
And now she's caught up
with all the family.

1008
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:55,540
Now they're all getting together
without me even being there.

1009
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,340
And it was an absolute pleasure
to meet her. Her name's Joy.

1010
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,100
I named the show after her.

1011
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,300
- Ah, that's a lie. Her name's Helen.

1012
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,180
Thanks so much. That's it.

1013
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:11,980
Thank you.

1014
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:14,900
Thank you very much.

1015
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,860
Thank you. Oh, oh. Thank you.

1016
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,380
That's lovely. Thank you very much.

1017
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,660
Thank you.

1018
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,020
All right, this, um...

1019
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,980
This is my favorite story,
and it's 100% true.

1020
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,060
OK? So...

1021
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:09,060
It's 100% true, OK?
This happened to me a long time ago.

1022
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:12,340
Two of my friends scared my other friends
that were camping, and it went too far.

1023
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,660
And it was just too much, OK?

1024
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,980
Like, it was bad.

1025
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,740
We'd finished high school.
And this is how it started.

1026
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,340
I was with my two mates,
Chris and Marshall,

1027
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,180
we're just having a few beers
and we're like,

1028
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,660
"Our friends are camping.

1029
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,380
"It's not too far away.

1030
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,300
"It's only, like, 45 minutes' drive.

1031
00:59:42,740 --> 00:59:43,860
"We got the car.

1032
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,580
We could drive out there.

1033
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:48,420
Imagine that.

1034
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,260
No, no, no, no, I'm serious.

1035
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:58,700
I'm saying, imagine...
Imagine if we drove out there tonight.

1036
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,900
Like, just drive out there.
'Cause think about it.

1037
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:04,500
They've been out there
for like a week, camping.

1038
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:07,180
You know, just out
in the middle of nowhere.

1039
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,780
And then imagine
if we just walked out of the trees.

1040
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:12,180
Like, 'Hey!

1041
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,860
We're here!

1042
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,820
How are you?

1043
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,820
Would you like a cold beer?

1044
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,700
Would you like a... No, you wouldn't
like a cold beer, would you?

1045
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:21,940
'Cause you're camping.

1046
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,820
You're using your survival skills.

1047
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:27,740
To have a cold beer from a fridge

1048
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:29,980
wouldn't quite be
in the spirit of it, would it?

1049
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,260
Would you like some pizza?
We even have pizza.'

1050
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,820
'Oh, no, no, you enjoy your burned damper

1051
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,980
and your fuckin' coffee out of a tube.'"

1052
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,260
'Cause think about it.

1053
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,500
They've been out there for ages.

1054
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,380
Like, they're not even
thinking about us tonight.

1055
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,260
They're just out
in the middle of nowhere.

1056
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,220
They would have no idea
that we're coming.

1057
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,820
They would have no idea
that we're coming.

1058
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:04,660
We could dress up.

1059
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,500
We could dress up in clothes
that they have never seen before.

1060
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:15,900
We could put on some of that weird shit
in the bottom of your dad's wardrobe.

1061
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,220
That'd be cool."

1062
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:19,300
Now at this point I thought,
"You know what? I'm not going."

1063
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,220
I'm not gonna go, 'cause this is
the kind of night where someone dies.

1064
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,780
And it's gonna be me, I can feel it,
so I am not gonna go.

1065
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:29,100
And I knew I had made
the right decision straightaway,

1066
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:31,340
'cause my two friends,
when they're getting dressed up,

1067
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:32,620
they were getting too into it.

1068
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:34,940
You know what I mean?
They're getting too into it.

1069
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:38,300
Like my friend Chris,
like, he put on, like,

1070
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:40,660
full body overalls, right?

1071
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:42,580
King Gee overalls, full body.

1072
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,380
He was paranoid that you can
recognize someone by their hands,

1073
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:47,180
so he put on gardening gloves.

1074
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,500
On his head, he put on a balaclava.

1075
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,460
And on top of that,
he put a tweed flatcap.

1076
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,020
Like, already you could base
five horror films on that guy.

1077
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:05,540
Now, that's a franchise, right there,
just fuckin' good to go.

1078
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:08,580
And then my other mate, Marshall,

1079
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,420
he was wearing, like, denim jeans
and a denim jacket.

1080
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,300
On his hands he had
pink washing up gloves.

1081
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:20,220
Balaclava. On top of the balaclava,
he had a hunting cap

1082
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,700
with the flaps folded down.

1083
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:25,140
Now, it was summer, so that's commitment.

1084
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,340
Now, my mate Chris,

1085
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:34,700
he had an ax!

1086
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:45,380
And my mate Marshall,
he had a mining pick!

1087
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:49,260
But it was a little one
for taking geological samples with.

1088
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,060
Which, I don't know why,
I always found that more menacing.

1089
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,060
You know what I mean?

1090
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,540
If you saw someone just coming at you
with a giant pick,

1091
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:59,180
you'd be, like, you'd be just,
you'd like...

1092
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:03,460
But if someone comes running at you
with a tiny fucking specimen...

1093
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:05,580
You'd just, what are they gonna do?

1094
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,380
Just chisel away at your patella
for a bit?

1095
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,700
So they go out there.
I don't go out there.

1096
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,940
They go out there,
and I know what happened

1097
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:23,060
because hours and hours
and hours and hours later,

1098
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:24,860
Chris comes back to tell me all about it.

1099
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,140
He comes into my loungeroom,

1100
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,700
I was just watching Rage,
passing the time, right?

1101
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,020
He just comes in, he's like...

1102
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,580
"It went well.

1103
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,420
All right? I can tell you that much.
It went well.

1104
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,900
Oh, mate, we found 'em straightaway, too.

1105
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:45,340
We found... 'Cause they camp
where we always camp, you know?

1106
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,860
Near that big box tree, near the creek?

1107
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,900
They were there.
We found them straightaway.

1108
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,700
But we didn't just run straight in there.

1109
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,380
Oh, no, we're not stupid.
If we had run straight in there...

1110
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,660
We spent over an hour stalking them
in the undergrowth.

1111
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:04,300
We would just pace our way around,

1112
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:07,180
and then every now and then, we'd just
pick up a stick and then snap it.

1113
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,180
We'd really settle in, too,
'cause we knew that

1114
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,580
we could see them,
but they couldn't see us.

1115
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,100
Then we'd get a little reaction.

1116
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:29,300
And then we'd spend a whole half an hour
just pacing our way,

1117
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,900
around the other side of the campsite,

1118
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:34,820
so that they'll think
that they were surrounded,

1119
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,420
by more than two people.

1120
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,660
We'd just settle in,

1121
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:44,940
pick up another stick,

1122
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:46,940
and then snap it.

1123
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,060
Now, I knew it was going well
'cause they started to use

1124
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:59,820
that voice that you use when
you're trying to let other people know

1125
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,220
that you're not scared.

1126
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,300
They're like, 'Oh,

1127
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,780
can you hear that noise?

1128
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:09,060
Those sticks snapping?

1129
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:11,100
Yeah, we're not scared.

1130
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:15,340
If you can hear us,
which we don't think you can,

1131
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,420
'cause we don't think anyone's there.

1132
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:20,580
We know that things

1133
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,900
sound larger than they are
in the dead of night.

1134
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,980
It's probably just a possum
or something, so we are not scared.

1135
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,900
If you can hear us,
which we do not think you can,

1136
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,580
because we don't think you exist.

1137
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,180
You're probably just a possum.'

1138
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,540
So my mate Chris, he said,

1139
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:49,660
"I got my ax, and I started
to scrape it on a tree."

1140
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:59,860
'Cause he said it made
a kind of a metal-on-wood noise.

1141
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:01,660
Zing!

1142
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:03,660
Zing!

1143
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,380
Zing!

1144
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:07,780
It made a metal-on-wood noise.

1145
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,180
The kind of noise
that could only be made by a human.

1146
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,380
That doesn't sound like a fuckin' possum.

1147
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,660
Zing!

1148
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,460
Zing!

1149
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,940
And he said it went well.

1150
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,700
"Can you hear that noise?

1151
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:27,580
Of metal on wood?

1152
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:30,660
We're not scared.

1153
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,460
Could be anything.

1154
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,340
It's probably just a kangaroo
with a machete,

1155
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:42,020
or a koala with a teaspoon.
I don't know what it is!

1156
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,580
But we are not scared.

1157
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,860
So if you're out there,
which we do not think you are,

1158
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,220
we wanna let you know
that we've got a shotgun.

1159
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:54,660
Oh, yeah.

1160
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:58,580
We've got a shotgun in my mother's Volvo.

1161
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,060
And if you come in here...

1162
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:06,540
We all know karate.

1163
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:12,900
We know karate.

1164
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,660
And if you come in here
and fuck with us...

1165
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,260
We're gonna take you down...

1166
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,500
Oh, God.

1167
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,860
Who are you?

1168
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:33,540
What do you want from us?"

1169
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:41,420
So my mate Chris said,

1170
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:45,580
"It was going so well, I didn't
wanna leave this thing half-done.

1171
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:50,020
It was turning into my masterwork,

1172
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:53,380
and I wanted to put
a little cherry on top

1173
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:55,220
just to finish it off."

1174
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:00,580
So he said. "You have to remember,
out there, it was pin drop silence.

1175
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,860
So quiet." He said it was so quiet,
you could hear a gum leaf break.

1176
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:10,220
He said it was so quiet,
you could hear a green gum leaf break.

1177
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,700
And he said,
"Out of that silence, I did this."

1178
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:45,420
He said...

1179
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:48,620
He said, "I did a blood-curdling scream."

1180
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,780
He said it like that to me,
like he was really proud of himself.

1181
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,540
"I did a blood-curdling scream, Tom."

1182
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,820
I said, "I know,
you're telling me this story

1183
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,780
in my lounge room with the lights on,
and I just shat meself.

1184
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:01,980
What were you doing out there?"

1185
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,300
He said, "It went well."

1186
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,460
He said, "I knew it was
going well straightaway

1187
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:11,660
'cause the tent that they were staying in
just started to change shape."

1188
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,020
"So," he said, "we ran in there.
We charged them."

1189
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:30,420
He said they were so scared, they all went
to jump into the Volvo to drive off,

1190
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,940
one of my mates,
they just left him behind.

1191
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,460
They wrote him off!

1192
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,620
They're like, "He will not make it.

1193
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:38,260
We'll just tell his mother
he went missing.

1194
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,740
He just wandered off into the bush

1195
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:42,100
like Miranda in fucking
Picnic at Hanging Rock.

1196
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,180
He's gone.
We will never speak of him again."

1197
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,980
They all went to jump into the car,
Chris said he went to grab

1198
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:50,540
one of them by the ankle,
went to pull him out.

1199
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,900
He was so scared,
he couldn't talk anymore.

1200
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,660
He was moving his mouth,
but nothing was coming out.

1201
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:57,940
He was just going...

1202
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:06,460
Chris said he went all loose in his hands
like he was just waiting to die.

1203
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,220
He just lost the will to live.
He was just like...

1204
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,180
He said he was like a cow in an abattoir.
He was just like,

1205
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,380
"Oh, fuck it. Just kill me."

1206
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:17,060
He started to poke him with his finger
and he just let him do it.

1207
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,860
"Uh, oh, fuck it."

1208
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:30,620
So they take off their balaclavas.

1209
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:32,940
"Surprise!

1210
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:35,420
Look, it's us!

1211
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,260
Your friends.

1212
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,060
That was pretty funny, wasn't it?

1213
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:46,740
Why aren't you laughing?
What's going on? Why are you all...

1214
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,380
Why are you in the fetal position?
Come on.

1215
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,900
It was just a joke."

1216
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,340
So Chris said they stayed there
for a while and they...

1217
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:04,060
He said he... That they laughed/counseled
them about it.

1218
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:11,020
And me and my mates,
it's our favorite story.

1219
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:15,220
It's one of those stories that always
comes out, too, you know what I mean?

1220
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,780
Whenever we're together,
it's always late at night,

1221
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,060
the story gets told again.

1222
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,460
"Oh, you forgot the bit about..."

1223
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:26,940
"Oh, what about... You forgot..."

1224
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,940
"Oh, you didn't say that, he said that.
And then he said that, and you said that."

1225
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:32,380
"No, no, no, I said that."

1226
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,780
And it always devolves

1227
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,020
and it always ends the same way.

1228
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:41,540
With that guy going,

1229
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,460
"But then you left me behind.

1230
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:56,620
"I'm not gonna come to these parties
again if you keep telling this story.

1231
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:58,780
You left me behind.
I don't like this story.

1232
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:00,780
Fuck you guys.

1233
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,660
And stop calling me Miranda."

1234
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,460
Thanks so much for coming along.
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

1235
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,420
Thank you.

1236
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,660
Thank you.

1237
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:18,180
Thank you.

1238
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:19,940
Thank you.
