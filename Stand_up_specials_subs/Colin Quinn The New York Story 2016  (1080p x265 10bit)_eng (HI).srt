24

If you want exuberance--
This is a New York show. It’s not--

25
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:37,467
Exuberance is the West Coast.
That’s my whole point.

26
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:41,134
Applause is killin’ this city.
Understand me?

27
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,371
The West Coast--
exuberant, enthusiastic people--

28
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:47,667
That’s what they’re supposed to be,
’cause it’s paradise on earth.

29
00:01:47,734 --> 00:01:49,701
So they’re happy and enthusiastic,

30
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,778
perpetually surprised
by everything that goes on.

31
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:55,148
Oh. “The mountains, the beach.” Ah.

32
00:01:55,234 --> 00:01:56,868
Everything they do,
they’ve done it a hundred times.

33
00:01:56,934 --> 00:02:00,200
It’s like the first time.
“You wanna go to the store?” “Yeah!”

34
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:04,467
Midwest-- Humble, hard workin’.
They had to farm.

35
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:06,501
So they got that personality.

36
00:02:06,567 --> 00:02:09,801
The South. Very hot. Very polite.

37
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,000
Overly polite because, you know,

38
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:14,367
could get a little violent
if you’re not careful.

39
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,901
I don’t know about you,
but I got a concealed carry permit myself.

40
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,777
New England, it’s like they’re always
gettin’ hit by mist from the water.

41
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:27,748
New York is New York.
We’re what everybody says we are.

42
00:02:27,834 --> 00:02:30,667
Rude, opinionated, pushy,

43
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:34,421
loud, fast-talking, sarcastic, wiseass.

44
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,556
But what people don’t understand is,

45
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:40,627
what’s rude to the rest of the country
is polite to us and vice versa.

46
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:44,400
Because, if I go to a pizza place,
and like, “Gimme a slice.”

47
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:47,167
-That’s polite. Because...
-[laughter]

48
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:49,067
...you’re not tryin’ to hold the line.

49
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,304
There’s a line.
You’re not tryin’ to slow--

50
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,434
If you go into a pizza place like,
“Hi, how are you? You must be hot.”

51
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:57,367
That’s rude. You know what I’m sayin’?

52
00:02:57,411 --> 00:03:01,248
There's no stools.
They want you to walk and eat your food.

53
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:03,300
You have to fold your food and walk.

54
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,534
I remember once, when I was little kid,
we went to Maine.

55
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:10,167
On, like, a family vacation to Maine.

56
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:13,234
We go to the general store.
I wanted to kill myself in five minutes.

57
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,601
I was like-- You walk in, the guy’s like,
“Oh, haven’t seen you around.”

58
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,934
Sir, who cares? Gimme my--

59
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,472
What do you care? Give me my soda.

60
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:27,407
“You... visiting?”

61
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:30,911
“No, I live here. I’m just very shy.
It’s my first day out of the house.”

62
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,549
“You new in town?” “No, I’m the mayor.
I just got elected actually.”

63
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:38,234
But, um, yeah.

64
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,321
New York, it’s always like somebody’s
hurrying you somehow.

65
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,724
It’s just a rushed kind of vibe.

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,127
But the thing is
it's a pedestrian city too.

67
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,334
It’s a city for walkers, not cars.

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,467
That’s why you’ll notice
every car acts like a person,

69
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,469
and every person acts like a car.

70
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,267
Pedestrians are in charge.
They walk like they--

71
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:01,634
You’ve seen it a hundred times. They
walk in the street, the cars just stop.

72
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,411
The driver’s like, “Ooh, I almost got hit
by that person. That was close.”

73
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,200
It’s just a rushed and hurried thing.

74
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,334
Even as a kid, in church:
“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.”

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,934
“Yeah, yeah, yeah. We know.
Come on. Hurry up.”

76
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,367
Yeah, the New York personality, that’s us.

77
00:04:19,434 --> 00:04:24,267
So where-- Why did
the New York personality form?

78
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:28,801
How did all these cultures come together
to make the New York attitude?

79
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:32,300
Well, first of all, you have to realize,
all the people that came here

80
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:35,208
came here ’cause they were miserable
wherever they were.

81
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,133
So now, you know, you got a city filled
with miserable people, to begin with.

82
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:49,656
The first people were Lenape Indians.
The first people on Manhattan.

83
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:53,593
That’s according to them.
You’re takin’ their word, which is...

84
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,330
You know, they said they were first,
but what are you gonna do?

85
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Say,
“We killed the people here before us”?

86
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:02,767
Of course you’re gonna say
you were the first. And, um...

87
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,039
But let’s just assume they were
the first people here.

88
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:10,434
Already, they had an attitude
to the other tribal people

89
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,901
’cause they had all the seafood.

90
00:05:11,968 --> 00:05:14,634
This was headquarters for all the seafood.
All the waterways.

91
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:19,400
Give ’em five bushels of clams,
give us 40 cartons of American Spirits.

92
00:05:19,467 --> 00:05:22,467
You know--
Give ’em some beads, but get outta here.

93
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,467
Canarsies are like, “Don’t push me.”
Canarsie Indians.

94
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,929
And Ramapough comin’ in from Jersey
on the weekend for some seafood.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
And...

96
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:33,567
The Lenapes were kinda-- They smoked.

97
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,734
The only place to get tobacco
in the whole world was North America.

98
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:41,367
They invented smoking.
Already a New York vibe. They’re smoking.

99
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:43,133
Standin’ up there.

100
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,100
Henry Hudson sees them standing there,
lookin’ at him over the cliffs.

101
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:48,849
Northern Manhattan. Lookin’ at him.

102
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,384
Smokin’, shirtless. A little homoerotic.

103
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:53,153
You’re not imagining that.

104
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:57,567
It’s kind of like--
Right away, it’s not a friendly--

105
00:05:57,634 --> 00:06:01,968
When you think of the Dutch comin’--
The Dutch-- pot, prostitution, Amsterdam.

106
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,129
This is not those Dutch.

107
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:07,934
This is, like, 1600s Dutch.
Everywhere they go, they take it.

108
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:11,404
And they show up with the navy,
so it’s already not--

109
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,701
When you showed up with the navy,
that was a statement back then.

110
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:16,367
’Cause there’s only four navies
in the whole world.

111
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,434
And the Lenape Indians don’t have a navy.

112
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,968
Their navies are a couple
of strong swimmers, a couple of canoes.

113
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,487
So when Holland’s like,
“This is a beautiful place you got here.”

114
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,501
“Oh. Here it comes.
It’s not for sale. It’s not for sale.”

115
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:35,534
“I didn’t say if it was for sale. I’m just
sayin’ it’s beautiful. How about $26?”

116
00:06:36,033 --> 00:06:37,601
They’re like, “No.” “Twenty-five.”

117
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,834
“The guy doesn’t understand-- No.”
“How about 24?”

118
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,670
We better say yes.
’Cause it’s gonna get lower than 24 soon.

119
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:46,234
The Dutch just took it.
They branded in those--

120
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,642
All those names are Dutch names.

121
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,478
“Bronx” is a Dutch word.
“Harlem,” Dutch word.

122
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,547
“Bushwick,” Dutch word.
“Brooklyn” is a Dutch word.

123
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:57,751
“Stoop,” Dutch word.
“Yankees” is a Dutch word.

124
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:00,520
The word “fuck” is a Dutch word.
I swear to God.

125
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:03,667
So if you see anyone
on a stoop in Brooklyn going,

126
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,734
“Fucking Yankees,” they’re speaking Dutch.

127
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,529
So. Now, you know...

128
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,702
You know, it’s true.
It’s true as anything. Right?

129
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,801
Um... It’s New York.

130
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:21,634
So now you got the smoking.
You got people saying “fuck.”

131
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:24,934
You’re starting to get a formation
of a New York personality.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,234
The surface, you know. But still...

133
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,534
But you still don’t have
that attitude that we all--

134
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:32,634
Everybody from New York thinks
they’re better than everybody else.

135
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,234
Everybody, we think we’re smarter.

136
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,634
Not just rich people.
Poor people, middle-class--

137
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:41,334
This is the only city
that has blue-collar snobs. You know.

138
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:47,067
Take somebody, two years of high school,
put ’em in a room with MIT professors,

139
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,302
after an hour, you’re like,
“What’d you think of them?”

140
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:52,172
“They’re not New York. They don’t”...
You know.

141
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,477
“They’re-- They’re educated.
I give ’em that. You know.

142
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,400
They’re smart, but they don’t get it.
They got their head up their ass.

143
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:03,834
No common sense, you know.”

144
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,852
Yeah, we just think-- We go on vacation.

145
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:08,968
Everybody else goes on vacation to say,
“Can you imagine if we lived here?”

146
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:11,858
We go on vacation to tell people, “Can
you imagine if you lived in New York?”

147
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:18,565
What do you do? “Give me a slice
of the pizza. That’s not New York pizza.”

148
00:08:19,601 --> 00:08:21,200
The guy’s like, “I know. It’s Italy.”

149
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:24,400
“I don’t give a shit what it is.
It’s not New York pizza.”

150
00:08:24,467 --> 00:08:27,467
“Gimme that bagel. That’s not
a New York bagel. You don’t know...

151
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,177
You have the wrong water.”
We tell people they have the wrong water.

152
00:08:34,033 --> 00:08:36,601
It’s not like we live in Minnesota
with beautiful lakes.

153
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,152
It’s our water.
We act like, “Oh, this is the water.”

154
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:43,400
But you still don’t have
the psychological-- the attitude.

155
00:08:43,467 --> 00:08:47,067
The superior attitude that we all--
That came from the British, you know.

156
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:49,596
’Cause the British showed up,
and the British in those days,

157
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:52,298
they showed up, it was theirs.
Nobody even fought.

158
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,634
They’re just, like, “You know the drill.
It’s the British Empire.”

159
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,200
They brought the real navy.

160
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,072
They had the Royal Navy,
the biggest navy in the world.

161
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,542
Peter Stuyvesant is walkin’ around.
Looks in the harbor one day.

162
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,167
With his wooden leg, you know.

163
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,480
He just turns to his Dutch friends
and speaks in Dutch,

164
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,217
“We’re fucked. You understand me?”
I don’t know.

165
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,300
And the British were like, “You can keep
the names of the towns. They’re quaint.

166
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:19,601
But lose the shoes.”
They’re the British Empire.

167
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,734
“Get rid of the windmills, please.”

168
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:24,601
“What are you calling it, by the way?”
“New Amsterdam.”

169
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:29,100
’Cause the Dutch named it after their most
prized possession. Amsterdam is beautiful.

170
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,272
The British rename it
after the sixth shittiest city

171
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:33,573
in Northern England.

172
00:09:34,734 --> 00:09:36,701
York was always a shithole.

173
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,878
Like, we should have been named
New London, right?

174
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,848
But there already was
a New London, Connecticut.

175
00:09:41,934 --> 00:09:44,067
But if you’ve been to New London,
Connecticut, you realize

176
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:47,153
they should be called New York,
and we should be called New London.

177
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,434
So the British ran it, like I said,

178
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:53,634
all those Protestant churches
in Lower Manhattan were Brit--

179
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:56,334
And they just ruled, you know,
British style.

180
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,000
And they ran until-- Revolutionary War,
this was still British headquarters.

181
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:03,167
Manhattan was British headquarters
throughout the Revolutionary War.

182
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:08,133
So all the-- Nathan Hale hung to death
on 66th Street and 3rd Avenue,

183
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,477
where there’s now a Starbucks,
of course, on the corner.

184
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:13,234
That doesn’t say at all--

185
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,601
That ruins the glamour of their death,
you know, the martyr.

186
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:20,753
“I regret I have but one life to lose
for your reduced-fat raspberry scone

187
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,623
and your caramel macchiato.”
You know.

188
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,625
So the British ran it.
Finally, they’re out.

189
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:28,167
Then it became the transshipment point.

190
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,897
All kinds of stuff,
but smaller groups of people.

191
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:34,467
There was no main group until the Germans.

192
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:39,639
Germans came in in the early 1800s,
and they brought that German personality,

193
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,334
which is still a part of us.

194
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,000
First of all, they brought
the delicatessen, which is a German word.

195
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,801
And it’s the German personality
that’s still here today,

196
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,317
where the customer’s not always right.
They yell at you. They hurry you.

197
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,267
They bully you. Efficiency over humanity.

198
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,956
“Come on. What do you want?
While we’re young. Let’s go.

199
00:10:57,023 --> 00:11:00,326
What do you want? You don’t know?
Get over there.” We’re still--

200
00:11:02,033 --> 00:11:03,868
We’re still the only city
that has two lines.

201
00:11:03,934 --> 00:11:07,300
One’s for people that know what they want.
One’s for people who don’t.

202
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,000
And if you get on--

203
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,743
If you get on the line that doesn’t
know what they want, you never get back.

204
00:11:16,834 --> 00:11:18,000
It’s impossible.

205
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:22,448
Yeah, and that German personality
is still there. The abrupt, rude-polite.

206
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,851
Where people,
like, people from out of town--

207
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:27,487
They ask directions. They’re smiling.
You’re giving them information.

208
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:30,290
“Excuse me. Where’s the museum?”
“Excuse me. Where’s the subway?”

209
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,292
People from New York accuse you
of information.

210
00:11:32,367 --> 00:11:33,734
Like you owe them the information.

211
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,829
They don’t say, “Excuse me,” just block
you. “Where’d you get the ice cream?”

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,835
You’re like, “Holy shit.”

213
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:47,601
Then if you tell ’em, they want a review.
“Over there.” “Is it good?”

214
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,013
If you say it’s good, you have to leave,
or they might come back.

215
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,282
“Where’s that guy
that said this was good?”

216
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,754
Yeah, that abrupt, accusatory, Germanic,
you know.

217
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,690
But most of them left.

218
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,200
There’s still some Germans...
in Ridgewood,

219
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:10,033
compulsively washing
their stoops right now.

220
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,066
For the most part,

221
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,503
they moved to Pennsylvania, Ohio,
'cause they wanted order, symmetry.

222
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:20,400
The city had no symmetry.
All the streets are, like, on top--

223
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,634
It was just back-- It was--
Shantytowns on top of sh--

224
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,701
The water was so polluted,
people had to drink grog.

225
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:28,734
They couldn’t even drink water.
Have to drink beer instead of water.

226
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:31,951
Who’s gonna move there?
The Irish. Yeah. Irish people.

227
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:35,267
The Irish came
and they brought the wiseass.

228
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:37,457
When people say, “Why do you talk out
of the side of your mouth?”

229
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:40,167
That came from the Irish people.
’Cause that’s an Irish quality

230
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,029
from trying not to get slapped in church,
they talk out the side of their mouth.

231
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:48,167
’Cause we came here,
and we were cynical to begin with.

232
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,470
And we're cynical we got here
’cause there’s no Statue of Liberty yet.

233
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:54,367
There was never that poetic moment
that the Italians and Jews had.

234
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:58,601
The Italians came. They see New York City.
They’re already cryin’, emotional.

235
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:04,133
And then they look up, and welcoming them
is a hundred-foot mother.

236
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,100
You know? They’re like, “Oh, Mama.”

237
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,133
-So...
-[applause]

238
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,567
They’re like-- [speaks Italian]

239
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:13,534
[mock Italian]

240
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:15,834
The Jews were like,
“Look at this. It’s beautiful.

241
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,367
The quality’s not necessarily...

242
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,067
It’s obviously copper. It’s not bronze.

243
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,200
But, uh... They’re welcoming you.
That’s the important thing.

244
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,540
The message they’re trying
to get across comes across.”

245
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,109
Irish showed up.
It was the same docks they just left.

246
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,467
[Irish accent] “Look at this fuckin’--

247
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:34,614
Streets are paved with gold?
They’re paved with shite.”

248
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:38,734
Yeah. We just did what every group did.
We brought our history

249
00:13:38,785 --> 00:13:41,154
and put that onto it to make sense to us.

250
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,156
So we brought it.
We made it into parishes.

251
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,334
’Cause parishes make sense to us.

252
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:49,529
And a parish is just, you know,
a church, some Irish people and a bar.

253
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,531
Basically.

254
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:55,335
The bar and the church are very similar.
There’s a lot of stained glass in both.

255
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:59,038
A lot of kneeling going on.
There used to be a lot of smoke.

256
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,574
You’re waiting for the one person to tell
you, “The mass has ended. Go in peace.”

257
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:05,244
Or, “Hey, you don’t have to go home,
but you can’t stay here.”

258
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,167
And, yeah, that’s what happened.
The Irish showed up, went to the church.

259
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,850
“What should we do, Father?”
“You go to the bar.

260
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:13,219
Tell them I sent you, and they’ll
set you up with you a job.”

261
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,801
That was Tammany Hall,
basically, in a nutshell.

262
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,901
The church was the Internet,
bartender was the search engine

263
00:14:18,968 --> 00:14:22,067
and whatever Web site he sent you to,
that was your job.

264
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,597
You didn’t turn it down. They were
all Irish Catholic jobs of course.

265
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,333
Because they’re like,
“We need a thousand carpenters.”

266
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,267
If you turned it down: “Are you too good
to do what Joseph and Jesus did?”

267
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,738
“No, okay. I’ll take it.”

268
00:14:32,501 --> 00:14:34,534
The fire department started in 1845.

269
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,734
They said, “We need guys
that are willing to run into flames

270
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,912
and drag souls out
of the torments of hell,

271
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,167
and then sit around, 12 of you,
and have supper together every night.”

272
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,488
They’re like, “I’ve seen that picture
my whole life. I’d love to do it.”

273
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:53,526
The police department
started the same time.

274
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,863
They said, “We need you to find people,
drag ’em to a small, dark room,

275
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:58,701
smack ’em into confession...

276
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:01,701
until they absolve themselves
of punishment.”

277
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,071
They’re like, “They did that to me
my whole life. I’ll do that to people.”

278
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,767
When people say,
“Why were all the New York cops Irish?”

279
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:11,344
’Cause the police academy
was Catholic school.

280
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,601
Nobody likes to admit it,
but a good cop should have

281
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:20,887
the listening skills of a good bartender
and the unpredictable violence of a nun.

282
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,122
-Now... So...
-[applause]

283
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:25,992
The Irish...

284
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,868
There’s still an Irish vibe.

285
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:33,868
Like, you can tell when
you compliment somebody from New York,

286
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,235
the Irish influence.
You're like, “Nice haircut.

287
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,303
They're like, “Fuck you,
what’s wrong with it?”

288
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,071
You're like, "No."

289
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,340
“I said it was nice.”
“I know what you meant.”

290
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:45,278
So the Irish ran New York
for about 40 years.

291
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,033
Then 1880, the Jews show up.

292
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,033
[groans]

293
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:51,984
And... I think it’s safe to say most

294
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,388
of the Jews have not physically recovered
from their boat trip.

295
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,267
They’re still...

296
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,060
Somethin’ about that boat. They’re still
kind of seasick if you talk to them.

297
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:04,100
It’s genetically passed down
over the generations.

298
00:16:04,167 --> 00:16:07,701
A little nauseous. “How was the trip?”
“It was hot. That’s how it was.”

299
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,467
The Jews were the only immigrant group

300
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:13,634
that wanted to be checked
for tuberculosis at Ellis Island.

301
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,467
Every other group’s like,

302
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:20,501
“Don’t let ’em touch me
with a stethoscope. They’ll send me home.”

303
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:23,734
The Jews are like, “Excuse me.
You missed this whole section.

304
00:16:23,801 --> 00:16:26,634
I’m wondering why.
You’re supposed to be a doctor.”

305
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:29,033
They love their doctor.

306
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,334
They came and they worked
the sweatshops when they came over.

307
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,634
They had to work--
All the sweatshops were all Jews.

308
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:38,698
They were the earliest union organizers.
They started all the unions.

309
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:41,467
’Cause I guarantee
somebody must have said,

310
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:45,304
“We need volunteers to complain
about conditions. Is there any--"

311
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,711
Every hand shot up. “I was gonna
do it anyway. Make it official.”

312
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:53,412
And...

313
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,081
The Jews don’t even consider it complaint.

314
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,000
They’re just inquiring
why you would do it that way

315
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,767
when there might be an alternative.

316
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:00,434
’Cause they...

317
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:03,567
They came here to not talk.
Remember, they’re like, “Don’t talk.”

318
00:17:03,634 --> 00:17:05,701
The pogroms of Europe traumatized--

319
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:08,300
But after a couple of months,
it drove them crazy.

320
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:12,033
“I just wanna ask one question.
If they tell me to shut up, I’ll shut up.”

321
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,000
And they looked around, you know.

322
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,167
“We’re not gonna get civil servant jobs.
The Irish have those locked down.”

323
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:21,033
What about what doesn’t exist?
What about those abandoned buildings?

324
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,868
They saved their money
from the sweatshops.

325
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:26,100
Show up, Department of Buildings,
Irish civil servant.

326
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:29,701
Nobody’s asked him a question
in 12 years. He loves his job.

327
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:32,734
He’ll take a three-hour liquid lunch
whenever he feels like it.

328
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,167
Then, these two cultures never met.

329
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,122
The Jewish guy’s like, “Excuse me.
I'm wondering about--

330
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,625
We want to buy the abandoned building.”

331
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:41,968
He’s like,
“That’s the city’s. It’s not for sale.”

332
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:45,100
So, other people just walk away.
Irish people are like, “Oh.”

333
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,466
“Just curious.
When you say that's the city, is that you?

334
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,534
Is there somebody I should talk to?”

335
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:54,267
The Irish guy’s like, “Pushy bastard.
Do you believe the pushy fuck?”

336
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,511
Irish guy tries to scare him. “Trust me.
You don’t want to deal with the city.

337
00:17:58,601 --> 00:18:02,267
Paperwork, inspectors, licenses,
Department of Sanitation,

338
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,950
Department of Health, permits.”

339
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,085
He thinks he’s scaring the guy.

340
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:09,121
He doesn’t realize
he’s turning him on right now.

341
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,901
The Jews aren’t scared of the paperwork.

342
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:16,801
Everybody else: “Get the paperwork
done quick. Just sign it.”

343
00:18:16,868 --> 00:18:19,601
The Jews are like, “Whoa, whoa.
Don’t rush me on this paperwork.

344
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,834
Now I am a little suspicious that you’re
trying to get me past this paperwork.

345
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:25,905
I want my nephew-- He’s an accountant.
I’d like him to look at it, too.”

346
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:30,234
That’s what the Jews did.
They came and they saw what didn’t--

347
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,434
“What about that?
What about the fish market?

348
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,715
You wanna be partners? "If you don’t,
tell me." “I’ll be in.” “I’m doin’ it.”

349
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:37,567
“What about the, uh, vaudeville?

350
00:18:37,634 --> 00:18:40,968
That’s puppet shows.
It’s fine for cowboys in Montana.

351
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:43,501
We’re supposed
to be civilized people here.” You know.

352
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:49,261
Cultural Center, Lincoln Center,
Carnegie Hall, City Center, all Jews.

353
00:18:49,334 --> 00:18:52,167
Not just the people that started.
I mean, look on the chairs.

354
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:54,601
“Melvin Tannenbaum.”

355
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:57,400
Even out here.
The Michael and Lenore Schimmel Center.

356
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:59,000
That’s where we are right now.

357
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,141
You know Lenore was like,
“You said we were gonna do the thea--"

358
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,943
“Okay, okay. I’ll do it.”

359
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:09,548
And the audience is all Jews
every night. Right now.

360
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:12,785
The whole audience... No, wait. Wait.

361
00:19:13,801 --> 00:19:16,634
Once in a while, a couple of young Asians.
Their cousin’s a cellist.

362
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:19,467
Otherwise, the whole audience are Jews.

363
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,234
So...

364
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:25,531
They like the culture, the intelligen--
The <i>New York Times.</i>

365
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:29,268
Eskimos have 30 words for snow.
Jews have twice that many for stupid.

366
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,868
“Schmuck, schmo, schlub, schmendrick.”

367
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:35,541
We could be here all day
on the sch’s alone.

368
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:42,000
And they brought that linguistic thing
that we still speak to this day.

369
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:45,300
All of us still speak that,
uh, art of complaint.

370
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:49,367
A minor inconvenience in apocalyptic
terminology came from the Jews.

371
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:51,968
Like, “How was traffic? Bad?” “Murder.”

372
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:59,033
“How’s the line in there?”
“A bloodbath. I’ll be honest with you.”

373
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:03,334
“You look hungry.”
“I’m starving to death.”

374
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,439
“I’m dying of thirst right now.”

375
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:09,308
“Are you uncomfortable?”
“I’m in agony. I’m not uncomfortable.”

376
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,148
So now you got this Irish
and Jewish kind of vibe goin’ on.

377
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,784
Then these Italians are comin’
ten years after that.

378
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,020
They came like everybody else,
where they’re like,

379
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,988
“Hey, where you goin’ tomorrow?”
“America.”

380
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,658
“Really? What part?”
“Maybe you’ve heard of it.

381
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:28,067
It’s called none of your fuckin’ business.

382
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:30,300
‘What part?’ Mind your business.”

383
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:31,764
And...

384
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,267
The Italians, they brought the volume.

385
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,968
Because the Irish and Jews were still,
in the house:

386
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:41,067
“Get in here.
I’m gonna fuckin’ talk to you.”

387
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,133
The Italians, no.

388
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,133
I’d be out playin’, my friend, Anthony--
Little kids.

389
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,834
His father would lean out the window.
“Anthony. Get in. Dinner.”

390
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:49,448
He’s like, “No, Dad.”
“No?” Shut the window.

391
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:53,119
We all knew what was gonna happen
except for Anthony. He’d be playin’.

392
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:54,854
You know. Every time.

393
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:59,567
His father’d come out. “You wanna play?
Let’s play. Let’s play for awhile.”

394
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,027
Beat him down the block.

395
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,033
Just beating him. Just knocking him
into every car on the block.

396
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,100
All the adults are watching.
Nobody would do anything.

397
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:11,968
There was no child abuse in those days.

398
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,142
People would be like,
“Hey, watch my antenna.” You know.

399
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,578
“Watch the mirror.”

400
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,882
Finally, Anthony’s laid out
like Jake LaMotta in <i>Raging Bull.</i>

401
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:24,601
[crying]

402
00:21:24,667 --> 00:21:28,634
His father starts cryin’.
“Anthony, look what you made me do!”

403
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:32,467
Anthony’s like, “I know, Dad.”
“What are you doin’ to me?”

404
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,927
Finally, kiss, hug, walk in. Make up.

405
00:21:34,968 --> 00:21:37,934
A mini opera just played out
before your eyes.

406
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:42,534
That’s the Italians. They’re operatic.
It’s good or bad, high or low.

407
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:45,868
There’s no in-between. There’s no,
“The guy’s passive aggressive.”

408
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,107
No. “He spit in my eye, basically.”

409
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:51,133
You’re either the nicest or the worst.

410
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,400
Either you’re the be--

411
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:55,781
I always use whatever’s
in the street as the example.

412
00:21:55,868 --> 00:21:59,267
“He’s the most honest--
You see them ants eatin’ that bread?

413
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,787
He wouldn’t take the bread from them
if he was starvin’ to death.

414
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,455
'cause it belongs to them."

415
00:22:04,901 --> 00:22:06,567
Or: “The biggest piece of shit.

416
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,362
He’d step over his mother’s body
for the love of a dollar. This fuckin'--”

417
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:13,868
And they always gotta have the cash out
to show you...

418
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,469
They’re very-- No wallet. No credit card.

419
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:20,739
Cash. “Fuck, this is what it is.”

420
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,211
They looked at it like a Sicilian village.
Like they invented their neighborhood.

421
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,848
I mean, they respected the parish
to a degree, I guess.

422
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:32,834
But at some point, they try to make
the priest a frontman for their bazaar.

423
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,322
“Hey, Father, we’re havin’ a thing
on Saturday down in the basement.

424
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:39,058
We need some foldin’ chairs.
But you don’t gotta be around.

425
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:41,994
Leave him alone, stupid.
He’s gotta get up Sunday mornin’.

426
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:45,701
He needs to get to bed early. Here’s a few
dollars for the collection. Take care.”

427
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,399
Everything’s the collection plate.

428
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,470
It’s a psychological thing
with them because, you know--

429
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:54,133
Milkman, give him a stick of butter.
Twenty bucks.

430
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,033
They’re not makin’ money off it.

431
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,133
They’re losing money.
Twenty bucks for a stick of butter.

432
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,868
It’s some psychological thing.

433
00:23:01,934 --> 00:23:04,501
They consider it, like,
“Take care of the guy.”

434
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,901
Take care. It’s money, but it’s--

435
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,734
Take care. Mailman, take care of him.

436
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,767
But then you have to reciprocate.

437
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:16,267
So, if the mailman takes the 20,
then he has to treat you a little special.

438
00:23:16,334 --> 00:23:20,534
He can’t throw your mail in the puddle
like every other jerk-off on the block.

439
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,767
He’ll ring the bell.
“I took care of your letters.”

440
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,834
“Thank you.” Know what I mean?

441
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,506
’Cause if he doesn’t do that,

442
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:30,400
then... enemy for life. Then, that’s it.

443
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,246
Thirty years he can work.
They’re like, “There’s that mailman.

444
00:23:34,313 --> 00:23:38,150
See how he likes deliverin’ letters with
broken fingers, this fuckin’ mailman.”

445
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,819
Never forgive.

446
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:44,390
That’s it. For the rest of your--
Guy’s lived on the block 40 years.

447
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,501
“Hey.
Hear the guy across the street died.”

448
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:49,228
“Yeah, he’s the one that stepped
on my wife’s foot.

449
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,297
What goes around comes around.

450
00:23:51,901 --> 00:23:54,234
Drunken Irish bastard that he was.”

451
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,601
“Hear the guy on the corner passed.
He suffered.”

452
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:59,972
“He’s the one who used to comb
his hair in the meat market. Let him rot.”

453
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,767
Yeah, always vendetta.
They like the vendetta.

454
00:24:04,834 --> 00:24:06,234
When there’s nobody to fight,
they turn on the son.

455
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,133
The son’s too big to fight now.
He’s grown up. He can’t fight him.

456
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,968
They’re heckling him, still trying
to embarrass him in front of the block.

457
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,767
Kid’s out washin’ the car.
He’s like, “Look at him, washin’ the car.

458
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:19,300
Can’t even wash his own ass yet,
this fuckin’ <i>ciuccio.</i>

459
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,133
You missed the right rear hubcap,
you fuckin’ meatball. Look at this kid.

460
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,834
Wash the car, fuckin’ jamoke over here.

461
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:29,501
Fuckin’ <i>ciuccio.</i>
Half a momo I got for a son.”

462
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:34,473
“Half a momo.” Which, I still--
I still don’t know what that is.

463
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:38,667
Half a momo-- If it’s half a mamaluke,
which is an idiot.

464
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:42,467
Or half a homosexual,
or some combination of a--

465
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,615
It doesn’t even matter.

466
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:47,019
'Cause the insult--
The fraction is the insult.

467
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,153
That--

468
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,324
It’s whatever they say about you,

469
00:24:52,391 --> 00:24:54,994
I’m sayin’ you’re half of that.
How do you like that?

470
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,531
They’re scared of shit that doesn’t scare
other people, not scared of shit that--

471
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,701
Come to the block beat up.
“Get the bats. We’re goin’ there now.

472
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:05,637
Everybody get the bats,
’cause we’re going.”

473
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:07,300
By the way, notice: “Get the bats.”

474
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:11,033
Not, “Get some bats,”
or, “Do you have any bats around?”

475
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,267
The bats. They’re already pre-positioned,
under the stoop.

476
00:25:14,334 --> 00:25:17,501
One’s behind the door.
One’s under the tree. On the curb.

477
00:25:17,567 --> 00:25:19,801
Back of the guy’s trunk.

478
00:25:22,534 --> 00:25:24,467
But they don’t like new things.

479
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:27,267
Like when ’70s yogurt started.

480
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:29,767
“Hey, try this.”
“What is that? What is that?”

481
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:33,634
“No, it’s yogurt.”
“Is it all right? Get the fuck out.

482
00:25:33,701 --> 00:25:35,868
Fuckin’ yogurts. Fuckin’ sick bastard.”

483
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:40,467
Yeah. When they like you,
you know they like you.

484
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:43,834
They kiss you, hug you, smack you
in the face. Punch you in the stomach.

485
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:45,501
When they don’t like you,
they don’t touch you.

486
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,146
They touch themselves.
Right down the body.

487
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,315
“He thinks-- Let’s see what’s goin’ on.

488
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,601
I don’t say nothin’ to nobody. [mutters]

489
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,267
<i>Che palle.</i>” The balls on the fuckin’--

490
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,389
[imitates spitting]

491
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:01,560
That was always the period. [spits]
When they spit.

492
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:04,863
Oh, they came, just about 1930.

493
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,598
Then the Puerto Ricans came
and brought the pace.

494
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:09,701
When I was a kid, I thought
Puerto Ricans were just speaking Spanish

495
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,334
because they speak so quickly.

496
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,033
But when you get to know Puerto Ricans,
you realize they don’t speak Spanish.

497
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,267
They only speak English...

498
00:26:15,901 --> 00:26:18,634
with a Spanish accent very quickly.
That’s New Yorican.

499
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,580
And they understand Spanish
'cause their parents speak it.

500
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,767
But they don’t speak a word of it, but...

501
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:24,968
The Puerto Ricans came.

502
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:27,133
In those days,
a Puerto Rican building on the corner--

503
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,334
Now, people would be horrified.

504
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,890
We used to give directions based
on ethnicity.

505
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:36,667
Make a lef-- Irish bar, the Greeks,
the Chinese laundry.

506
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:38,634
The Puerto Rican building on the corner.
Now people go,

507
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:41,300
“Whoa. How do you know
it’s a Puerto Rican building?”

508
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:43,434
“There are Puerto Ricans outside.”

509
00:26:43,934 --> 00:26:45,200
They say--

510
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:51,410
They say, “What if they’re not outside?”
“Don’t worry. They’re gonna be outside.”

511
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,601
The Puerto Ricans...

512
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:58,484
They brought the kind
of communal food festival,

513
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,719
kind of outside, inside,
no real distinction.

514
00:27:00,801 --> 00:27:02,367
Outside, inside.

515
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:05,324
The TV’s in the windowsill.
It’s half inside, half outside.

516
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:07,767
The old lady’s leaning.
Half her body’s there.

517
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,267
The music’s inside,
but it’s blasting outside.

518
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,999
They’re pulling a chair down on the rope
for the uncle to sit on outside.

519
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:18,470
The ironing board’s inside. It comes out.
Now it’s a card table. There’s a fluidity.

520
00:27:18,567 --> 00:27:21,567
All together all the time. Just social.

521
00:27:21,634 --> 00:27:25,200
Everybody. Multigenerational.
Little kids. Old people.

522
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,834
Everybody hangs out together.

523
00:27:26,901 --> 00:27:29,300
I never saw <i>one</i> Puerto Rican.
Just everybody together.

524
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,200
Goin’ up to the--

525
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:34,501
They’re goin’ up to the park
like a carnival atmosphere.

526
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:38,834
They got the radio, the grill.
They got ice and chicken on sticks.

527
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:42,734
The bandanas and the flags
and the little kids dancing.

528
00:27:42,801 --> 00:27:44,767
The old lady is dancin’.

529
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,834
They got the mix of Catholicism
and sexuality.

530
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,868
A lot of cleavage with a lot of crosses.

531
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,567
They got the little girl
in the Communion dress holdin’ hands

532
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,667
with the aunt in the halter top.

533
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,482
The cousin’s driving next to them.
Six saints on the dashboard,

534
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,651
decal of a naked woman,
right next to each other.

535
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,787
The door’s half open.
He’s half inside, half outside driving.

536
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,058
Yeah. It’s all a continuity with them,
know what I mean?

537
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,894
You go to their house. You think
you’re there as a guest for a party.

538
00:28:15,961 --> 00:28:18,197
They put you to work.
They give you assignments.

539
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,432
“Good. You’re here early. Check the stove.

540
00:28:20,501 --> 00:28:22,767
Then... go see what’s wrong with Grandpa.

541
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,567
He won’t leave the room.
We can’t get him out of the room.

542
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:29,801
Then walk the most frightening dog
you’ve ever met in your life.

543
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:37,767
Then change the baby. Change the baby.”
Always the baby.

544
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,567
Change the baby. The baby--
Always baby-- “She’s pregnant.

545
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,056
Her face is gettin’ fat.
I think her cheeks--"

546
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:49,400
People walk by. They’re like sonograms.
“Look, that’s a boy. She’s carryin’ high.”

547
00:28:50,467 --> 00:28:53,067
They heckle you if you have one kid.
“Where’s her brothers? Her sisters?

548
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,100
I don’t understand what’s goin’ on.”

549
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,834
The baby’s the star of the family.

550
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,437
By the time you’re eight,

551
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,405
in the Puerto Rican family,
you’re washed up. It's over.

552
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,876
Eighth birthday, you’re like,
“Hey, happy birthday.

553
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:07,479
Okay. Change the baby.”
It’s the circle of life.

554
00:29:08,714 --> 00:29:11,483
Then the black people came back
in the 1950s.

555
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,601
There were black people at the time
in Harlem, believe it or not.

556
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,033
There used to be black people in Harlem.
And...

557
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:21,000
I know it’s a shock. Listen to me.

558
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:26,968
1950s, black people came from down South.
Called the Great Migration.

559
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:30,267
Came from down South. So the black kids,
we’d meet ’em early ’60s.

560
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:33,234
And you could tell right away
they had a New York attitude.

561
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,434
First of all,
they would talk back to the adults.

562
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:39,234
They would talk to the adults
like they were the same age.

563
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,300
Store owner’d be chasing us.
He’s like, “I’ll tell your mother.”

564
00:29:42,367 --> 00:29:44,501
We’re like, “Oh, shit. Tell my mother?”

565
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:48,133
Black girl’s like, “Tell my mother.
I don’t care. Get my mother here.”

566
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,567
Talk back to the cops.
The cops would talk like black kids.

567
00:29:53,634 --> 00:29:56,200
And the black kids would talk like cops.
They’d reverse.

568
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:59,133
All the cops,
it’s, like, the late six-- ’71.

569
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,367
Like, “Oh, slick. My man, come here.
I wanna talk to you.

570
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,670
That’s right. I’m not jivin’ you.”

571
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,039
All the black kids
spoke police procedural.

572
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:11,200
“Nah, that’s a class-D misdemeanor.
He ain’t gonna get out of the car.

573
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:14,868
That’s a 522. Nah.

574
00:30:14,934 --> 00:30:17,868
No, that’s a Fugitive Task Force.
See his insignia?”

575
00:30:20,067 --> 00:30:22,234
When it’s cold--
“That’s the lieutenant. He don’t get out.

576
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,567
He make the sergeant go out.
It’s too cold.

577
00:30:24,634 --> 00:30:27,100
Yo, Sarge. They’re making you get out.”

578
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:30,601
And, um, talk back to the teachers?

579
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,064
We go to class.
Black girls come into class.

580
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,834
Eatin’ SweeTarts, six kinds of candy,
like they’re at the movies.

581
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,100
They come in with candy. They’re talkin’.

582
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:40,072
Teacher’s like,
“Sit down, Josephine. Be quiet.”

583
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:43,475
“Lincoln freed the slaves.
Don’t tell me to sit down.

584
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:46,178
I wasn’t talkin’ anyway.
I was done talkin’.

585
00:30:46,267 --> 00:30:48,067
I was tryin’ to listen.”

586
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,916
The black guys come in five minutes late.
The black guys come--

587
00:30:50,982 --> 00:30:54,453
When I came in late for class,
I’d adopt a posture of penance.

588
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,023
Like, “I know I’m late.”
I don’t wanna get called out.

589
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,627
Black guys come in like the Medicis comin’
to check on Michelangelo’s progress.

590
00:31:03,634 --> 00:31:04,901
Lookin’ around like...

591
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:13,234
No books, just a No. 2 pencil in the Afro,
like, you know...

592
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,834
If there’s a test, break it out,
borrow a piece of paper.

593
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:22,300
Heckling each other. They can’t let one
physical flaw go uncommented upon.

594
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,284
They walk into class heckling.
“Yo, he got old lady ears.” You know.

595
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,367
“She got a varicose neck right there.”

596
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,934
“Your glasses is fogged.
Better clean off your glasses.”

597
00:31:34,534 --> 00:31:38,667
“He live in the back of the hardware
store, come in smellin’ like cut keys.”

598
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:46,204
“Yo, your book bag is dusty.
His book bag. Get it off the floor.”

599
00:31:47,234 --> 00:31:50,334
“He wear the same shirt every Tuesday.
That’s your Tuesday shirt, right?”

600
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,133
Then the teacher’d go,
“Sit down, Antoine.”

601
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,234
“Tell him to stop wearin’ the same shirt,
and I’ll sit down. Shit.”

602
00:32:00,534 --> 00:32:03,334
Then they’d put themselves
in whatever the teacher was talkin’ about.

603
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,167
Sit there, like, “Shit, if I was Tesla,

604
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:08,501
I’d beat Thomas Edison’s ass
if he steal my idea.”

605
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,968
Then the girl leader would shut--
It would be, “Be quiet.”

606
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:17,367
“Don’t tell me to be quiet, bitch.”
In those days, they’re fightin’ words.

607
00:32:17,434 --> 00:32:20,400
“My brother’s gonna wait outside
and fuck you up at 3:00.”

608
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,767
And here’s the thing.
Her brother didn’t go to the school.

609
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:25,544
There’s no cell phone.
You couldn’t text anybody.

610
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,980
Somehow, at 3:00,
her brother’d be outside waitin’.

611
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:30,515
With, like, a...

612
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:35,987
The kid with muscles over a dashiki.
So he was a badass.

613
00:32:37,067 --> 00:32:39,767
But that girl was, like, the leader.
She’d get ’em all quiet.

614
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:43,667
“Shut up! Let the teacher teach.
Go ahead, teacher. Teach.”

615
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:47,432
She was just over it all, like...

616
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:50,068
Unless the teacher said something
they didn’t like. They’d all hiss.

617
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:53,100
“Then we became the land of the free.”
“Sss, land of the free.”

618
00:32:56,033 --> 00:33:00,267
Yeah. So that’s the original--
The people I was talking about till 1965.

619
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:02,534
Black, Puerto Rican, Italian, Jewish, I--

620
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:05,834
Like, that’s the original New York
personality till 1965, whatever.

621
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,267
And it’s opinionated, loud, pushy,

622
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:10,033
cynical, fast, you know--

623
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,167
And, of course, politically incorrect.
In those days, people spoke ethnically.

624
00:33:14,234 --> 00:33:15,501
A little, you know...

625
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:19,097
Obviously, it’s better today.
There’s a lot less racial tension now.

626
00:33:19,167 --> 00:33:22,033
-[loud laughter]
-But, what I’m saying...

627
00:33:24,936 --> 00:33:28,106
In those days,
the first thing people said was racial.

628
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,609
The first question they’d ask you--
“What are you?”

629
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,411
And you’d have to answer.

630
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:37,082
They’d ask your ethnicity first.
Forget about avoiding--

631
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:39,384
Now, try to get a white person
to say “black.”

632
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:42,387
“What race was he?”
They’re like, “Oh, God. Oh, shit.”

633
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:50,734
This is bad.

634
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:53,334
This is bad. This is bad, huh?

635
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,967
In those days people would go,
“What are you?”

636
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,403
You could only be four things
at that time.

637
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,539
Black, white, Puerto Rican or Chinese.
That was it.

638
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:03,133
If you tried to be something else,
people would dismiss it.

639
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,133
You’re like, “Well, I’m half Honduran
and half Filipino.”

640
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,033
“You can be Puerto Rican or Chinese.
So make a decision.”

641
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,619
In those days, first of all, prejudice
and racist, two different things.

642
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:17,067
Racist, systemic. Prejudice, individual.

643
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:20,167
Some people would be prejudiced,
but systemically, they were fair.

644
00:34:20,234 --> 00:34:23,000
The store owner would be,
“Hey, wait your turn. You’re not next.

645
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:26,200
Get in the back of the line.
The colored lady was next.” So...

646
00:34:27,033 --> 00:34:29,934
Individually, he was prejudiced.
Systemically, he was fair.

647
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,434
We had the black bus driver,
hated white people.

648
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:36,734
And, like I say, New York characters,
the point of those New York characters,

649
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:38,868
is that most of them are prejudiced.

650
00:34:38,934 --> 00:34:40,767
That’s part of the charm--

651
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,480
Nice people are very nice people.

652
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:46,117
Sincere, like I said.
They’re supposed to be sincere. Boring.

653
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,587
Not the most exciting people
you’re ever gonna meet.

654
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,155
You gotta have a little bit
of a crummy at--

655
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,223
We had a black bus driver,
hated white kids.

656
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,100
We rode public busses to school.
Sometimes you’d get him. You were excited.

657
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,930
Everybody on the bus liked it
'cause it was a little bit of a story

658
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,566
instead of the usual nice driver:
“Hi, come on on.”

659
00:35:01,634 --> 00:35:05,234
I’d get on, try to make my friends laugh,
pretend I couldn’t find my bus pass.

660
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,067
“Sir, I know I have it here somewhere.”

661
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:10,667
“You better have it. You ain’t gettin’
on this goddamn bus without it.

662
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:12,811
You white people run this country.

663
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,280
You don’t run this bus,
unfortunately for you.

664
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:18,300
I know you think you do, but you don’t.”
I’m like, “Sir, it’s here.”

665
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,419
“You little cracker, I know
what you’re doin’. I recognize you.”

666
00:35:22,067 --> 00:35:25,300
“Sir, it’s here.” “You goddamn devil.
Get in the back of the bus.”

667
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,901
And he’d be yelling, “White devils!
I know what you do!”

668
00:35:27,968 --> 00:35:29,434
Everyone’s like, “Whoa.” Laughin’.

669
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:31,501
It wasn’t a commission-forming
moment back then.

670
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:35,200
But now, even nonethnic thing--
People are very touchy.

671
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,203
The New York characters.
The obnoxious fan at the game.

672
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,472
You can tell they’re influenced
by society now.

673
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,273
“Hey, ump! You’re crazy!

674
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,243
No offense to anyone with mental illness
in their family, obviously.

675
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:49,414
Obviously, it’s a serious issue.
We need more funding for research.

676
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,451
Hey, ump! Why isn’t there more funding
for research for mental illness?”

677
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:57,889
Cranky old ladies. “Turn that music down,
you little bastards.

678
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:01,292
Unless it’s a legitimate form of social
protest, in which case, I understand.”

679
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:04,496
The construction workers-- girls walk by.

680
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,165
Now they’re like, “Whoa. Look
at that strong, independent woman.”

681
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,233
Nah.

682
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,772
I know girls are like, “Bullshit.
They still harass us.” Okay, fine, ladies.

683
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:18,367
Yeah, because all those pe--

684
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:22,167
It’s also the Internet, obviously,
took away a lot of New York characters.

685
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:24,367
Because, like, Yelp, perfect example.

686
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:29,567
Yelp was a person.
Now you read: “I didn’t like this place.”

687
00:36:29,634 --> 00:36:31,601
In those days, you wanted
to find out if the deli was good,

688
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,367
some guy was human Yelp.

689
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:38,868
He’d come in. “Gimme a sandwich.
Whoa. He’s not makin’ my sandwich anymore.

690
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:42,834
This kid, he’s stingy with the relish.
This little--

691
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:47,100
You make it.” Like he’s givin’ the guy
a treat. “You make it from now on.”

692
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:52,100
Directions, you know.

693
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:54,601
Now you got Google Maps, Waze. Five--

694
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:57,901
It’s dispassionate.
“Make a left. Go 500 feet.”

695
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:01,634
“Stop. Make a U-turn.” “Congratulations,
you’ve reached your destination.”

696
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:04,167
In the old days,
you had to find directions guy.

697
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,592
Every couple of blocks, there was a guy,
pretty effective, be out there.

698
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:09,260
Miserable. Didn’t get along with his wife.

699
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:12,167
So he was always standing outside,
waiting... for somebody.

700
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:17,067
You pull up. “Hey, this guy looks
like he knows where he”...

701
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:20,968
“Where you tryin’ to get to?”
He had to shame you. Part of the ritual.

702
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:26,467
You’re like, “The Van Wyck.”
“The Van Wyck?”

703
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,267
“How’d you get here if you’re tryin’
to get to the Van Wyck?”

704
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:38,601
You can’t even answer that question.

705
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:42,400
He starts tellin’ other people. “This
guy’s tryin’ to get to the Van Wyck.”

706
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,467
This guy’s not helpful. “Where’s he comin’
from?” What does that have to do with it?

707
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,901
“The Van Wyck.”
The whole block’s embarrassed.

708
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:53,371
Then he starts grandstanding
’cause he’s got you now.

709
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:57,041
The kids are in the back. “You kids okay
with this guy drivin’?” Shut up.

710
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,000
And, yeah. The difference was,
like I said, negativity.

711
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:04,667
That’s what makes humorous characters.

712
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:07,067
New York was supposed
to be a negative town.

713
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:09,767
A city of misery and complaint.
That’s the whole point.

714
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:13,424
And the positive people
were the psychopaths back then.

715
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:16,528
’Cause they just came out of some program.
You’d see them on the streets.

716
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,797
“How you doin’?”
“I’m doin’ great. How are you?”

717
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:23,635
I should’ve crossed the street.
I forgot this...

718
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:28,501
“I heard your girlfriend left you.”
“Blessing in disguise.” [groans]

719
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,067
“Heard you lost your job.”
“Best thing that ever happened to me.”

720
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,501
Oh, Jesus.

721
00:38:32,567 --> 00:38:34,167
Now people try to be positive.

722
00:38:34,234 --> 00:38:36,334
I see them all the time.
They come, move here.

723
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,434
My building-- Guys get in the elevator,
fuckin’ lacrosse equipment.

724
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:42,300
“What’s up, man?” “Nothin’.”
“So what’s goin’ on?”

725
00:38:42,367 --> 00:38:44,901
“Same thing that’s up, coincidentally.
Nothing.”

726
00:38:47,901 --> 00:38:51,167
This guy goes to me the other day,
I swear to God, in New York City--

727
00:38:51,234 --> 00:38:53,801
It was sunny.
“How much are you lovin’ this sun?”

728
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,701
“Not as much as you are apparently,

729
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:02,567
’cause... you seem to be loving it
like an Aztec priest after an eclipse.

730
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:03,708
Calm down.”

731
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:08,601
I’ve seen the sun, like, 2,000 times.
I’m over it. I’ll be honest with you.

732
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,067
I got it when I was young. The sun.

733
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:14,033
The only thing
that does create New Yorkers

734
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:18,067
out of all the people that move here,
thank God for the true misery creator,

735
00:39:18,133 --> 00:39:20,434
right here, this makes...

736
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:22,767
You take... if you can’t see it.

737
00:39:22,834 --> 00:39:25,801
This... takes nice, Midwestern girls,

738
00:39:25,868 --> 00:39:29,534
peppy, life coach,
motivational speaker personalities--

739
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:33,501
Nine months, you’re walkin’,
that hits your hips, like eight times a--

740
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:36,067
Like six times a month,
you’re like, “Shit.

741
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:39,133
Oh, yeah.
I’m rat in a rat race. I forgot.”

742
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,801
’Cause you can take the nicest girls.
They’re all chirpy, happy.

743
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:44,067
After nine months on that subway--

744
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:47,067
One day, you’re on the subway, they’re
on the subway, you hear the announcement.

745
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:50,100
“Sorry for the delay. Someone jumped
on the tracks and killed themselves.”

746
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:53,067
And they’re like,
“You gotta be shittin’ me right now.

747
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:55,834
What the hell?”

748
00:39:57,133 --> 00:40:01,200
’Cause it’s ugly. That turnstile...
First of all, no one ever lets you in.

749
00:40:01,267 --> 00:40:03,267
They’re off the train.
They don’t need to hurry,

750
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,734
and they still won’t let you go in
when you’re tryin’ to catch the train.

751
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:10,534
You have to wait for somebody whose eyes
look weak and vulnerable enough.

752
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:14,679
You have to make 'em...

753
00:40:16,534 --> 00:40:20,167
Some middle-aged Canadian
tourist lady, and you’re like-- [grunts]

754
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:21,653
Yeah.

755
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:26,434
That’s not nice.
She’s like, “Sorry. Oh, my God.”

756
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:29,060
Yeah, you’re sorry.
And you go down to the train.

757
00:40:29,127 --> 00:40:31,796
The train closes in your face.
I hate-- The train close--

758
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:34,567
Movin’ away. People just look at you.
They don’t even look like, “Sorry.”

759
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,634
They just look at you like...

760
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:43,141
Or if you’re on the local and the express
is there, and it just pulls away.

761
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:46,601
Instead of waiting the extra 30 seconds
till people can get off. Come on.

762
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,714
Unless I’m on the express.
Then I’m like, “Let’s go! Quick, before--”

763
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,752
You hope the conductor doesn’t see
the local comin’ for some reason.

764
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:56,234
Like, “Eh, let’s go.”

765
00:40:56,734 --> 00:40:59,834
Yeah, ’cause I think I’m better
than people if I’m on the express.

766
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:01,968
I think I’m better than the people on--

767
00:41:03,234 --> 00:41:05,701
I mean, literally, they walk
across the platform tryin’ to catch--

768
00:41:05,767 --> 00:41:07,367
They look like suckers, like this.

769
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:10,868
Fuckin’ idiots.

770
00:41:11,634 --> 00:41:12,868
[grunts]

771
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,267
Pleading eyes. Weak.

772
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:20,178
And the subway in the old days,
it was so psychotic.

773
00:41:20,244 --> 00:41:22,814
There was more of a bond.
It was more of a community.

774
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:25,868
Like, no guy would ever sit
if a woman was standing.

775
00:41:25,934 --> 00:41:28,100
’Cause, you know.
The guy could be 103 years old,

776
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,622
just got out of the emergency room,
still got the hospital bracelet on.

777
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,858
Female Olympic athlete.

778
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:36,501
Everybody’s like,
“Get up. Give her your seat.”

779
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,901
Now, guys, because of the iPad,
they can pretend they don’t see.

780
00:41:39,968 --> 00:41:41,767
Got the headphones, sitting there.

781
00:41:41,834 --> 00:41:45,200
A woman’s nine months pregnant.
The fetus is kickin’ me in the forehead.

782
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:49,907
He’s like, “I didn’t feel it.”
“You don’t feel that, you son of a bitch?”

783
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:55,167
Here’s the difference. The subway now--
There are poems on the subway.

784
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:58,567
The MTA puts up “the darling buds of May.”

785
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:01,934
“The city awakens
from its slumber of winter.”

786
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,033
In those days, the MTA put up signs
all over. Saw them a hundred times.

787
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,667
“Remember, it’s chain-snatching season.
So...

788
00:42:13,367 --> 00:42:15,934
So tuck your jewelry into your clothing

789
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,734
and turn your rings around
so the stones don’t show.”

790
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:22,340
That’s the mentality.
It wasn’t: “It’s chain-snatching season,

791
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:25,667
so if you see something,
yell for a transit cop, the conductor.”

792
00:42:25,734 --> 00:42:29,601
No. It’s: “It’s chain-snatching season.
Somebody’s about to get robbed.

793
00:42:30,868 --> 00:42:33,734
Make it not be you. Better them than you.

794
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:36,087
Tuck your shit in so it’s not you.

795
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:39,924
It’s gonna happen, but it might not
happen to you if you tuck shit.”

796
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,228
The subway was so bad,
people would blame you if you got jumped.

797
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:46,934
You’d come back, cut.
“I got jumped on the subway.”

798
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,933
“What happened?” “I was on the last car.”

799
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,035
“Last car? You deserved what you got.”

800
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:56,340
Only an idiot would go on the last car.

801
00:42:56,434 --> 00:42:58,834
Even the transit cops wouldn’t go
on the last car.

802
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:01,634
They’d be like, “Is that the last car?
I’m not going in.”

803
00:43:02,634 --> 00:43:05,901
The whole city had, like, this other vibe.

804
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:08,467
All the things you say now,
the associations then were--

805
00:43:08,534 --> 00:43:11,667
A talk show host would be like,
“I was in Central Park.”

806
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:15,133
Everybody would be like, “Oh-ho.”
That was a joke that you got mugged.

807
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:18,567
Not at night. Like, anytime. Central Park.

808
00:43:18,634 --> 00:43:21,300
If you told somebody,
“I saw your mother on 42nd Street,”

809
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:23,701
they would physically try to kill you.

810
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,705
That was the biggest insult you could say.

811
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,975
“Your mother was on 42nd Street.”
People would fight all the time over that.

812
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:36,314
Now, they’d be like, “Yeah. She works”--
The <i>New York Times</i> building is there.

813
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,901
They got the Graduate Center.

814
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,518
She’s doin’ something
with Playwrights Horizons. I don’t know.

815
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:43,601
Times Square was freakin’--

816
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:46,534
Times Square, you’d get off the train.
Port Authority, walk outside.

817
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:49,834
The pimps would be lined up
like Citi Bikes.

818
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,364
They’d be lined up where the Citi Bikes
are now.

819
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:56,234
All of them just standing there.
A couple of empty slots.

820
00:43:58,267 --> 00:44:00,767
42nd Street was porno, drug dealers,

821
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:04,200
and then, like,
20 shirtless guys with nunchakus.

822
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:08,045
’Cause there were five martial arts stores
on 42nd Street.

823
00:44:08,133 --> 00:44:10,734
Guys standing’ there swingin’ nunchakus.
Everybody’s just watchin’.

824
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:17,567
People go to a play. Nobody went out
to dinner after the theater in New York.

825
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:19,901
Nobody stayed in Times Square.
People wouldn’t even applaud.

826
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:22,527
They’re like, “That’s the end
of the show. Let’s go. Come on.”

827
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:26,831
Yeah, it was psychotic.

828
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:30,334
I mean, people started
to accommodate criminals.

829
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,133
People told you,
“Bring 20 bucks with you.”

830
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,539
“Why? What if I get jumped?”

831
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,841
Because the mugger started to know.

832
00:44:36,934 --> 00:44:39,334
“People aren’t gonna bring money?
We’ll kill a few people.”

833
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,367
They started killin’ people
for havin’ no money.

834
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:43,714
So you’d bring mugger money.
That’s what they’d call it.

835
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:46,701
The muggers knew about it too.
“Gimme your money.”

836
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:47,919
“I left my wallet home.”

837
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,888
“You got your mugger money, right?”
“Of course I do.”

838
00:44:51,334 --> 00:44:52,868
I mean, I’m not--

839
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:57,334
Yeah, people started writing notes
to the car thieves.

840
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,901
You’re writing “no radio”
and putting it in the car.

841
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:04,267
I’m not sayin’ one day. I’m sayin’
the whole city did for 20 years.

842
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,734
“No radio.” “Who’s that for?”
“The car thief.”

843
00:45:06,801 --> 00:45:08,400
I corres--

844
00:45:08,467 --> 00:45:10,968
Puttin’ correspondence with the car thief.

845
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:13,844
Could have had their own stationery.
Would’ve made a lot of money.

846
00:45:13,934 --> 00:45:16,300
The car thieves would read it.
They’d be like,

847
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:18,883
“Come on, man. It says ‘no radio.’
Can’t you read? Let's go”

848
00:45:22,033 --> 00:45:24,801
The city was a hellhole,
but it seemed more authentic.

849
00:45:24,868 --> 00:45:26,667
The people were more down to earth.

850
00:45:26,734 --> 00:45:29,567
Like, the difference
between Mayor de Blasio and Mayor Koch.

851
00:45:29,634 --> 00:45:32,133
Two mayors of New York.
Mayor de Blasio gets up there.

852
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,934
And just... “We need crucial, critical,
fundamental steps to remedy

853
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,770
and measures to address some

854
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:42,974
of the challenges
and the obstacles that we face."

855
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:45,801
Once in a while,
he’ll throw a little New York thing in.

856
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:48,901
“As we New Yorkers say,
‘Forget about it.’”

857
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,182
[groans]

858
00:45:51,249 --> 00:45:53,150
Koch was always in a wrinkled shirt.

859
00:45:53,234 --> 00:45:54,701
He just got out of...

860
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,100
He’d be at the Kew Gardens Senior Center.

861
00:45:58,167 --> 00:45:59,701
You know.

862
00:45:59,767 --> 00:46:03,400
Some old lady’s yelling at him.
“You promised us last year

863
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,434
there’d be a stoplight
on Parsons Boulevard.

864
00:46:05,501 --> 00:46:08,300
Well, I haven’t seen anything.”

865
00:46:08,367 --> 00:46:11,968
He’d just start yelling at you.
“Lady, you oughta get your head examined.”

866
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:16,934
“You have a screw loose.
There’s no money. You’re not getting that.

867
00:46:18,701 --> 00:46:20,701
You wanna cross Parsons Boulevard? Run.

868
00:46:20,767 --> 00:46:23,467
I’m running across right now
to get the hell outta here.”

869
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:26,234
He had no bodyguards.
Just get on the E train by himself.

870
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,567
“These ladies make me sick.
I’ll never go back to Kew Gardens again.”

871
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:32,934
Yeah. The New York personality.

872
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,901
The cynical, opinionated, brutal, loud...

873
00:46:36,961 --> 00:46:39,096
You’d think it was gone. No.

874
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:41,801
That’s the only immigrants
that make it here,

875
00:46:41,866 --> 00:46:44,101
if you’ll notice, are the ones
that have all those qualities.

876
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,638
They’re not, “Hey, tired, poor.” They got
a shit attitude. That’s how you make it.

877
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:50,374
Starting with the Greeks.
They came in the ’60s.

878
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,276
Rude-polite, that’s what they do.

879
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:54,534
They were rude-po-- Turnover.

880
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:57,667
Their whole business
in their diners was turnover.

881
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:01,152
So they’re welcoming you in,
but kicking you out at the same time.

882
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,601
They’re like, “My friend, I love it.
I know. Eggs, bacon, home fries.

883
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,391
You like the French fries better.

884
00:47:07,467 --> 00:47:10,100
Give him the home fries.
Give him the check.

885
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:15,166
Come on, let’s get him out of here.
The fuck outta-- Come on. Kick him."

886
00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:16,734
They loom over the stool.

887
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:18,934
Send him to the cashier.
They always blame the cashier.

888
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,901
She’s the only non-Greek in the place.

889
00:47:20,968 --> 00:47:24,234
She’d have the bouffant hairdo
and the cat glasses.

890
00:47:24,767 --> 00:47:27,100
You know.
You think she’s just some old lady.

891
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,849
She was an Instagram star today back
in the ’50s.

892
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:35,067
Like a real hottie.
Like a Miss Subways runner-up.

893
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:38,601
The hand job queen of Ebbets Field
or some shit.

894
00:47:39,834 --> 00:47:43,000
She went to high school
with everybody from-- the real goodfellas.

895
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,994
She’s like, “Yeah, they were cowards.

896
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:46,497
My boyfriend beat the shit outta half
of those guys.”

897
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:50,801
You can’t be nice and last in the city.
I witnessed it.

898
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:54,305
Haitians and Jamaicans got
to New York in the early ’70s.

899
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,634
Right away they had to be tough.

900
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:58,634
The Haitians,
first of all, they were fearless.

901
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:00,501
They weren’t tough, just fearless.

902
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:03,200
Nobody could hit them harder
than their father.

903
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:05,950
Their father would come up to school
and beat them in the middle of class.

904
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,552
[Haitian accent] “Who are you
to disrespect these teachers?”

905
00:48:11,567 --> 00:48:14,567
They weren’t scared of any kids.
They’d just quote the New Testament.

906
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,894
“By scribe and Pharisee,
you do not intimidate."

907
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,064
The Jamaicans would quote
the Old Testament.

908
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:22,466
[Jamaican accent] “Abraham and Jacob.”

909
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,000
And Jamaicans-- Fun historical fact.

910
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:27,634
Jamaicans were the first black guys

911
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:30,634
it was socially acceptable
for white girls to date.

912
00:48:30,701 --> 00:48:35,534
Before it was okay to date
black Americans, I heard it all the time:

913
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:39,000
“She’s goin’ out with a black guy.”
“He’s Jamaican.” “Oh.”

914
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:45,701
I don’t know why. Pot. Bob Marley.
I don’t know, folks. I just report it.

915
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:47,000
Then, um...

916
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:49,901
the Chinese and Koreans came.

917
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:53,167
Notice, the Japanese had to go to
Fort Lee. They couldn’t stay in the city.

918
00:48:53,234 --> 00:48:55,968
’Cause they were polite,
tryin’ to be friendly.

919
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:00,267
Chinese are not on a charm offensive,
to put it mildly.

920
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:05,042
First of all, they kept
the Lenape Indian’s cigarette thing going.

921
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,178
When the rest
of the city abandoned smoking--

922
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,814
You go to any one
of the four Chinatowns in New York,

923
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,450
it’s like they never heard
of Mayor Bloomberg.

924
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:18,601
“Yeah. There was Giuliani
and then this guy de Blasio.”

925
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,133
“There was a guy in the middle.”
“Don’t worry about it.”

926
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:25,167
Not friendly. They’re workaholics.
Workaholics aren’t frie--

927
00:49:25,234 --> 00:49:27,667
Koreans. They tried to make Koreans--
Remember in the ’90s?

928
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,700
Koreans are unfriendly.
They gotta be friendly.

929
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:32,703
They tried.
They had classes to try to be friendly.

930
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:34,968
But it’s just not what they do. They try.

931
00:49:35,033 --> 00:49:38,234
“Hot enough for y--
I can’t do this. I can’t.

932
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:41,601
I got four hand trucks to unload.”
They just wanna work the whole time.

933
00:49:41,667 --> 00:49:44,200
No one’s ever leaning at the Korean deli.

934
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:47,501
Nobody’s ever leaning. You got
a 40-year-old guy stocking the shelves.

935
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,968
Twelve-year-old girl’s working
the register doin’ her homework.

936
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,023
The 100-year-old grandfather sittin’
on a crate,

937
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:55,259
pickin’ snow peas at 2:00 in the mornin’
by himself.

938
00:49:57,734 --> 00:50:01,067
Once in a while the manager-- here’s
the vacation-- after a 20-hour shift,

939
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:04,033
walks out and leans
on his own body weight for ten seconds.

940
00:50:05,133 --> 00:50:07,234
Then they’re like, “Break’s over.”
“I know.”

941
00:50:08,873 --> 00:50:10,674
The only friendly thing they did,
they brought flowers.

942
00:50:10,767 --> 00:50:12,567
There were no flowers
at the bodegas before--

943
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,901
The Koreans just showed up
with flowers in the ’80s.

944
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:17,868
They must’ve thought that was enough.
But they don’t go near them.

945
00:50:17,934 --> 00:50:22,234
They make the Mexican guy guard them.
Mexicans do every job nobody else will.

946
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:24,355
Even among the immigrants, I’m sayin’.

947
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:28,292
Like, all the immigrants make fun
of how lazy we are as Americans.

948
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:31,701
Like, “Oh, I hurt my foot.
I need a vacation. I’m American.”

949
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:36,200
Mexicans make fun of how lazy the other
immigrants are. That’s how much they work.

950
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,501
They’re like,
“I only put 18 hours in. I’m Korean.”

951
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,574
Dominicans. Dominicans came over.

952
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:48,245
First of all, Dominicans came over 1980,
’81. They had the Puerto Ricans goin’,

953
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:52,416
“Who are these people blasting music,
staying up all night? I’m tryin’ to sleep.

954
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:56,754
I like a party. A party’s a party.
There’s a time and a place for a party.

955
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:59,757
And they’re speaking Spanish.
I understand it, but I don’t speak it.”

956
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:03,367
The Dominicans, they made themselves
right at home when they came here.

957
00:51:03,434 --> 00:51:06,634
Because the first non-Lenape Indian--

958
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:10,033
The first immigrant resident of Manhattan
was a Dominican,

959
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,667
a Dominican trader named Juan Rodriguez.

960
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:14,038
That’s a true thing.
Some trader who’s like,

961
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,173
[Dominican accent]
“I come to trade. You don’t wanna trade.

962
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:19,234
I don’t wanna argue with you,
but I came here. I bring sugar.

963
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,801
And you wanna hand me...
I don’t want beads. I go home and then--

964
00:51:22,868 --> 00:51:25,501
They’re gonna think it’s gang-related.
I don’t fuck around.”

965
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:28,334
Some Dominican, he was the first
Manhattan resident, basically,

966
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:30,721
except for the Lenape Indians,
was a Dominican trader.

967
00:51:30,788 --> 00:51:33,123
Russia-- How do you think
Russians lasted here?

968
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,328
They’re more sarcastic than all of us.
You ever try to small talk a Russian?

969
00:51:39,534 --> 00:51:42,334
I’m at the Sheep’s Head Bay train station.
Beautiful Russian girl.

970
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:44,068
“Boy, this train is late.”

971
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,971
“Yes, and mindless chatter
will not accelerate.”

972
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,773
Yeah.

973
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,945
Albanians?
Albanians, big part of New York.

974
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,914
I’m not even gonna say anything
about Albanians.

975
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:59,917
And that should say everything
you need to know about Albanians.

976
00:52:01,901 --> 00:52:03,234
You know.

977
00:52:08,501 --> 00:52:10,767
East Indians? East Indians.

978
00:52:10,834 --> 00:52:14,400
Friendly everywhere else.
New York? They had to learn how to fight.

979
00:52:14,467 --> 00:52:18,167
And I’m saying-- They fight.
They’ll never raise their voice.

980
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,100
But they always gotta get the last word.

981
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:23,307
The guy’s outta the store.
The trouble’s over.

982
00:52:23,374 --> 00:52:25,376
They gotta get a shot.
It brings them back.

983
00:52:25,467 --> 00:52:28,501
The guy’s drunk.
He’s like, “Fuck you, Bin Laden.”

984
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:32,082
He’s like, “Okay, sir. Go and smoke crack.
I don’t know where you're gonna--”

985
00:52:33,534 --> 00:52:36,100
The guy’s like,
“What did you just fuckin’ say to me?”

986
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:39,300
“Nothing, sir. Please leave.
I don’t want trouble.” “Just shut up.”

987
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:43,300
“All right. You are uneducated person.
I understand.

988
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:47,701
Even you go in jail,
your family happy and relieved too.”

989
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:50,968
Arabs. When I was growing up,

990
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:54,471
there were a lot of Arab candy store,
grocery stores in Park Slope.

991
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,508
And all the Arab stores--
Even as kids, we knew,

992
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,377
don’t rob the Arab store
unless you absolutely--

993
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:02,968
the other stores banned you or something.

994
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:06,167
All the other stores,
you run out with the candy. You shopli--

995
00:53:06,234 --> 00:53:10,200
The owner runs three feet. He’s out
of breath. “I’m callin’ the cops.”

996
00:53:10,267 --> 00:53:14,501
Arab guy-- First, you go in the store,
there was never anybody else in there.

997
00:53:15,133 --> 00:53:16,701
It’s always deserted.

998
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:19,133
He’s 130 pounds, lookin’ at you.

999
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,367
And then he realizes, these kids aren’t
buyin’ anything. They’re here to shoplift.

1000
00:53:22,434 --> 00:53:26,200
You see a look come over his face.
It wasn’t fear. It wasn’t anger.

1001
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:27,501
It was, like, calm.

1002
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:31,067
Just like,
“I see. Now, my destiny is this.”

1003
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:33,934
Usually, I’d chicken out right then.

1004
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,167
Once in a while you’re like,
“Aw, screw that,” and run.

1005
00:53:36,234 --> 00:53:40,434
He starts chasing you. You turn around
two blocks later, still chasin’.

1006
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:42,820
You drop the candy.
He doesn’t stop for his own candy.

1007
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,689
’Cause now it’s not even about that.
It’s about a principle.

1008
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:48,868
You know, like a... Code of Hammurabi.

1009
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,234
Like, his store--
It’s like eye for an eye.

1010
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:54,131
Tooth for a Three Musketeers bar.
You know.

1011
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,669
But that was the beauty of New York was--
It still is.

1012
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:00,467
You can go into a store,
you’re in another country.

1013
00:54:00,534 --> 00:54:03,567
You walk in. The guy’s Pakistani,
got a beard down to here.

1014
00:54:03,634 --> 00:54:05,467
In the back, the uncle.
Everyone’s sittin’ on crates

1015
00:54:05,534 --> 00:54:09,634
playin’ a card game that was outlawed
during the Crimean War or some shit.

1016
00:54:09,701 --> 00:54:11,234
You know?

1017
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:14,752
And, gettin’ a cab--
Before stupid <i>Taxi TV</i>--

1018
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:18,534
Every time I’d go in a cab,
you’re in a different country.

1019
00:54:18,601 --> 00:54:21,567
The guy’s, like, on the phone to Senegal.

1020
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:24,901
There’s some music playin’
from Central African Republic.

1021
00:54:24,968 --> 00:54:28,033
There’s a little amulet from,
like, his village when he left.

1022
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,300
They’re like, “Good luck.”

1023
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:32,334
It’s a big deal. It’s a drama-- To him--

1024
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,767
Like, you see him, he’s livin’, like,
five people sleeping in shifts.

1025
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,009
But he goes home once a year, Senegal.

1026
00:54:39,076 --> 00:54:41,645
He’s like LeBron
when he went back to Cleveland.

1027
00:54:42,834 --> 00:54:44,000
He’s the star of the village.

1028
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:47,634
They’re like, “I told you he was gonna
come back. You said he wasn’t, see?”

1029
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:51,555
The amazing thing is everybody

1030
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,824
from every country packed
in a little city.

1031
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:55,659
One-hundred-sixty languages
in Queens alone.

1032
00:54:55,734 --> 00:54:58,334
But you’re not supposed
to mention ethnicity of course.

1033
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,667
That’s the other problem.

1034
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,700
You just have to vaguely look around
and golf clap.

1035
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:07,100
If you see something, you’re not
supposed to have a reaction to it.

1036
00:55:07,167 --> 00:55:09,834
Even if it’s another culture
and it shocks you at the beginning.

1037
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:12,300
Forgive me. If I’m walking
on Roosevelt Avenue,

1038
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:15,434
and I see a couple of Ecuadorean guys
in cowboy boots,

1039
00:55:15,501 --> 00:55:18,767
carryin’ 50 slaughtered guinea pigs
on Sixth-- I’ve seen it.

1040
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:24,267
Like <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>
Just all these skulls of guinea pigs.

1041
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:27,825
I reel back, almost knock over the guy
on his prayer mat,

1042
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,861
doing his call to Mecca next
to the food cart.

1043
00:55:30,934 --> 00:55:35,167
If I go, “Oh, my God,” a well-intentioned
white person scurries over

1044
00:55:35,234 --> 00:55:37,968
to explain cultural relativity to me.

1045
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:39,567
“You know...

1046
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,373
hillbillies also cure their food,
and they’re hyper-religious.

1047
00:55:43,467 --> 00:55:45,968
I don’t know if you realize.
So you shouldn’t say”...

1048
00:55:46,033 --> 00:55:47,901
I’m like, “Thank you.

1049
00:55:47,968 --> 00:55:50,801
Where once I was blind, now I can see.
Thank you.

1050
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:54,451
Until you came along, I don’t know what--"

1051
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:58,901
Because they want, you know, everything
to be authentic, artisanal, vinyl,

1052
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:01,658
but when it comes to ethnicity,
go generic-speak at all times.

1053
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,662
I was in Brooklyn once.
This kid got mad at me.

1054
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:08,367
He’s like, “You see somebody pass here?”
“What’d he look like?”

1055
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:09,766
“What’d he look like?

1056
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:14,834
He had a green shirt,
a brown tie, blue jacket.”

1057
00:56:14,901 --> 00:56:17,667
“What color was he?”
“I don’t see color, all right?”

1058
00:56:20,334 --> 00:56:24,434
I mean, if you don’t want to see color,
go to Brooklyn. It’s 100% white now.

1059
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:27,200
When did that happen?

1060
00:56:27,267 --> 00:56:28,934
I mean...

1061
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:32,767
Brooklyn’s so white,
they have Black Lives Matter protests,

1062
00:56:32,834 --> 00:56:34,734
half the protesters are white,
in Brooklyn.

1063
00:56:34,801 --> 00:56:38,434
I’ve seen white kids yelling,
“Black lives matter,” at black cops.

1064
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,367
And they’re tryin’ to...

1065
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:44,567
They’re tryin’ to say...

1066
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:48,100
They’re tryin’ to say,
“I’m tryin’ to protect you from yourself.”

1067
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,610
I go on the L--
When I was a kid, L train...

1068
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:56,601
Wouldn’t go near the L train.
You couldn’t catch me on the L train.

1069
00:56:56,667 --> 00:56:58,968
You know... I go on the L train now,

1070
00:56:59,016 --> 00:57:01,585
2:00 in the morning,
it looks like a ski lift.

1071
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,234
Kids with iPads out.

1072
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:11,795
iPads, cell phones.
Like, $400, in their hands.

1073
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:15,866
When I was growing up, any train,
immediately, your money in your underwear,

1074
00:57:15,934 --> 00:57:17,267
your bus pass in your--

1075
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,734
Now, they’re sittin’ there,
$400 basically. A train full of kids.

1076
00:57:22,801 --> 00:57:26,234
And you know there’s gotta be one guy
who was in jail since 1979.

1077
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:29,434
Just got out. He’s on the L train
goin’ to stay at his mother’s.

1078
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,182
And he was, like,
the hardcore gangbanger.

1079
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,685
He’s, like, the guy
that killed Mike Tyson’s pigeons.

1080
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:40,824
He’s just half asleep and wakes up
and sees a car full of white kids

1081
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:42,592
holding $400 in their hand.

1082
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,334
He probably just starts crying.
“This is all I ever wanted when I was a--

1083
00:57:49,167 --> 00:57:52,634
I had to go to the Upper East Side
to find white people.”

1084
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,371
In those days, there were no blond people.

1085
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:58,408
The only blond people were-- Greenpoint
was all Polish. But nobody ever saw it.

1086
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,178
You just heard about this place
called Greenpoint.

1087
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:05,415
Nobody would be on the G train. That was
like, “What are you doin’? G train?”

1088
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:09,052
It’s packed now.
In those days, it was deserted.

1089
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,156
And Polish people, who also contributed
a lot-- They were big immigrants.

1090
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,292
They contributed a lot to New York.
I didn’t talk about them.

1091
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,362
In those days,
people would make Polish jokes.

1092
00:58:18,434 --> 00:58:22,033
Talk about stereotype.
They used to say Polish people are stupid.

1093
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,434
That was the big joke.
Polish people are stupid. Cruel.

1094
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:27,334
And why? There’s not even a reason for it.

1095
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,673
Why? Because they said,
“We want to live in the neighborhood

1096
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:32,133
that’s so close you can almost
touch Manhattan,

1097
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,234
but by train it takes two
and a half hours?” I don’t know.

1098
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,048
I’m sure they have their reasons.

1099
00:58:38,901 --> 00:58:40,634
They have their reasons, folks.

1100
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,868
It’s not for us to say why they did.
They have their thing.

1101
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:50,794
I’ll tell you a Polish joke right now.

1102
00:58:50,868 --> 00:58:53,934
It won’t be the same,
but it’ll still be funny.

1103
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,667
Times change. You wanna be sensitive.
Here’s the Polish joke.

1104
00:58:56,734 --> 00:59:00,868
A Polish guy... See right away,
even that seems tone-deaf to me.

1105
00:59:00,904 --> 00:59:03,340
No because there's gotta be a guy
in the joke.

1106
00:59:03,434 --> 00:59:06,400
Like, a Polish guy...
Could be a girl. Let’s say it’s a girl.

1107
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:09,567
A Polish girl. A Polish girl. Hey. Hey.

1108
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:11,815
Let’s open it up for that matter.

1109
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:15,152
A Polish member of the LGBTQ community.

1110
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:19,389
A Polish member of the LGBTQ.

1111
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:22,426
No. I tell you what. We’ll bring it back.
This’ll cover--

1112
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:26,696
A Polish guy, but he self-identifies
as a Polish girl. All right?

1113
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:32,267
Forget it. We’ll start...
A person of Polish extraction.

1114
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:34,734
It has nothin’ to do
with the punch line anyway.

1115
00:59:34,801 --> 00:59:37,634
If I have to rely on that
for the punch line, where’s the--

1116
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:40,701
A person of Polish--
And when I say Polish, obviously,

1117
00:59:40,744 --> 00:59:44,448
it’s a little reductive to the rest
of Eastern Europe to say Polish.

1118
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:47,567
No, because Eastern Europe, there’s a--

1119
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:49,953
I don’t want to marginalize the rest
of Eastern Europe.

1120
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:51,167
’Cause that’s punching down.

1121
00:59:51,234 --> 00:59:53,567
And comedy never punches down.
It only punches up.

1122
00:59:53,634 --> 00:59:57,868
I’ve read that from 50 people
that never did comedy. They all said...

1123
00:59:57,934 --> 00:59:59,267
[laughter]

1124
00:59:59,334 --> 01:00:02,467
What? All right. Listen. Here’s the joke.

1125
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:07,100
I’m not telling this again,
but you can tell this on the way home.

1126
01:00:07,137 --> 01:00:11,842
A featureless, colorless, nonsectarian...

1127
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,980
non-gender specific... person...

1128
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:19,567
of indeterminate origin...

1129
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:22,968
walks into a bar.

1130
01:00:24,868 --> 01:00:26,033
Um...

1131
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:30,594
When you’re careful
and nice and sincere, that’s fine.

1132
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:33,734
It’s not funny. Funny.
New York was clumsy.

1133
01:00:33,801 --> 01:00:37,601
New York’s, like, the city--
It’s just reckless. It’s impulsive.

1134
01:00:37,667 --> 01:00:41,171
It’s accidental.
The whole city is an accident.

1135
01:00:41,267 --> 01:00:44,100
This whole city was an accident.
It wasn’t even supposed to--

1136
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:46,701
Henry Hudson,
the explorer that started this whole--

1137
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,712
He was on his way to China.

1138
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:50,968
He was tryin’ to find China.
I swear to God.

1139
01:00:51,014 --> 01:00:52,582
He got lost.

1140
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:55,952
He’s comin’ down the river.
Here’s the Lenapes lookin’ at him.

1141
01:00:56,033 --> 01:00:57,367
“What’s this?”

1142
01:00:57,434 --> 01:00:59,267
He comes over. They’re like, “What’s up?”

1143
01:00:59,334 --> 01:01:02,567
He’s like, “I’m lost.
I don’t know where I’m goin’.”

1144
01:01:02,634 --> 01:01:05,267
“You’re lost? Where you tryin’ to go?”

1145
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:07,534
He goes...

1146
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:09,501
He goes, “China.”

1147
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:11,501
“You’re tryin’ to go to China.”

1148
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:13,367
[laughter]
