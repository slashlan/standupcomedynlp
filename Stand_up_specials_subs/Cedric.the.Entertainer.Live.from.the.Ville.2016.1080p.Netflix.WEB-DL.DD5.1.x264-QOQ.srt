1
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:16,474
He one of the OGs,
one of the all-time greats.

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,351
He can make you laugh with a look.

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,732
He is a legend in the stand-up game.

4
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,316
Yes.

5
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:30,572
He's so good.
He's completely unique. I love the guy.

6
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:34,701
The hardest gig I ever did
was following Cedric the Entertainer

7
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:37,370
on New Year's Eve in Oakland.

8
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,123
Talented, gifted, naturally funny.

9
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:42,083
As good as it gets.

10
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:50,049
Give it up
for the Tennessee State marching band!

Cedric the Entertainer!

23
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,223
Wassup?

24
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,936
Nashville.

25
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,896
Cashville.

26
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,942
What up, y'all?

27
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,655
Yay!

28
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,117
Yeah, man.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,244
Hey, how y'all doing?

30
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,164
I feel y'all. Go and have a seat.

31
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,082
How y'all doing, man?

32
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:51,254
Y'all gotta give up for that TSU band.
Let 'em hear it.

33
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:58,928
That shit wore me out.

34
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,640
I only did the last two minutes
of the dance.

35
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,019
I'm-a-be like this.

36
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,645
They let you know, boy.

37
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,064
Gotta get in shape, man.

38
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,693
Try to do it. I'm gonna be breathing,
with an "F."

39
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:17,238
I had a "bref," my "bref" was...

40
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,949
Oh, my "bref."

41
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:26,623
Man, I see y'all too, looking good.
What up?

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,544
Laid up in here too, I saw.

43
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:35,632
Player with all white on, I see you, pimp.
You know it.

44
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,968
Any of you know how
to eat barbecue like this?

45
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,147
Tell your mama Rufus stopped by.

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,819
Look at this, man.

47
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,114
It's good.

48
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:04,118
I was joking about getting in shape,
but that shit is real. You gotta do that.

49
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,996
That's the latest thing.
Everybody gotta lose weight.

50
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,917
I got all the equipment at my house.
I don't do none of it.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,212
I got everything you can order
on the infomercial.

52
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,548
I got so much equipment,
my neighbors come and work out.

53
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,969
I got my own... sell my own
gym membership. "Y'all come in.

54
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:25,014
There's some towels, cucumber water.
Go on, enjoy yourself, John.

55
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,227
I ain't using none of that shit.
Go on in."

56
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,730
Gotta try to do it. I had to do something.

57
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,150
I'm walking down the street.
This lady sees me, a little white lady.

58
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,903
She got a little daughter.
She sees me. "Oh, my God.

59
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,949
I can't believe it's you.
Can we take a picture?" "Of course!"

60
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,326
She talking about,
"Thank you, CeeLo!"

61
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,002
C-CeeLo?

62
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,755
Uh, bitch...
♪ Fuck you! ♪

63
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,675
And little girl...
♪ Fuck you too! ♪

64
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,469
I ain't no goddamn CeeLo.

65
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,596
Shit.

66
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,686
I walked right into a cycling class,
nigga.

67
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,944
Shit, man.

68
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,864
I gotta do something.
Everybody losin' weight in Hollywood.

69
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:26,200
All my partners. Ain't nobody call me
and tell me nothing.

70
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:30,288
I'm like the last fat brother
in Hollywood.

71
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:33,458
Anthony Anderson lost weight.
He ain't called me to tell me.

72
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,793
Rick Ross lost weight.

73
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,837
The Boss, he's...

74
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,256
He all skinny as hell, like, "Eh."

75
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,345
Al Roker, Al Sharpton.

76
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:50,141
You know, Al Sharpton lost too much
goddamn weight though.

77
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,310
Al Sharpton lost neck weight.

78
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,731
His head look like a damn bobblehead.

79
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,738
Like Al, you can't lose neck weight.

80
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,866
You can't have no perm
and no little-ass neck like that.

81
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:11,954
That combination don't go together, Al,
is what I'm trying to say.

82
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,209
Come out here feeling good, man.

83
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,127
Lookin' good. Everybody all spiffy.

84
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,712
- Whoo!
- I like that.

85
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,131
I like to get G'd up. We from that...

86
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,801
- We from that generation.
- Yeah!

87
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,095
I notice how the new kids
are dressing.

88
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,598
They ain't really give
a shit about clothes no more.

89
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,309
They don't really give a shit.
Especially boys.

90
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,354
The thing is, I ain't trying to say
they style is...

91
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:41,359
It's for their generation, don't get me
wrong, but it's a little asexual.

92
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:45,113
All the little long-ass T-shirts
niggas is wearing now.

93
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,908
One little boy, his shirt was so long,
he had a train on the back.

94
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,621
I'm like, "Where's the reception,
motherfucker? Shit."

95
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,253
I think it started with skinny jeans.

96
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,505
You know what I mean.

97
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,924
The jegging kind,
the real super-skinny ones.

98
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,261
I ain't trying to say skinny jeans gay.
I don't know that to be true.

99
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,638
What I'm sayin' is,
it's a gateway apparel.

100
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:16,436
It leads to other gay articles
of clothing is what I'm saying.

101
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,898
'Cause there ain't no time should a dude
ever be putting their jeans on like this.

102
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,820
Never!

103
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,947
Ever.

104
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,997
Sagging. That shit went too far.
I used to get sagging.

105
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,999
When it first came out, I understood it,

106
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:42,462
because that's when new
designer underwear came on the scene.

107
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:45,923
So you want to let somebody know
that he Tommy Hilfiger, that he Gucci.

108
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:50,052
"Look, these ain't no regular
Fruit of the Looms is what I got on."

109
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,637
I got that.

110
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,808
Now these dudes got they pants
all up under they ass and shit.

111
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,311
I saw one little boy,
didn't have his pants on.

112
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,063
That nigga had his shit on his shoulders.

113
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:09,030
"It's that new, Ced.
We don't even wear our shit no more, man.

114
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,658
We just carry it with us in case
we gotta run in somewhere, man."

115
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,581
It's a trip, man.

116
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,083
They music has changed too, boy.
That young music.

117
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,129
I like rap, all kinds of rap,
but rap got so aggressive now, man.

118
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,591
Like when we came up,
it used to be sexual innuendo.

119
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,803
They might be talkin' about something.
You had to figure it out. "Oh, okay."

120
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:36,098
Y'all heard "Down in the DM"?
They ain't got time for that shit.

121
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:40,895
♪ It go down in the DM, it go down
It go down in the DM, it go down ♪

122
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,480
♪ Snapchat me that pussy ♪

123
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,608
Oh, whoa! Whoa!

124
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,902
Ooh, Jesus.

125
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,113
♪ Or FaceTime me that pussy if it's cool ♪

126
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,119
What did they...

127
00:08:57,203 --> 00:09:00,581
On the record?
That's on the radio right now.

128
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,334
When I first heard it,
I ain't know what Snapchat was.

129
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,962
I thought he said,
"Snatch at me that pussy."

130
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:08,214
I said that is pretty aggressive

131
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,050
with all this Bill Cosby stuff
goin' on right now.

132
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,638
I don't think you wanna be snatching
at nobody's pussy like that now."

133
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,849
They were like, "No, Ced, it's Snapchat.
It's Snapchat."

134
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,435
That's an app.
I don't know if y'all know this.

135
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,522
That's a little app.
It's what all the kids on right now.

136
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,358
And you can take a picture
of your pussy, now, okay?

137
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:32,405
And you can put it up on the Internet,
and it will disappear like a snowflake.

138
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,240
Okay? It will be gone.

139
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,618
So whenever you bored and you just
feel like doin' something...

140
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,829
Snapchat your pussy on out there!

141
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,748
Snapchat your pussy. All the way.

142
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,003
It's fine. I ain't know what it was.

143
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,756
Soon as I heard you can do that shit,
I downloaded that app immediately.

144
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,845
I would be ridin' around in my car,
lookin' at the app now and then.

145
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,806
Ain't nobody Snapchat on mine.
I ain't got no...

146
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,685
I don't know how this work.
Don't nobody put none on mine.

147
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,106
"Snapchat me that pussy."

148
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,277
All they little songs. I like all rap.

149
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,363
Fetty Wap. That's another rapper
had a big hit. Fetty Wap.

150
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:18,367
Big rapper. Y'all know Fetty Wap.
That's the rapper with one eye.

151
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,579
Fetty Wap had a little accident
earlier in the year

152
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,581
where he was on a motorcycle.

153
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,667
And I was thinkin' to myself,
"You know what, Fetty Wap?

154
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,879
Uh..."

155
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,256
"Your head got one eye.

156
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,842
You might not wanna be on
no goddamn motorcycle.

157
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,139
You gotta have your peripheral
when you on a goddamn motorcycle.

158
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:45,436
You can't turn all way left, nigga,
every time you tryin' to turn.

159
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,731
Stay off goddamn motorcycles, okay?
With love."

160
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:56,322
But he dope though. I like him
'cause he got a melodic kind of rap style.

161
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,993
It's got melody to it, but out of nowhere,
it'll turn into some gangsta shit.

162
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,789
So it be a love song,
and then out of nowhere, it be a tragedy.

163
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,833
So it like a Fetty Wapera, if you will.

164
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:12,797
Fetty Wap be like,
♪ Baby, won't you come my way ♪

165
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,176
♪ Tell me what you want to say ♪

166
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,427
♪ But first off ♪

167
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,097
♪ I'm gonna start by saying this: Ay ♪

168
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,975
♪ Two head shots
if you try to take my bitch ♪

169
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,019
Like, whoa!

170
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,231
Whoa, what just happened there? You know.

171
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,026
That is mighty aggressive, Fetty Wap.

172
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,278
I just saying
she looked nice in her dress.

173
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,533
I don't think I deserve two shots
in the damn head for that, you know.

174
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,620
I don't think the crime
fits the punishment.

175
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,625
Even the girls are aggressive.

176
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,045
I heard the most aggressive language
I've heard in a record this year came

177
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,174
from a little girl. I'm riding
in the car with my 12-year-old daughter.

178
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,759
She's singing along.

179
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:03,055
All of a sudden, this girl say the most
craziest shit I ever heard in a song.

180
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,476
She like, ♪ You gotta eat
the booty like groceries ♪ Now wait.

181
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,940
What? Ooh, Lord,
where's Yolanda Adams when you need her?

182
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,862
"You gotta eat the booty like groceries"?

183
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,242
Don't get me wrong, I'm over 40,
so I'm willing to participate

184
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,660
is what I'm saying...

185
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,623
I just need to know how much groceries
we talkin' about right now.

186
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:32,918
Is it ten items or less or...

187
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,464
Or are we talking Costco's,
now, 'cause I think...

188
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,966
Somebody yell up here,
"Come on, help me with the groceries!"

189
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,760
That's too much goddamn groceries.
I can't...

190
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:44,305
I can't eat that much groceries.

191
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,683
All these little songs, man.

192
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,354
They got songs that be making dudes...
gotta get your manhood together.

193
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:56,358
Like Rihanna little song. I turn that off
every time it come on. I can't listen.

194
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,154
'Cause it make you do some bullshit.
You a grown man. You came here.

195
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,698
♪ Let me see you work, work,
work, work, work ♪

196
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,037
Why the fuck am I doin' this right now?

197
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,831
Unh-unh.

198
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,960
Rihanna always got songs like that.
She always tripping.

199
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,214
'Cause her other song last year
was a scary song to me.

200
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,299
♪ Shine bright like a diamond ♪

201
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,347
♪ Shine bright like a diamond ♪

202
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,350
I'm like, "Is she a little witch?
What the hell is she doing?"

203
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,101
Scary-ass little song.

204
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:34,647
♪ Shine bright like a diamond ♪
I ain't like that song.

205
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,650
That song scares me.
I live out in the mountains.

206
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,528
I came home one night
and our lights was off at the house.

207
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:44,323
Right when I was parking to go in,
that song came on.

208
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,159
♪ Shine bright like a diamond ♪

209
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,663
I think I'll stay in the car till morning.
I was like, "Unh-unh.

210
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,792
No, this how a motherfucker get killed.
I ain't ready to get out the damn car."

211
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,794
Scary-ass song.

212
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:02,007
Beyoncé, she another one.
She's been killing the game.

213
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,177
Everybody know the Lemonade shit.

214
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,889
Look at the ladies, ladies get it.
Dudes like, "I don't get it."

215
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,975
Lemonade got too much tea in it for me.

216
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,352
She telling too much
of her goddamn business.

217
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,565
Thing is, you know,
she's just dope like that though.

218
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:21,360
Beyoncé, she kinda got like songs
that's always empowerment.

219
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,904
She do make people mad
one way or the other.

220
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,116
She made me mad when she had
that song about the elevator,

221
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,202
when she talking about Jay Z
and Solange fighting on the elevator.

222
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:34,498
I was mad 'cause she was goin' all off
about the elevator shit.

223
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:40,379
When I think about it, it's been a couple
of hard years for elevators in general.

224
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:45,259
I just don't trust elevators
the way I used to.

225
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:49,263
You remember, the whole Ray Rice shit...
that happened on the elevator.

226
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,808
Then Beyoncé and Solange, they was
lookin' for Jay Z on the elevator.

227
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,311
And I was checkin' into the hotel today,

228
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,355
the manager asks me, "We got you
in the best room on the top floor."

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,316
I said, "Oh, no.

230
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,904
No, no. What y'all got by the gift shop,
my nigga? I ain't trying...

231
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:08,407
I ain't tryin' to go up
no goddamn elevator.

232
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,034
I already know

233
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,995
what happens in elevators,
and I ain't goin' up on one."

234
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,919
Beyoncé cool. She dope with it though.
That's the thing about it.

235
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,340
She be writing all these women
empowerment songs that be so beautiful.

236
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,926
She talented, she sexy,
she good to look at.

237
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,512
That's why she confuse dudes,
'cause we like lookin' at her,

238
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,682
but then her songs be dope,
and they be good songs.

239
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,602
You be, "Man, we ain't supposed to be
singing this part."

240
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,481
But she will have you out there, you know?

241
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,776
Like now, if I went...
♪ We be all night ♪

242
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,864
There better not be one dude
in this motherfucker talkin' about...

243
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,245
Nigga, that ain't your part, player.

244
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,000
You cannot...

245
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,797
You gotta wait on Jay Z
like everybody else.

246
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,092
♪ I do think up this shit,
if I do say so myself ♪

247
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,803
That's us. That's where we come in.

248
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,932
We cannot...

249
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:18,978
The trip is that nowadays, certain shit
be gay, we didn't even know it.

250
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:22,690
You be, "That's gay now?" "Yeah,
that's gay. You can't do that no more."

251
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,902
Little shit like, dudes, you can't be
talkin' to another dude on the phone

252
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,696
and hung up talkin' about "bye-bye."

253
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,036
That's gay, man.

254
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,123
We can't say "bye-bye"
to another dude, dawg.

255
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,335
Trip, man. Being a father...

256
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:48,215
And I was talkin' about all the young kids
with their communicating right there.

257
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,259
'Cause I've been married 16 years, man.

258
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:54,013
I been trying. My wife still be tryin'
to keep a hot thing, yeah.

259
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,975
My baby, she a good babe too.

260
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,977
We be tryin' to keep the shit fresh.

261
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,189
So I be tryin' to do the Snapchat,

262
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,525
I tried sexting,
that's what I tried to do.

263
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:11,405
I want sex. I'm on my way home one day.
"Hey, girl. Daddy 'bout to pull up."

264
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,285
"I might wanna dot, dot, dot, dot, dot."

265
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,870

She go text me back, "Pick up some bread."

267
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,129
You know what?

268
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,215
You ain't put no water splash emoji
on there or nothing.

269
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,343
Just "get some goddamn bread." Really?

270
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,598

00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,735
Fuck around. You know.

276
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:53,405
Bullshit. You in college. Bullshit.
C's, D's. She wasn't serious.

277
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,991
Because she my daughter,

280
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,084
I'm like, "What?" "Yeah, I want you
to get me the new Camaro."

281
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:10,214
"The new Camaro? You know, that's
more like A-student shit right there."

282
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:15,677
You more like used Hyundai

285
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,186
"My daughter doin' a'ight, nigga."

286
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,314
"CSU? Nigga, no."

287
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,444
Get you one of them hoverboards,
you can go to the club in one of them.

288
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,745
"Pull up, goddamn."

289
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,086
My son, 15.

290
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,796
Now he on the swim team.

291
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,007
You know, the swim... They be getting you
into different kind of shape.

292
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,636
All of a sudden, my son out of nowhere
got all shoulders and chest.

293
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,013
He walkin' in the house one day.
"What up, Dad?"

294
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,893
I say, "Oh, no, you wanna put all that
shit up when you walk in the house.

295
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,105
Put them shoulders in the closet,
put your chest in the drawer."

296
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:12,109
I ain't gonna have all this walk around
my goddamn house.

297
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,324
Little bitty scrawny ass
motherfucker walk around.

298
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,495
"What up, Dad?"
"No, nigga, put all that up right now.

299
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,124
Hang those shoulders on a hanger
and put 'em in the closet."

300
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:32,212
See, he 15, you know, now,
he try to start dating a little bit.

301
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,007
The thing about my son,
he like the little mix girls.

302
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,636
He like the girls half black, half white.
Little curly hair, that's his thing.

303
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,348
He gonna go out on a date,
he tell me take them to the movies.

304
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,809
I'm like, "Cool."
He hopped in the backseat with her.

305
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,436
I'm like...

306
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:51,773
"When the hell I turn into
a Uber driver, goddamn?

307
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:58,530
I'm Ced the damn Entertainer.
Somebody better get up here with me.

308
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,993
I ain't get ready to be driving
y'all like that now, shit."

309
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:10,417
She a cute little mixed girl.
They come back to the house.

310
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,838
She like, "Let's go to your room
and close the door." I'm like, "Oh, whoa."

311
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:19,301
I say, "Son, that's the white 15
right there that's talking.

312
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,679
You don't get to do that 'round here.

313
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:26,350
You don't get to close damn doors
and shit, no."

314
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,978
She's like, "You tell Cedric it's your
room. You can do that if you want to."

315
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,438
I'm like...

316
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,191
"Tell Cedric"?

317
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:37,569
"Bitch, when you say my name,
put some respect on that shit."

318
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,532
"Put some respect on it.

319
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,494
I ain't gonna say it no more.

320
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,456
Now, is we finished or is we done?"

321
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,210
Okay. I'll trill y'all, shit.

322
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,797
Put some respect on my shit.

323
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,716
"Tell Cedric." What?

324
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:06,098
The truth is they are your little kids.

325
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,851
And they yours, you been raising them,
but you realize your kids do things

326
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,772
you do that you didn't really think
you taught them,

327
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,691
but you gotta deal with it now.

328
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,777
Like the other day, they called me up
to my son's school,

329
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,322
told me my little boy
was up there cussing.

330
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,907
I said, "What?"

331
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,119
They're like, "Yeah,
he here cussing in the school."

332
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,788
I'm like, "My little boy?"

333
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:34,126
They like, "Yeah."
I say, "Oh, no, you know.

334
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,211
What did he say?"

335
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,755
They were like, "He said, 'Shit, damn.'"

336
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,551
I'm like, "'Shit, damn'? In that order?"

337
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,473
They say, "Yeah." I say, "Oh, no.

338
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:53,186
That means the little white kids
are influencing my son, you know.

339
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,732
I mean, hey, he say 'motherfucker'
or 'Fuck that shit, dawg'

340
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,359
or 'We 'bout to blow this bitch up.'

341
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:04,239
Or something like that,
I would have taken responsibility.

342
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:09,786
Everybody know that 'Shit, damn'
is not a part of our culture, okay?

343
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,666
So... thank you so much, okay?"

344
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,461
I'm gonna hop right on top of that.

345
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:22,424
I don't want my son growing up
being no dyslexic cusser like that.

346
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,719
"Shit, damn."

347
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,931
So I'm walkin' him to the car,
mad about the wrong thing.

348
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,851
I'm walking him to the car. "'Shit, damn.'

349
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,812
Really? 'Shit, damn.'

350
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,023
I'm one of the original Kings of Comedy

351
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:42,277
and you up in here talkin' 'bout
some 'shit, damn, damn.'

352
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,904
Get your ass in the car!

353
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,449
You know how to cuss."

354
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:56,291
So you can see where my parenting skills
are off a little bit. You can understand.

355
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,711
"Shit, damn."

356
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,546
Shit is embarrassing.

357
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,468
My little daughter, she 12.

358
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,553
She real intelligent though.

359
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,597
She be asking you questions
you can't answer.

360
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,600
We had people over. I'm there.
We doin' grown-up shit.

361
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,686
We got a little wine goin'.
We in the kitchen laughing, talking.

362
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:20,941
Got company. She gonna walk in.
"Daddy, do animals commit suicide?"

363
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,153
"What?

364
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:30,450
Come on, don't do me like that.
You see these damn people over here.

365
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,787
Don't be asking me shit like that.
I ain't thought of that before.

366
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,124
Do animals commit suicide? Google it.

367
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,918
Shit. Google the shit. I don't know.

368
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,671
Maybe. Maybe, you know."

369
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,841
You ever thought about it? Maybe though.
Maybe?

370
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,927
You ever see a possum dead
on the side of the road?

371
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,849
You ever think that maybe that possum
just was... tired of being a possum?

372
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:58,645
Nigga just... hanging out with the other
possums, like, "You know what?

373
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,442
I don't even give a fuck no more, dawg."

374
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,991
The other possum like,
"Don't walk out on the street, Daryl."

375
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,119
"You can't tell me what to do, Wayne.

376
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,205
I mean, I'm ugly.

377
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,166
Don't nobody like us.

378
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,168
Fuck it."

379
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,090
It got ran over by a Crown Vic on 26th,
this nigga.

380
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,926
Possums standing over him.
"He deader than a motherfucker."

381
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,805
They all like,
♪ How do I ♪

382
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,850
♪ Say good-bye? ♪

383
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,357
"Oh, that dawg, man. We loved Daryl."

384
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,988
Give your kids a goldfish. Have it
in that little tank on the dresser.

385
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:54,534
Leave for two days. Come back.
Goldfish on the dresser, dead.

386
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,411
That's suicide, isn't it?

387
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,040
That goldfish knew there wasn't
no water outside that tank.

388
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,709
But he swim around
that tank for two days like,

389
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:05,212
"Man, this some bullshit, man.

390
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:11,259
I'm a fish. I know I ain't supposed
to go in no circle for three damn days.

391
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,889
You know, that treasure chest
ain't even got shit in it. Fuck it."

392
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,980
Dead. On your dresser.

393
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,565
Suicide.

394
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,282
Know them bugs that run into your
windshield when you driving the highway?

395
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,745
Them bugs know what they doing, nigga.
That's jihad.

396
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,791
Them bugs see your car lights. They like,
"For the love of Allah!"

397
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,295
Suicide.

398
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,761
Wow, last year, man. So much shit
going on. Crazy shit in the news.

399
00:25:54,844 --> 00:26:00,267
I saw this shit on the news. Threw me off.
This lady, 55, just had a baby.

400
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,479
I was like, "Damn. That's pretty late
be havin' a damn baby."

401
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,899
But don't get me wrong, if you 55
and wanna have a baby,

402
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,818
go on ahead, have a damn baby.

403
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,988
I just find it rude and inconsiderate,
personally.

404
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,992
You gotta think about this. You 55.

405
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,412
That means she already
got kids that got kids.

406
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,247
When they go visit grandmama,

407
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,582
they gotta deal with
their little aunt or uncle.

408
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,970
You gotta be thinkin' about it.
That gotta be fucked up. You eight, nine.

409
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,681
You go to your grandmama's house
to go play...

410
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,435
Here come this little motherfucker,
"Hey, unh-unh, whoa, whoa!

411
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,687
Where you think you goin'?

412
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,440
No, pick me up, take me upstairs
and change my diaper.

413
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,776
Then you can go outside. I'm sorry, what?

414
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,238
I'm your little uncle,
that's who I am, goddamn it, shit.

415
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,450
Put that on Disney Channel,
put something in my sippy cup,

416
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,828
then you can go outside,
but other than that... come again?

417
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,290
I'm your little uncle,
that's who I am, motherfucker.

418
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,460
Your mama's my sister.
Respect the hierarchy around here, shit.

419
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:12,422
Don't give a damn how old I am."

420
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,091
Fucking little-ass uncle.

421
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,469
What a trip, man.

422
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,930
Saw this shit too. I saw Lamar Odom...
God bless Lamar Odom.

423
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:24,934
I'm glad I saw him. He doin' a'ight,
but that was a little scary.

424
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:29,105
The scary thing... it let me know
I'd been out the game for a long time.

425
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,817
Scary thing, I was glad he was all right,
but when shit hit the news,

426
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,029
told me he had spent $75,000
for two chicks,

427
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,073
I was like, "Ooh! When I was...

428
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:43,787
I kinda... I kinda been out of the game
for a while.

429
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,332
This nigga seemed to raise the Blue Book
on these bitches right here.

430
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,000
Nigga, that's...

431
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,503
That's...

432
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,215
That's pretty expensive."

433
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,595
As soon as he did that, at your local
strip club, all the girls went up.

434
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,473
They heard them girls got 35,000 a piece.

435
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,101
They was like, "Unh-unh, table dances...

436
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,978
Table dances is $80, Latrell."

437
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,027
That my black stripper dance right here.

438
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,039
You be, "Hey, baby, let me get a piece
of gum." "I ain't chewing no gum."

439
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,546
"Wait. You not chewing gum right now?"
"No, motherfucker...

440
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,632
This how you do the dance, nigga."

441
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,682
"So you sayin' you not chewing gum
right now."

442
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,018
"No, motherfucker, I'm in my job.

443
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,439
Do you chew gum at your job?"

444
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,196
All I know is that shit make me want
some gum like a motherfucker.

445
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,286
That's the difference too.

446
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,539
'Cause you go down South,
they got that shake-a-booty style.

447
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,792
I live in LA. They got
the more corporate strip club...

448
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,919
It's all about the up-top game.

449
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,714
There, the girl's like,
"Oh, my God, how are you?

450
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,303
Yeah. Yeah.

451
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:27,223
Yeah, you like that? You like that?"

452
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,684
"Uh, no, not really, baby."

453
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:35,190
Brothers, we be wanting
that goddamn bass, nigga.

454
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,610
You go there, you be seeing...
You come down here...

455
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,945
I went to Atlanta one time, saw a girl...

456
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:45,325
Her ass was so fat, I thought I had on
3-D glasses, nigga. I was, "Ooh!

457
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,328
Ooh, I gotta take these off!
That's too close.

458
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,081
Ooh, that's givin' me a headache.
Is that too close for you?"

459
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,043
I can't wear these.
I can't wear these and look at her.

460
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,881
'Cause they got that shake-a-booty style.
That style right there.

461
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:06,095
You ever notice, once you a stripper
and do the shake-a-booty style,

462
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,680
you can't stop doing it.

463
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,558
Anybody know somebody that
used to strip and don't no more?

464
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,269
They'll just do this shit
in regular life sometimes.

465
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,399
They be at the bank
about to cash their check.

466
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:23,154
You be behind them with your check like...

467
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:28,952
"You know what, give me that
in all ones, my nigga, a'ight?

468
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:33,540
I didn't know y'all was doing it
like that up in here today."

469
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,211
They're doing it big.

470
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,881
No, it's a condition.
They don't know they doing it.

471
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:44,467
It's something like stripper Tourette's.

472
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,719
The stripper Tourette's.
You don't know you're doing it.

473
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,472
You don't strip no more.
You have moved on in life.

474
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,767
You got your real estate license
and everything, you know.

475
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,689
But don't let your song happen to come on.

476
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,149
It's just a... You can't help it.

477
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,443
Even in your mind you might hear your song

478
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,820
and just do stripper shit.

479
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,281
They be about to check out
at the grocery lane

480
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,783
and don't even know
they doing stripper shit. Boop.

481
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,537
Boop.

482
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,747
"Excuse me. These two-for-one?

483
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,250
That's what I thought. Okay." Boop. Boop.

484
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,961
"Twan, put that down.
You can't have that. Unh-unh."

485
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,213
"Y'all take coupons?

486
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,675
Oh, good. I'm about to make it
rain in this motherfucker."

487
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:28,177
♪ I'm-a drop it down, pick it up
Twerk this ass ♪

488
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,305

Rain come down ♪

490
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:43,401
Little kid's like,
"Mama, what is you doing?"

491
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,946
Like, "Ooh, baby. Mama got to
get home and take a No-strip-itol.

492
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,157
I got to take...

493
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,242
400 milligrams of No-strip-itol.

494
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,036
I've got a condition.

495
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,831
I need my medication."

496
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,963
I'm feeling good, man.
I just had a birthday.

497
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,218
Wow, man.

498
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,972
You get old and you don't
even realize it. You feel good.

499
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,515
But when you get older,

500
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,936
you know you getting older
'cause old shit happen to you.

501
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,063
Like, in your mind, you still young.

502
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,524
But then you be doing regular life
and some old shit happen to you,

503
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,485
like, "Ooh, I'm older than a mofo."

504
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:30,239
Like you be pouring cereal
and your knee go out. "Oh! Shit.

505
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,541
Mmm.

506
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,838
I'm gonna have to stop fucking
with these Honey Nut Cheerios, nigga...

507
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,467
if that's going to happen every time."

508
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,140
Dude, we got one little move
that we know we old.

509
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,643
When we can't just step
into the car no more.

510
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,646
You know your ass old
when you leave like this.

511
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,065
"All right, I'm gonna holler at y'all.

512
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,408
Tell you mama Roosevelt came by here."

513
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,623
Your ass old, nigga.

514
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,255
I know I'm old
'cause I got old-ass friends.

515
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,674
It ain't got shit to do with me.

516
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,011
I feel good, but my friends be old
and doing old shit.

517
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,471
I'm like, "Damn.
I'm one of y'all, ain't I?"

518
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,935
Idiots in the club arguing over
blood pressure medicine and shit.

519
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:45,982
"Would you stop talking about
your damn prescriptions in the club?"

520
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:49,444
We at a club, my boy taking
his pills, girl walk up to him,

521
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,446
"Is that a Molly? Can I get one?"

522
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,949
I'm like, "Girl, you better not
take that shit right there.

523
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:59,537
Your goddamn glucose level's
gonna go up so high. Don't. No.

524
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,456
No. Don't.

525
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,376
Don't take that shit he on, baby."

526
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,256
My boy, he's trying to be hip.

527
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,551
He trying to be on social media.
His old ass.

528
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,970
Talking about "Follow me @Willy Earl."

529
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,643
Man, ain't nobody gonna follow
nobody named Mr. Willy Earl

530
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,937
on goddamn Instagram.

531
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,191
Goddamn. Mr. Willy Earl.

532
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,446
He in the club
with some damn shape-ups on.

533
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,993
So every time he stop, he just
rocking for no reason, nigga.

534
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,338
"Man, there's a few of them
in here tonight, ain't it?"

535
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,802
"Nigga, if you don't stop
all that damn rocking."

536
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,888
"I can't help it.
It's the shoes, you know.

537
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:01,849
Joe Montana wear these right here."

538
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,980
He's 60-something.

539
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,442
He won't tell us how old he is.

540
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,986
He had downloaded his damn...

541
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:18,116
He got an iPhone 6 and downloaded
his music on there for ringtones.

542
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,700
I'm like, "Willy Earl,

543
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:24,205
come on, man, don't put those
old-ass records on there, man."

544
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,333
A ringtone for young people, man.
You ain't supposed to...

545
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,545
When your phone rings, it supposed
to be some cool shit come on.

546
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:34,340
♪ Fuck up some commas
Fuck up some commas, yeah ♪

547
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,677
Sure enough, we in a club,

550
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,316

551
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,069
I ain't know you could download
Latimore, man."

552
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,739
He gonna answer his phone,
"Hello. This is Willy Earl.

553
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,700
Uh-huh.

554
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,536
Uh-huh.

00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,498
Yes. Where did you find me?

556
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,918
On WillyEarl.com? Okay, thank you."

557
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,754
Oh, damn old ass.

558
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:18,551
Like I say, he's 60-something, man,
but he got a girlfriend like 28, 29.

559
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,597
He be bragging too, like,
"Hey, boy, hey."

560
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:28,019
"Hey, boy, I'm still out there
in the game, boy, you know?

561
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,354
I'm picking 'em up
and I'm putting 'em down.

562
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,356
I get it like I live. You know?

563
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,860
I told the bitch 'If I got four quarters,
I couldn't call it.' You know?"

564
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:42,533
He trying to keep up
with that young-ass girl.

565
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:46,037
He got a pocketful of Viagras
and Cialis and Levitras.

566
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,207
Nigga just eating them all day
like they sunflower seeds.

567
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,794
"I'll stay ready so I ain't
got to get ready."

568
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:03,930
He be offering them to you like they
Altoids. "You want a Cialis, my nigga?

569
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,015
No? All right."

570
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:09,685
I caught him one day
with a Cialis sweetheart necklace on.

571
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,155
"Trying to find one of my Levitras."

572
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,453
Got this damn election going on.

573
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:30,998
Boy. Goddamn Donald Trump, man.

574
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,209
He's an ignorant little motherfucker.

575
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,713
Like he's been eating Cheetos
and just rubbed it on his face.

576
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,344
I ain't never seen a tan
that goddamn orange.

577
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,889
This fool talking about
he gonna build a wall

578
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,683
to stop the Mexicans from coming in.

579
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,268
Come on, Donald.

580
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,728
Nobody gonna stop no damn
people from Mexico

581
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:53,980
with no damn wall.

582
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:58,526
We already see El Chapo.
We know they doing tunnels already.

583
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,321
Plus, I just was in Mexico.

584
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,282
They heard we were gonna build a wall.

585
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,785
Everybody in Mexico practicing already,
getting ready to come here.

586
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,162
Everybody heard we were building a wall.

587
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:11,580
They down there getting ready.

588
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:15,001
As soon as we build a wall,
everybody learning how to pole vault.

589
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:20,506
What a wall gonna be... 15-, 16-feet tall?

590
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,384
Them niggas on the other side
of the wall like this.

591
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,595
¡rale!

592
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,896
"17'2", motherfucker!"

593
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:44,238
He's on the other side like,
"Throw the stick back, homes!

594
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,951
Fucking Hector, you took
the stick with you, bro."

595
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,496
This motherfucker here.

596
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,749
And I don't know who be voting for him.

597
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,500
Anybody in here... A show of hands.

598
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,794
Who be voting for Donald Trump? Anybody?

599
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,629
Nobody ever say it.

600
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,632
One motherfucker. There's Trump.
There go Trump, dude.

601
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,384
There's got to be one.

602
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,346
Every time he win, it be
a thousand people voting for Trump.

603
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,556
And I'd be like, "Who the fuck?"

604
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:16,062
'Cause every time I see he won,
it's just surprising as like

605
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:18,731
seeing your one girl cousin
that dress like a boy,

606
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,442
but she show up
at the family reunion pregnant.

607
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,280
Everybody like, "Who the fuck
is fucking Mr. Cynthia?"

608
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,370
I can't figure it out. Who?

609
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,833
I think Hillary want to win
just so she can get Bill back.

610
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,045
She going to be in the Oval Office
with somebody under her desk,

611
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,422
nigga, like,

612
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,925
"I'm the captain now!

613
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,888
Look at me. I'm the captain now."

614
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,227
Everybody think they can do
what Barack did, man.

615
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,938
They gonna come in
and just try to do their job.

616
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,564
Barack did his thing, man.

617
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,150
Barack did his thing, man.

618
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,863
As the president,
if they keep fucking with him,

619
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:11,325
I don't know if he gonna make it
all the way to the end.

620
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,413
Barack might quit like that black lady
did on the news. Remember?

621
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:20,251
Wake up one day, go, "Fuck this shit!
I ain't going through this shit."

622
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:24,338
Just leave. I know he ain't gonna
put on no suit that last day.

623
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,757
That last day,
Barack ain't gonna put on no suit.

624
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,427
He gonna walk to that helicopter
in Jordan flip-flops

625
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,390
with his hat backwards,
wave cap on, nigga.

626
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,268
"Michelle, Sasha, Malia, y'all coming?

627
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,564
Oh, get some of those sheets.
I like that thread count on that shit."

628
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,902
I don't know why they be messing
with that man like that, man.

629
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:50,281
Barack, he the only one who really
could have been the first black president.

630
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,492
For real. Look around. I mean,
look at yourselves. Come on, now.

631
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,621
We like to fight too much.
Everybody in this room be like...

632
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,458
We can't have nobody say shit about us.

633
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,209
Barack be holding that shit in.

634
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,629
Every now and then,
that negro do show up though.

635
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,048
Black people see it.
We see it first.

636
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,135
We like,
"Ooh, there it is. He about to trip."

637
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:19,935
Not long ago, he was talking about
I've done all I can do with this and that.

638
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,604
"Right, 'cause you can't go again!"

639
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,399
Barack was like, "Because
I won 'em all, fuck, boy, pussy."

640
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,654
You got to listen to the tape slow.

641
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,156
You got to play it real slow.

642
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,451
"Fuck, boy, pussy, nigga,
I won everything.

643
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,870
Just saying."

644
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,873
Like, damn, Barack. Motherfucking thug.

645
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,293
I don't know why they
be talking about he soft.

646
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:46,045
Barack been taken some serious folks out.

647
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,422
I'm talking about Osama bin Laden, merked.

648
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,842
Muammar Gaddafi, merked.

00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,970
All the Somalia pirates, done.

650
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:59,099
Shit. Barack got to fuck around
and get some tattoo tears, nigga, shit.

651
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,148

That's what everybody kind of think.
It's about the country music down here.

00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,954

Didn't even know
I was doing the shit, dawg.

684
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,878
I caught myself in the mirror,
nigga, just...

685
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,799
That's the other thing too...
you be down South,

686
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,428
you get outside, like, the city limit
you get into that little country area,

687
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,556
you'll run into some of them
good old boys out there, man.

They be corn-fed, cock-strong
motherfucking boys.

Been lifting baby bulls since
they was six-years-old and shit.

those baby bulls in my pickup truck."

692
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,406
"All right, Daddy."

693
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,660
Before they're six, with one arm,
throwing a bull up in a truck.

694
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,167
And them mothers will fight your ass too.

695
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,710
That's the thing about it.

696
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,962
Black people, we think
just 'cause we born black

697
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,547
we can beat up white dudes.

698
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,676
In our minds, we like, "White boy,
I'll beat your motherfucking ass.

699
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,095
You better go on with that bullshit, boy."

700
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:43,972
You don't do that shit
in the country, man.

701
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,434
Trying to tell you that shit ain't
gonna go like you think at all.

Let's go, bubba, let's do it, baby!"

705
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:02,032
You be like, "Everybody just need
to calm down for a second. Listen.

706
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:05,577
Listen, is it Trevor?
It's Trevor, right? Is it Trevor?

I ain't trying to get Bobby Boucher
down this bitch.

710
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,091
It's totally different than black country.

711
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:22,052
Black country is a whole 'nother
dialogue altogether.

712
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,637
I got some country-ass cousins...

713
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,682
It's fast and it's country
and it all ran together.

714
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,892
You don't know what the fuck
they be saying.

715
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,688
I got a cousin excited to see me.
Every time he see me, "Hey, coz.

716
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,607
Hey..."

717
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,901
"Huh?"

718
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,446
"Hey..."

719
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:50,247
"Hey..."

720
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:54,293
"Why you like...
Goddamn it."

721
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,630
"What?

722
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:05,179
I'm gonna need closed captions
for your ass, nigga. I don't have...

723
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,973
I have no idea what you just said,
motherfucker."

724
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:12,853
Trip is, I'm talking to one of my cousin's
friends, he talk faster than him.

725
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,521
He walk up and introduce himself.

726
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,316
"Charles Johnson. Everybody
around here call me 'Bominicious.'

727
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:19,443
Everybody around here call me
Bominicious. It's fine.

728
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,863
You call me that. Don't even worry
about it. Everybody call me Bominicious."

729
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,032
"Everybody call you 'Bominicious'"?

730
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,535
"Yeah, everybody in the whole city
call me Bominicious. Don't worry.

731
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,787
You can call me that.
Don't worry about it."

732
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,331
"That's what everybody calls you?"

733
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,249
"Yeah, everybody calls me that."

734
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,169
So I'm like, "All right."
So all week long...

735
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,297
my ass talking about,
"Bominicious, what up, boy?"

736
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,301
"Hey, Bominicious, you gonna come
over here watch the game with us?"

737
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,304
"Hey, Bominicious, run to the store,
grab some beer, come on back."

738
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,431
My coz said, "What'd you call him?"

739
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,318
"Bominicious.

740
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:05,155
He said everybody called him Bominicious.
It's all right for me to call him that."

741
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,407
"No, man, his name is C.J."

742
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,163
He saying, "You can call me
by my initials." That's what he saying.

743
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,220
C.J.

744
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:31,515
I been calling that boy
Bominicious all week.

745
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:35,060
"By my initials," is what he's saying.

746
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,149
This shit is embarrassing.

747
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,487
"Why you ain't say nothing?
You heard me call you Bominicious."

748
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,908
"I couldn't understand you.
I ain't know what you talking about."

749
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:54,830
"You couldn't understand me?
Okay. All right. All right.

750
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,959
Okay. I deserve that."

751
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:02,296
We had a little wild-ass year.
We had a wild-ass year.

752
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:06,008
Lot of little stars was getting, like,
locked up in the last couple of years.

753
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,011
Little Chris Brown in and out of jail.

754
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:10,762
Little Chris Brown
finally got it together.

755
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,724
That mofo get locked up,
get out of jail, get locked up,

756
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:17,227
threw a rock at his mama's car,
went back to jail, got locked up.

757
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,522
Little nigga gonna learn...
♪ These jails ain't loyal, nigga ♪

758
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,568
Wesley Snipes had to go to jail
couple of years ago.

759
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:29,197
Passenger 57 was inmate 135267.
He was locked up.

760
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:33,577
Ron Isley had to go to jail.
Even Mr. Bigg was in the big house.

761
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:37,623
I heard somebody, "Oh, Lord. Jesus!"
No, he fine, baby. He out.

762
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,667
She go, "Oh, Lord!"
No, he okay. He all right.

763
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,919
Matter of fact, he in the studio right now

764
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:46,006
doing a remix to Akon's song "Locked Up."

765
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,592
But doing it Ron Isley style.

766
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,303
So you know that shit buttery
than a motherfucker, nigga.

767

"Locked Up" remix. Buttery as hell.

776
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,509
I been feeling good, man, you know.

777
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,804
Trying, you know,
to take care of yourself.

778
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:36,139
Got to take care of yourself, man.

779
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:40,394
You know, everybody all upset.
Everybody all angry.

780
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,771
The world is angry as hell,
for good reason.

781
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,773
Lot of bullshit going on out there.

782
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,943
Like all this year, all the violence
where police were killing kids.

783
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,486
I got a little boy, man.

784
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,488
I'm concerned about this shit.

785
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:55,117
Like police will just shoot
a little black kid.

786
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,495
Same motherfucker will jump
in a raging river to save a dog.

787
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,289
That's why every time my boy
leave the house, I'm like,

788
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,792
"Take the puppy with you, nigga.
That's all I know."

789
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:10,257
He's walking around with a Yorkie
on a goddamn key chain.

790
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,384
"I'll just take him with me."

791
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,971
All I know is black Labs' lives
matter, nigga. I've know that.

792
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:21,226
I had to defend my dawg
couple times in the year... Steve Harvey.

793
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,103
I had to come to his defense.

794
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:26,523
First, about the Miss Universe shit.
Everybody was upset about it.

795
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:30,694
I called him that night. I had to hit him
with the Menace II Society.

796
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,904
I'm like, "You know you fucked up, right?

797
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,198
You know you fucked up?

798
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,784
You fucked up. You fucked up."

799
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,332
But a couple of months before that,
people was mad at him

800
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:48,712
'cause he put Paula Deen on his talk show,
and everybody was mad, man.

801
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,590
"Ced, why your boy got Paula Deen
on the talk show?"

802
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,968
First of all, it's a talk show,
motherfucker. Hold on.

803
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:56,762
Somebody got to be on there talking.

804
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:01,475
Give him a minute, you know.
But I get it. I understand.

805
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,060
Black people, we were mad
'cause Paula Deen, you know,

806
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,439
real, on the low, we mad
Paula Deen said the N-word.

807
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:10,525
'Cause, on the low,
we fucks with Paula Deen.

808
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,403
'Cause Paula Deen cook
the way we like shit.

809
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:17,783
So it kind of hurt us when
Paula Deen said the N-word at all.

810
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:19,326
When Paula Deen be on TV, she like,

811
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:22,996
"First, I'm gonna take some biscuits,
then put them in the oven,

812
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,249
and I'm gonna take some butter
and put that on top of there,

813
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,044
and then take some bacon
and crumble it on top

814
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,922
and melt some cheese all over it.

815
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:35,383
And we'll take some gravy
and sop it up through there."

816
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,804
We be in the house like, "Oh, shit!

817
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:44,267
God damn, Paula Deen, that shit
sounds good as a motherfucker there!"

818
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,979
That's why it hurt us when she
said it. God damn, Paula Deen.

819
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,858
When you think about it, anybody
cook a sweet potato pie that good,

820
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,361
got to say nigga
every now and then, you know.

821
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:57,614
But I ain't talking about
no egregious-ass shit.

822
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,033
When you first taste it
to make sure it's good.

823
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:03,537
You like, "Nigga! Yeah.

824
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,796
Nigga.

825
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,883
Might want to get you a little piece
of that right there, boy.

826
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:19,636
Nigga.

827
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,393
Nigga."

828
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:31,481
Animals all mad and shit.

829
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,651
So much shit going on,
like, animals are upset.

830
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,821
Rightly so.
In Ohio, a couple of years ago,

831
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:41,491
this dude had, like, a zoo at his house
with real zoo animals.

832
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,828
He got up one day and let 'em go
in a regular-ass neighborhood.

833
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:46,663
"Hyah! Get on out of here!

834
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:49,082
Hyah! Hyah! Go on now!"

835
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:54,588
That ain't for black people
right there, that shit.

836
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,717
This nigga had lions and tigers
and bears, oh, my!

837
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,013
You know us. We scared
when somebody's dog get loose.

838
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,016
I couldn't even imagine walking
through a Walmart parking lot

839
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,642
and seeing a loose-ass lion.

840
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,311
Nigga, you like...

841
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,608
"Is that a lion, nigga?

842
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,611
Don't move! Don't move!

843
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,406
I heard you ain't supposed to move."

844
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,035
You be coming up with all kinds of shit.

845
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:28,705
I don't even know what you supposed
to do you see a loose-ass lion.

846
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,498
Somebody talk about "Run!"

847
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,585
Nigga, your ass can't outrun no damn lion.

848
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:39,341
I don't know about y'all, but I would
try to Jedi mind-trick that motherfucker.

849
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:43,595
If I saw a loose-ass lion,
I would turn into a lion tamer.

850
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:47,682
That lion came at me, I'll be like,
"Ha! Sit, Abar!

851
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,646
I am Cedric!

852
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,858
Hup! Sit!"

853
00:53:57,984 --> 00:54:02,280
The lion would be looking at me,
"Do I know you, motherfucker?"

854
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,158
"I'm just trying not to get ate, Lion.

855
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,828
Doing the best I can, you know."

856
00:54:10,538 --> 00:54:12,666
Saw this shit on YouTube the other day.

857
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,752
This lady was at the zoo
and got kicked by a giraffe.

858
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:21,299
I don't know what your ass did
to make a giraffe mad.

859
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,593
Do you know how irritating
your ass gotta be

860
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:26,846
for a giraffe to haul off
and kick the shit out of you?

861
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:31,893
Giraffe is usually one of the cooler
animals at the damn zoo.

862
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:37,232
They all long and lanky.
Be walking around like a ballplayer.

863
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:41,695
They got the eyelashes
that's all fleek and shit, nigga.

864
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,198
I don't know what this lady said,

865
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:48,243
but that giraffe had had enough
of her ass.

866
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,495
She up and said something,
that giraffe went like,

867
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,289
"Bitch, shut the fuck up!"

868
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:58,086
But he knew he had fucked up,
so that nigga ran off and shit.

869
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:08,722
He tried to mix in
with the other giraffes and shit.

870
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,433
They going, "We see your ass, Dwayne.

871
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:14,352
You know damn well
you weren't supposed to kick that lady."

872
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:22,152
And chickens have had a hard
couple of years. Ooh.

873
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,822
It's got to be rough if you a damn chicken
when you think about it.

874
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:29,284
'Cause chickens, man,
we love damn chicken.

875
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:34,539
So if you a chicken, you can't be out
on the farm making plans and shit.

876
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:37,500
Talking about, "Yeah, I think next
Saturday we should all get together

877
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,127
and go over to Reggie's house..."

878
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,254
Nigga, you going to be
86ed Wednesday.

879
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:44,257
Your ass ain't gonna make it
to goddamn Saturday.

880
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:47,385
You gonna be on somebody's grill,
dawg.

881
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,807
There's been a lot of controversy
around chicken.

882
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:56,102
The last couple of years...
It started with the Chick-fil-A man.

883
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,314
The Chick-fil-A man didn't
want gay people to eat chicken.

884
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,316
He made a statement and everything.

885
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,277
"Your ass gay, don't come over here
and eat no motherfucking chicken."

886
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,864
I could be paraphrasing.
I could be off a little bit.

887
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,784
But I believe it's an exact quote
if you look it up.

888
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,536
"Don't bring your punk ass here
to eat no goddamn chicken."

889
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,206
I could be off by a word or two,

890
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,458
but I believe it's somewhere
right in there.

891
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,044
He's like, "Don't bring
your punk ass over here

892
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,380
try to eat no goddamn chicken
up in here, is what I'm saying."

893
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,175
Damn, Chick-fil-A man, that's aggressive.

894
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,721
Black people, we had to deal
with it a couple of years ago

895
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,848
with, you know, Mary J. Blige.

896
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,601
She ended up singing
the chicken song for Burger King

897
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,228
and that kind of offended us.

898
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,107
Well, one, that's a stereotype
that we love chicken.

899
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,858
You know. And we do.

900
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:49,614
We just don't want no motherfucker
singing about that shit though.

901
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,907
It's already hard enough.

902
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,660
We can't eat watermelon
at the company picnic, nigga.

903
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:55,662
We be at the company picnic like,

904
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,998
"You know damn well y'all waiting on me
to get that goddamn watermelon.

905
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,500
I ain't doing that."

906
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,752
You like, "Trevor, put some watermelon
on your plate

907
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,963
and bring that shit over here for me, man.

908
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,631
I ain't doing that shit."

909
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,801
I wasn't even really upset that
Mary J. had sang about chicken.

910
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:13,763
I was more upset that she Mary J. Bliged
the shit more than anything.

911
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,098

916
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:34,242
When I found out she got paid
$2 million to sing that song,

917
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,286
I was like, "Shit."

918
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,997
Somebody going to ask me,
"Ced, would you do that shit?

919
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,999
Sell out like that
for $2 million?"

920
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,917
I'm like, "Nigga, for $2 million,

921
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,671
I'll sing the song as Mary J. Blige,
nigga."

922
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:49,966
I'm talking about boots on and everything.

923
