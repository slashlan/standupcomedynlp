190
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,526
My whole life, I always wanted
to be able to do a flip.

Wouldn't that be great?

192
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,280
I was always growing up, going,
"Man, I've got to get a flip going.

193
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,283
Everybody will love me
if I could just do a flip."

194
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,785
Everybody would be like,
"Whoa, did you see the Sandman?

195
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,370
He popped out a flip."

196
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,457
I just wanted to be
in a fucking Marshalls or something,

197
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,876
buying some cheap clothes
and going, "Hey, watch this."

198
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,795

the fucking lady at the cash register go,

199
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,881
"Did you fucking see
that kid with the flip?"

200
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,050
I'd be like. "Hey, I do it all the time."

201
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,553
But I never got that one down, man.
I wish I did.

202
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,348
Always I was like--
I didn't know how to fucking practice.

203
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,599
That was the problem.

204
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:41,062
I didn't know how to do my first try.
I would always get to right about here,

205
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,231
and then go, "Ah, I don't know.
I'm gonna get hurt."

206
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,192
And when I got older, I wanted to learn
how to speak fluent Italian too.

207
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,777
And I did that. I mastered that.

208
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,613
So, I'm in Italy,
and I meet the Pope himself,

209
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,365
and in fluent Italian, I say to him,

210
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,617
"Hey, I love what you've done
for the Church.

211
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,827

for the world.

Am I getting into heaven?"

215
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,752
And in Italian he says,
"Can you do a flip?"

216
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,713
And I was like, "Madonne!"

who rescues too many animals

220
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,304
and, like, never can do anything?

221
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,557
"Hey, you want to go out
in a couple days?"

222
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,642
"Ah, no, my chicken's eye fell out

223
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,353
and I've got to paste it back on."

224
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:24,272
"Oh, okay. That shouldn't take that long."

225
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,108
"Well, one of the ducks,
she isn't quacking, so...

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,949
Hello.

540
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,450
You ever...

541
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,619
How about the times you wake up...

542
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,454
Ever wake up like 4:30 in the morning

543
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,165
and you're like, "God damn it.
What am I doing up right now?"

544
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,001
4:30, can't fall asleep...

545
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,752
I'm fucking ruined for the day.

546
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,630
Ever do one of those things where you go,
"Let me just get out of bed,"

547
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,050
and live like those people who always go,
"Hey, I get up at 4:30 every day.

548
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,844
I do that for me. That's me time.

549
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,470
I spend the morning alone.

550
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,807
That's my time and it's the best.
It sets me in the right mood."

551
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,934
You're like, "Let me be
one of those fucking pricks.

552
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,394
I'll get up at 4:30."

553
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,105
And you get up at 4:30
and you make yourself breakfast.

554
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:57,899
You're like, "Wow, this is good.
making breakfast. I never do that."

555
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,151
And then you work out.

556
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,986
You're like, "I'm working out this early.

557
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,113
Holy shit. That's out of the way.
That's great."

558
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,490
And then you have yourself
another breakfast.

559
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,076
You're like,
"Okay, I'm running out of shit to do."

560
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,580
And then you flip on the news and you go,
"There's news before the news?

561
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,040
Who the fuck are these people?

562
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,584
They're very good.
They should be on the real news."

563
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,170
Then you go outside
and you see a bird eating a worm.

564
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,963
You're like,
"Is that the fucking early bird?

565
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,883
I've been hearing about that thing
for a long time."

566
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,343
There he is. Holy shit."

567
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,553
Then a bus shows up,
and your kids get on it.

568
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,931
You're like, "That's how they fucking
get to school. Nobody fucking told me...

569
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,933
What a day. This is interesting."

570
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:36,688
And then it's around 11 o'clock
and you're in the middle of a work meeting

571
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,816
and you're like, "How long
is this fucking day gonna go for?

572
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,526
Let me sleep!"

573
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,694

00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:48,075

she turned 101 years old,

00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,494

00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,583
My daughter's got that great life.

579
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,543
My family, we fucking die...

580
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:02,547
I should be dead is all I'm saying.
It makes no sense that I'm here right now.

581
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,257
But 101 years old...

582
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,928
I went to her birthday,
I gave her 101 punches in the shoulder...

583
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,639
Just, she kept going, "Ooh."

584
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:14,101
And I was saying, "It's tradition.
We can't break tradition, Grandma."

585
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,728
She was like, "I want to break tradition."

586
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:20,357
I was like, "Well, you can't.
So, just fucking deal with 94 more."

587
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,109
And bam. "Oh!"

'cause...

683
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,916
what are the chances of catching that?

684
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,835
But my dick doesn't look...

685
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,339
as good as I want it to look in the image.

686
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:57,550
Plus, you know,
the fucking ghost was really tall,

687
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,470
so he made my dick not look... exact.

688
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:04,641
Plus the fucking ghost was holding a ruler
next to my dick.

689

I was like, "What the fuck
is your problem?" to the ghost.

Very nice, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

930
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,711
[cheers and applause]

931
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,717
So I'll tell you a little story
about Disney World.

932
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,594
You want to hear
a true Adam Sandler Story?

933
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,930
-Please, I can-- Okay.
-[cheers and applause]

934
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,474
So you guys have been
to Disney World, right?

935
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,643
-[cheering]
-The families have been there.

936
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,438
Who doesn't have kids
and still goes to Disney World?

937
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,273
[cheering]

938
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:39,483
You fucking stoners.

939
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,402
-[laughter]
-I'm on to you.

940
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,362
[laughs]

941
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,990
All right, so I go
to Disney World recently

942
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,826
with my wife and the two kids.

943
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,037
My kids wanted
to go on this roller coaster.

944
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,414
They were very excited.
So, we wait on the line.

945
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,374
We're waiting.
You know the lines are very long.

946
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,376
So, it takes like an hour and 15 minutes.

947
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,211
We get to the front of the line,

948
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:03,966
and then the roller coaster, we find out,
only takes three people at a time.

949
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,593
So, there's four of us.

950
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,511
And I see my wife and the two kids

951
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,972
just immediately start walking
to the thing.

952
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,850
And I was like, we're not even
gonna flip a coin. Not--

953
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,603
Not even a thought, right?
They're like, "No, no..."

954
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,896
I was like, "Yeah. All right."

955
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,732
And so, I'm sitting there very angry.
I'm stewing.

956
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,276
Like, "I waited a fucking hour
and 15 minutes

957
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,488
to go on this fucking shit with you guys,
and you fucking bail on me."

958
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:29,992
Then I see it happens to some other dad
from Oklahoma, and he's muttering.

959
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,162
He's like, "Goddamn motherfucker...
They're mean as shit.

960
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,622
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah."

961
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,248
And then I say to the other dad,

962
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,793
I go, "You want fucking me and you
to go on it together?

963
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,420
And he's like, "What?"
I go, "Well, I'm not going alone.

964
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,381
Let's fucking do this shit.
I'll go with you."

965
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,175
And he's like,
"Yeah, whatever the fuck you want."

966
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,676
And so... [laughs]

967
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,305
So I get on the roller coaster
with the guy

968
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,973
and we're both not talking to each other.

969
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,892
The roller coaster takes off,

970
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,061
and you know how they take off
so fucking fast...

971
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,231
that both our necks snap back,
and we look at each other.

972
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,607
And he's like "Ooh, that got me."

973
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,026
I was like, "Oh, yeah,
that was fucked up, man."

974
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,528
We start laughing a little bit.

975
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,738
And we're fucking
all of a sudden loosening up.

976
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,742
And we're fucking doing all the-- jetting,
banging into these fucking crazy turns.

977
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,453
I'm fucking leaning,
100% leaning on the guy.

978
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:18,249
He's looking at me like, "What the fuck?"
I was like, "Hey, here we are."

979
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,126
And we're laughing our asses off.

980
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:24,046
And I'm like, "Holy shit, I haven't been
this happy in at least 11 years.

981
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,008
I know that, but whatever,
I'm fucking... jetting around,

982
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,260
fucking doing loop-the-loops.

983
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,636
He's fucking bumping my first.

984
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,847
I'm like, "Yeah, motherfucker."
He's like, "Yeah, baby."

985
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,473
We get to the end. The fucking--

986
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,350
You know how the break
comes out of nowhere.

987
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,478
It fucking screeches on,
both our fucking heads snap again.

988
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,940
He's like, "They got us again.
I was like, "Fuck yeah, we'll never learn.

989
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,733
[laughter]

990
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:49,113
So, uh, we're creeping up
to, you know, getting off the ride,

991
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,739
how it's like a little slow at exit,

992
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,992
and we're sitting there,
and I'm fucking...

993
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,453
I feel this crazy pain in my heart,

994
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,582
and I'm like, "Did I fucking fall in love
with this guy or some shit?

995
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,791
What happened?

996
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,502
And he's not looking at me.
I'm like this guy feels it too,

997
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,588
'cause he's in a fucking daze.
We're both--

998
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,674
And my kids are like,
"Come on, let's go to Peter Pan."

999
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,426
I was like, "All right, in a minute."

1000
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,178
I'm yelling at the kids too loud.

1001
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,221
"I've got to say goodbye to the man."

1002
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,431
And, uh...

1003
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,766
I get off. I go, "Hey, nice to meet you."

1004
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,727
He's like, "Yeah, nice to meet you."

1005
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,979
He won't look at me,
and we're both all fucked up.

1006
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,523
He goes back to his family,
I go back to mine.

1007
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:25,816
I'm walking away.

1008
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,736
In my head, I'm like, "I'm never gonna see
that fucking guy again,

1009
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,821
and I don't feel good about that.

1010
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,739
Um...

1011
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,491
And then I...

1012
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,992
And then I go...

1013
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,495
"They take your picture though...

1014
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,246
on those rides.

1015
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,665
You know, just for memory's sake.

1016
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:45,169
Just, what the fuck, I'm gonna go see,
maybe they snapped us, maybe they didn't.

1017
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,838
But if they did... why not?
Fuck it, you know. Let's just see."

1018
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,340
And so, we...

1019
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,841
We go to the, uh--

1020
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,844
I go to that place
where there's the fucking monitor up.

1021
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,222
Sure enough, there's a picture
of me and the guy,

1022
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,058
upside down, in the loop-the-loop...

1023
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,686
staring so deep into each other's eyes.

1024
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,063
It was fucking bananas.

1025
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,316
I was like, "Okay, he felt it.
