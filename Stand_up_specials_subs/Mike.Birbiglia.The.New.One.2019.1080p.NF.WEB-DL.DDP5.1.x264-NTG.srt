00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,539
Thanks.

10
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,583
Thank you!

11
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,882
Thank you so much. I'm gonna put this on.

12
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,217
You gu... you guys
can turn off your things.

13
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,054
And, uh... and we can start this up.

14
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,890
Thanks for, uh... thanks for...
thanks for making it here,

15
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,308
to this big, beautiful theater.

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,769
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna tell you a story tonight.

17
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:02,645
But first,

18
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,564
I want to tell you

19
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:06,149
about my couch.

20
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,985
I love my couch.

21
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,654
It's first thing
I ever dropped money on in my life.

22
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,283
In your twenties,
you just sort of get a couch...

23
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,037
on the street.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,789
Like, it's garbage.

25
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,043
And then, you bring it home
to your six roommates.

26
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,671
And they're like, "Nice!"

27
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,051
And then, you reach an age...
For me, I was... I was 25.

28
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:37,138
I was living in Astoria, Queens,
and I was just like, "I'm a goddamn man.

29
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,433
I'm gonna buy a goddamn couch."

30
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,812
And I went to a department store
and I was like, "Wait.

31
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,355
How much is it?

32
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,400
A thousand dollars?

33
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,903
Is there gonna be a sale?

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,240
This is the sale?

35
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,536
Do you think you might go out of business
at some point?

36
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,581
You <i>are </i>going out of business?"

37
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:10,088
I thought about this a lot.
I think the reason a couch is so expensive

38
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,092
is that it's a deceptively sophisticated
piece of technology.

39
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,051
It's a...

40
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,594
It's a bed...

41
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,722
that hugs you.

42
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,436
Right? It's like,
"Do you want to watch TV?

43
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,649
Do you want to eat pizza?

44
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,987
You sure do like eating!

45
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,199
But I like that about you."

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,368
And beds are comfy.

47
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,620
But they know it.

48
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,628
They're like,
"I'd like to be called a 'king.'

49
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,133
I'm gonna need a box spring."

50
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,052
I'm like, "For what?"
They're like, "I don't touch the floor."

51
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,558
"Get your hands off that tag.

52
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,606
I'd like this room named after me."

53
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,322
Couches are humble.
They're like, "This is about you."

54
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,200
"Do you want to take a nap? Be my guest.

55
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,826
Do you want to have sex with my arm?"

56
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,911
I'll think about it.

57
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,750
I feel terrible. How...

58
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,794
I'm gonna pause for a moment...

59
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,839
and point out that you seem younger

60
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,134
than some of the other audience members.

61
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,677
Is this your mom?

62
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,595
Yes.

63
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,932
-How...

64
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,352
I know sometimes it's a rude question.
How old are you?

65
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,812
-Eleven.
-Eleven!

66
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,154
Before we proceed...

67
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,699
I want you to know

68
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,994
that I am not doing anything wrong.

69
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,374
You... you just have bad parents.

70
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,835
- I, uh... No.

71
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,879
They're wonderful parents,

72
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,715
but there may be some things
they need to explain later.

73
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,551
Or in seven years.

74
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,095
<i>-</i>Um...
<i>-</i>

75
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,056
But I'm thrilled you're here. I, uh...

76
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,530
My wife and I got married
almost exactly ten years ago,

77
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,489
here in New York City.

78
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:45,743
Actually, at City Hall,
which is about 56 blocks that way.

79
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,870
And, uh, it's a great place
to get married.

80
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,915
If you have a chance,
very convenient, lots of subway lines.

81
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,917
We took the subway home.

82
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,169
We took selfies on the subway.

83
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,587
We ate pizza and hamburgers

84
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,132
at this place in our neighborhood
at the time, called Big Nicks,

85
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,466
and then we took a nap...

86
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,218
on our couch.

87
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,556
We've spent thousands of hours together...

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,308
on this couch.

89
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,476
We've watched classic films on the couch.

90
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,146
We've eaten 20 birthday cakes
on the couch.

91
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,732
We've laughed hysterically on the couch.

92
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,608
We've cried in each other's arms

93
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,112
when we realized we were gonna
have to put our cat, Ivan, to sleep

94
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,322
on the couch.

95
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,408
It's soft, yet firm. Filthy, yet spotless.

96
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:29,162
Colorful, yet no one can agree
on what color it is.

97
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:31,789
I think it's green.

98
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,207
My wife thinks it's gray.

99
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,584
I looked it up...

100
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:35,960
Chocolate.

101
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,131
Which isn't a color...

102
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,135
But it's fitting,
'cause there's chocolate in it.

103
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,390
I love being home on my couch,
but I travel for my job.

104
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,311
I do this in, sometimes,
a hundred cities in a year,

105
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,396
which is more cities

106
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:56,939
than there are.

107
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,155
Some of them are just an Applebee's
with a dream.

108
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,865
-And...

109
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,704
And I-I love the shows,
but the travel can be rigorous.

110
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,332
Often, when I return home,
I'm entirely empty.

111
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,086
Just bones, and garbage, and Diet Coke,

112
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,712
all strung together

113
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:24,592
by those plastic ringlets
that bind sodas and strangle ducks,

114
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,220
and I collapse on the couch,

115
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,679
and I say to my wife,

116
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,182
I say, "Clo..." Her name's Jen.

117
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,601
"Clo...

118
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:37,355
leave me by the side of the road.

119
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,191
But she doesn't.

120
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,068
She revives me.

121
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,903
Jen has a soft, sweet voice.

122
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,072
It has a thread count of 600.

123
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,867
It always seems
like she's telling you a secret,

124
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,411
like, "I'm gonna make tea."

125
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
I'm like, "I won't tell anyone."

126
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,667
So, we'll lie on the couch,

127
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,294
and she'll order me
a chicken kabob platter

128
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,546
and scratch my back,

129
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,673
and we'll snuggle with our cat Mazzy

130
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,384
and watch a documentary about murder.

131
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,556
And that's what love is.

132
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,059
And it all takes place...

133
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,103
on the couch.

134
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,731
In October of 2012,
I'm doing a show in Boston,

135
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,233
and I'm staying with my brother Joe.

136
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,485
My brother Joe used to be so cool.

137
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,197
-And then he had two kids.

138
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,407
And now he's a loser.

139
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,617
-No, he's not a loser.

140
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,162
I will say, like, it's just less fun
to visit his house.

141
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,456
Like, I'm trudging through living room

142
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,791
and there's crap all over the floor.

143
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,335
I'm trying to eat breakfast
at the kitchen table

144
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:46,257
and I realize there's one of those sticky
yogurt pouch containers underneath me,

145
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,637
and the table's filled with wet Cheerios,
and sippy cups, and Aquaphor.

146
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,140
And Joe's trying to show me
this video of his son,

147
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,393
but his son is sitting right there,
and I'm like,

148
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,645
"I got Henry live!

149
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,898
-I don't need Henry on tape."

150
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,484
And the video itself... underwhelming.

151
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,902
-You know, like...

152
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,238
"This is a 12-minute video
of Henry picking apples."

153
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,824
-I'm like, "Nobody wants to see that."

154
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,161
There's so much great content out there.
I mean, I...

155
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,041
I was on YouTube, I saw a 90-second video

156
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,627
of a cat giving another cat a massage.

157
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,005
Don't waste my time...

158
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,591
...with Henry picking apples.

159
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,134
And as I'm watching this,

160
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:34,138
actual Henry starts
whacking me in the eye

161
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,349
with this foam bat,

162
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,519
and I'm like, "What game is this?"
And my...

163
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,354
My brother does nothing.

164
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,524
He's like a world wrestling referee,
like, "I don't know.

165
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,984
He's not supposed to do that."

166
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,446
I don't know what to do.

167
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,657
I hide in the bathroom
and I'm trying to pee,

168
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,702
but they have the child-proof circle
inside the circle, inside the circle,

169
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,372
like a carnival peeing game

170
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,250
that I'm losing badly.

171
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,545
And then Henry pushes in the door.

172
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,089
Now I'm peeing into the wall...

173
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,008
which has pee on it already.

174
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:11,926
And then...

175
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,594
I lock the door.

176
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,556
I'm standing in Joe's bathroom
for 15 minutes,

177
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,558
doing no activity

178
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,935
other than avoiding his family.

179
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,687
And I pull out my phone.

180
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,064
I'm looking up things
going on in town that night.

181
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,818
I walk out, I go, "Joe, we should see
this band at the Paradise."

182
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,112
He says, "I can't go to a concert, Mike!

183
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,239
I have kids!"

184
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,032
I said, "Sorry."

185
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,370
And he says, "Don't apologize.
It's the most joy I've ever experienced."

186
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,417
Congratulations on your ambiguous tone.
And so...

187
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,004
So we don't go out.

188
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,673
We stay home
and watch these <i>Baby Einstein</i> videos,

189
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,427
which have yielded no geniuses
to my knowledge. There was...

190
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,598
There's nothing about
the theory of relativity in the one I saw.

191
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,559
It was a pig playing a xylophone,

192
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,521
and then a dog barks,
and a lady's voice goes, "Pillow!"

193
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,440
-And then...

194
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:11,152
my nephew spits yogurt on his shirt,

195
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,654
and my brother's like, "He's a genius."

196
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,616
And I'm like, "I'm not seeing it, but..."

197
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,329
I fall asleep around 7:30 p.m.,

198
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,122
because being around children

199
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,416
makes me want to be unconscious
at all times.

200
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,626
-And then...

201
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,794
I'm wide awake around 4:15 a.m.

202
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,548
with this fierce cold from sleeping
in this Petri-dish house, and this...

203
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,217
ringing foam-bat headache,

204
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,387
and I hobble onto a 6:30 a.m. flight,

205
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,973
and, sure enough,
there's a baby across the aisle,

206
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,351
screaming at the top of his lungs.

207
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,393
And in that moment...

208
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,063
I can't defend this, but in that moment,
I remember thinking,

209
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,358
"That baby doesn't need to be anywhere!"

210
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,568
-You know what I mean by that?

211
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,364
I can't even begin to defend it.
It's just how I felt.

212
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,492
I was like, "It doesn't know
it lives in Boston!

213
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,079
It doesn't know what New York City is!

214
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,915
I'm wearing noise-canceling headphones,

215
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,584
-which apparently are not enough.
<i>-</i>

216
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:13,381
You need baby-canceling headphones,

217
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,175
which are condoms, I guess. But I...

218
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,846
Look, I think we've got to get babies
off planes.

219
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,057
I feel like we got rid of smoking
in the '80s,

220
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,975
we can get rid of babies now,

221
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,144
or bring back smoking,

222
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,814
get these babies some cigarettes,<i></i>
'cause they're...

223
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,525
They're so stressed out.

224
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,276
And so, I land...

225
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,780
I land at JFK,
I take a cab to our apartment,

226
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,574
I collapse on our beloved couch,

227
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,118
and it hugs me.

228
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,414
Jen gets me some mint tea
and some hot-and-sour soup,

229
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,207
and I say, "Clo...

230
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,671
people with kids...

231
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,881
are miserable."

232
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,262
And look, maybe I have
a low tolerance for children, 'cause...

233
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,223
I've lost a lot of great friends to kids.

234
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,397
Because it really is
like a disease in some ways,

235
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,526
but it's worse than a disease,
'cause they want you to have it, too.

236
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,744
They're like, "You should have kids, too."

237
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,579
"I'm watching you do it

238
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,582
and I'm thinking I'm gonna not do it."

239
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,295
They're like zombies.
Like, "You should eat brains."

240
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,674
"I'm watching you eat brains
and it seems like it ruined your life."

241
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,968
And the way you kill zombies--

242
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:44,305
You probably know this from the movies,
right? Is you shoot 'em...

243
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,265
-in the head...

244
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,767
with a shotgun.

245
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,101
Or...

246
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,771
you chop off their heads with a machete

247
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,814
or a samurai sword,

248
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,941
which is also

249
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,777
the way you kill anyone.

250
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,454
So I'm talking about this with Jen,
and she laughs,

251
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,581
and I laugh, and we laugh...

252
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:12,166
as one.

253
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,503
And then she says,

254
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,214
"But if we had a baby,

255
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,758
I think it would be different."

256
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:24,929
And I was like...

257
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,730
You got bit!

258
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,449
I tried to remain calm.
I said, "Clo, I was very clear...

259
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,869
when we got married
that I never wanted to have a kid,"

260
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,830
which, by the way, gets you nothing.

261
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,082
Being very clear...

262
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,043
is apparently useless,

263
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,336
because she said I was clear.

264
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,422
I didn't want to have a baby at the time,
but that I might change.

265
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,841
And I said, "I was clear...

266
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,218
I would never change."

267
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,887
She said,
"If you don't want to have a baby,

268
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,557
maybe I'll have one on my own,
and we can stay married."

269
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,392
And I said, "Oh, that'll be a good look."

270
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,603
Just you, and me, and this kid

271
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,981
that's a cross between you
and some grad student

272
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,150
jacking his way through SUNY Purchase.
I mean, you can't...

273
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,656
You can't have a kid on the side, like...

274
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,325
-"We keep him in the shed!"

275
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,620
I mean, people do it.
I've seen the documentaries.

276
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,039
It's just... those aren't my role models.

277
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,458
And then people will be like,
"You guys have kids?"

278
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,294
I gotta be like, "She does."

279
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:48,220
She says a baby wouldn't have
to change the way we live our lives.

280
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,805
I said, "Did you get...

281
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,265
less smart?

282
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,476
Because you used to be so smart,

283
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,896
and what you're saying currently, it...

284
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,857
-is factually incorrect."

285
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,694
By the way, I've never wanted to have
a kid for seven specific reasons.

286
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,532
Number one, I've never felt like
there should be more of me in the world.

287
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,576
Don't get me wrong. I think one is funny.

288
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,535
You know? One...

289
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,245
Ha-ha! Good one!

290
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,788
You know what I mean? Like...

291
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,916
"Let's get tickets." But...

292
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,338
But I believe in survival of the fittest,

293
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,048
and this is not the fittest.

294
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,382
-Like I...

295
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,719
I have the body of someone
who's just about to start P90X.

296
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,306
And then, doesn't. And...

297
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,184
And I have a long medical history.

298
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,728
I had a malignant tumor in my bladder
when I was 19.

299
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,771
I was very lucky.

300
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:39,980
Uh, they took it out.

301
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,359
Uh, it hasn't come back, but every year
I go for what's called a cystoscopy,

302
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,694
where they take a rod about this long,

303
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,238
with the width of a Twizzler
and a camera on the end,

304
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,323
and they stick it

305
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,743
through your urethra to look at--

306
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,953
I know!

307
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,831
While you're awake.

308
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,001
I should say
while other people are awake.

309
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,170
I get knocked out for it. But I didn't...

310
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,216
I didn't the first time. When I was 20...

311
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,134
my urologist, Dr. Kaplan,

312
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,971
stuck me in the chair
with the leg stirrups,

313
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,473
and he put on
a local anesthetic and some jelly,

314
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,517
which was quite cold. And the moment...

315
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,687
The moment he made contact,

316
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:20,938
I go...

317
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,776
And he said, "Relax your butt."

318
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,571
And I said, "You relax <i>your </i>butt!"
Which...

319
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,076
By the way, if you ever find yourself
in a situation

320
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,371
where you need to convince someone
to relax their butt...

321
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,376
one thing I would suggest not saying...

322
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,217
is, "Relax your butt."

323
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,887
I feel like it has
almost a reversing quality. I...

324
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,223
Look, if that's your end game,

325
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,310
maybe throw a curveball like,
"Relax your ears!"

326
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:04,606
You'd be like, "Oh, my butt feels
pretty loose!" And then, it just...

327
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,776
Then it just slides right in there,
which is all to say...

328
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,820
I get knocked out for this every year.

329
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,741
Last year was particularly eventful,
'cause I went for my physical,

330
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,243
and I was nearing 40,
so they asked to do the prostate exam,

331
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,079
which you probably know,
is a finger in the butt

332
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,666
and one in your mouth
if you're close to the physician. And I...

333
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,713
I think that's what it is. I couldn't...

334
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,299
I couldn't handle it. Like...

335
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,177
He went for it, and I was like...

336
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,888
"Oh! No, thank you!" And so...

337
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,684
So, when I went for my cystoscopy,
I said to Dr. Kaplan, I go, "Hey...

338
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,770
while I'm under...

339
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,439
um, do you mind...

340
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,649
also...

341
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,902
sticking your finger...

342
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,738
in my butt?"

343
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,366
Dr. Kaplan goes, "Yeah, I can do that."

344
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,165
And I thought, like,
I might be a medical genius.

345
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,542
Like, I never...
I never went to school for this,

346
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,544
I barely finished <i>Our Bodies, Ourselves,</i>

347
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,588
-and I just...

348
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:13,258
invented the Urology two-for,
which if it catches on,

349
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,386
should be renamed the "Birbiglia Bonus."
And so...

350
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,057
So, I had bladder cancer.

351
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,727
I have a life-threatening sleepwalking
disorder, which is very extreme.

352
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:28,148
I mean, 13 years ago, I jumped in my sleep

353
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:32,694
through a second-story window
of a La Quinta Inn.

354
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:38,367
Yeah. When I say "through,"
I mean "through the glass."

355
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,660
The glass was double-paned.

356
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,954
I ended up with 33 stitches in my legs.

357
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,581
The glass was a centimeter
from my femoral artery.

358
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:48,502
Had it struck there, I could have just
bled out on the front lawn and died.

359
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,922
I was diagnosed with a very rare thing.
It's called REM Behavior Disorder.

360
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,341
So when I go to bed at night,
I take medication

361
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,927
and I sleep in a sleeping bag...

362
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,929
up to my neck.

363
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,223
And I wear mittens...

364
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,061
so I can't open the sleeping bag.

365
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,820
And that's my life!

366
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,155
-So...

367
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:19,950
Yeah, there are details in my life

368
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,078
that are both setups
and punchlines. And...

369
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,623
I make a lot of jokes about it,
but it's a very serious thing.

370
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,043
There are people who have what I have,
who, in rare instances, have been known,

371
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,045
to physically harm the person
they're in bed with

372
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,672
while remaining asleep.

373
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,300
Uh, there was a news story
a few months ago,

374
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,636
which people were tweeting at me,
which, by the way...

375
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,765
-Don't do that. Where...

376
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,268
A guy goes camping with his wife.

377
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,521
He has a dream
there's a wild animal in the tent,

378
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,607
and he's punching and kicking,
and he wakes up.

379
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,400
It's not an animal, it's his wife.

380
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,485
And she's dead.

381
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,154
-I know.

382
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,703
So I don't think
that's a great quality in a dad. So...

383
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,832
So I had bladder cancer,

384
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,751
I have a life-threatening
sleepwalking disorder.

385
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,502
My health is not trending upward.

386
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,089
Last year, I went for my physical.
My doctor took blood and he called me.

387
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,175
He said, "You have Lyme disease...

388
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,801
and..."

389
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,346
"And?"

390
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:24,514
"...diabetes."

391
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:28,185
I was like, "One at the time.
Everybody's gonna get a chance."

392
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,603
-It was like...

393
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,356
It was like going
to a parent-teacher conference,

394
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,816
and they're like, "Your son's getting D's,

395
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,028
and he's been molested by the gym teacher.

396
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,032
We're gonna need separate meetings.

397
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,414
I couldn't believe it.

398
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,042
Thirty-nine years old,
diagnosed with type-2 diabetes.

399
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,171
He said, "Is there anything in your diet
that might be spiking your blood sugar?"

400
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,676
I said, "Sometimes, I eat pizza
until I'm unconscious."

401
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,762
He said, "I think that might be it."

402
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,684
So I had Lyme disease, diabetes,

403
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,144
I'm generally devoid of joy.

404
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,398
I really am. I try.

405
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:18,151
Like, I was listening to this TED Talk
about how to find joy in your life.

406
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,695
And the host said,

407
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,406
"One thing everyone enjoys...

408
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,533
is confetti."

409
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,666
And I thought, "Oh, no!

410
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,918
I hate confetti."

411
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:39,840
To me, confetti is just garbage
that we throw into the air.

412
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,803
So I had cancer,
life-threatening sleeping disorder,

413
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,888
Lyme disease, diabetes,

414
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,932
I dislike joy.

415
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,146
I'm not exactly handing off
A-plus genes here.

416
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,357
Number two...

417
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,866
I love my marriage, and I feel...

418
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,952
I really do, I feel so lucky
to have found my wife.

419
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,455
And I don't fall for these clichés
at weddings,

420
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,334
where they'll say, like,
"Two becomes one."

421
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,669
But I do feel, if you're lucky,

422
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,089
in a relationship, there are moments...

423
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,550
And I mean...

424
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,719
moments.

425
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,847
Like, this is a moment.

426
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,558
That was a moment.

427
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,481
There are moments...

428
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,900
where you feel like your souls
are colliding

429
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,903
in a way that two souls have never
collided in the history of humankind.

430
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:45,781
And you think, "How did I get this lucky?"

431
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,496
My wife and I hate going to parties,
but we love driving away from parties.

432
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,420
A few years ago, we went
to our friend Katie's birthday,

433
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:03,465
and this lady got up and gave a speech,
which isn't a thing.

434
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,050
-And...

435
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,594
that's why I remember it so well.

436
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,598
She said, "Last year,
Katie and I went scuba diving,

437
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,352
and her oxygen tank
got stuck on the rocks,

438
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,521
and I wriggled it free,

439
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,065
and I may have saved her life.

440
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,985
I saved your best friend's life."

441
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,989
Jen and I lock eyes from across the room,

442
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,534
and we project the sentence,

443
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,245
"We're gonna talk about this for years."

444
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,627
And we have. So, here's...

445
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,546
Okay, here's how it comes up.

446
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,298
Whenever Jen and I do
something sweet for one another,

447
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,302
like if she zips me up
in my sleeping bag before bed,

448
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:54,099
what she will do, and she'll say,
"It's time to put you in your pod!"

449
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,810
And I'll say, "Thanks."

450
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,147
And she'll say,
"I saved your best friend's life."

451
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,152
It's never not funny.

452
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:09,072
It literally has never not been funny.

453
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,075
And I don't want to give that up.
I don't want that to change.

454
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,120
I don't want a third person showing up
like, "What about me?"

455
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,706
I'm like, "We don't even know you!"

456
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,209
Number three.

457
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:25,046
I don't know anything and I'm not ready
to teach the children.

458
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,132
I mean, I've read hundreds of books.

459
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,092
I've retained very little.

460
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,472
In third grade,
they taught us photosynthesis,

461
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,808
and I thought, "This is not gonna stick."

462
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,062
And it hasn't.

463
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,232
I'm not 100% sure why it rains.

464
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,406
I'm not sure you are either.

465
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,326
I don't know anything for certain.

466
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,746
I think it's entirely possible
consciousness is a hallucination.

467
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,331
How do I explain that to a kid?

468
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,707
"See that juice box?

469
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,375
Don't be so sure."

470
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,838
I can't explain existence.

471
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,466
I was raised Catholic,
but I didn't really believe in God.

472
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,593
I just believed in my mom.

473
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,429
And my mom believed in God.

474
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,015
It was like I was in this weird
three-way with God,

475
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:21,186
where I'm like, "It's okay if He's here
while you're here,

476
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,314
but and I'm not gonna do anything
with just me and Him."

477
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,572
To be clear,
I've never had sex with my mom.

478
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,825
Or God, or had a three-way.

479
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,202
So it's a true metaphor.

480
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,830
Number four, I have a cat.

481
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,543
-Number five, I...

482
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:45,460
I have a job.

483
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,795
That's what we're doing here.

484
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,172
It took me a long time
to figure out anything I was good at.

485
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,175
I wasn't good at video games, or archery,
or whatever the hell kids do.

486
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,719
And then, I figured this out.
I don't want to give that up.

487
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:58,598
My brother's like,
"Mike, you can have a kid and a career."

488
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,017
And I said,
"Yeah, Joe, but it'll be worse."

489
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,021
If we're being honest with ourselves...

490
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,775
kids hold us back.

491
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,324
My best example of this
is the history of women.

492
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,701
Stay with me.

493
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:18,952
-Uh...

494
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,624
I feel like women are smarter than men,
their brains are more sophisticated,

495
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,334
and they make 21 cents less on a dollar.

496
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,130
I think women are smarter from birth.
You ever talk to a two-year-old girl?

497
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,509
Two-year-old girls are like,
"Would you like to have a tea party?

498
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,971
A two-year old boy is like, "No!"

499
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,270
And it doesn't get better. I mean...

500
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,024
Marginally better. If I were a woman,
I'd be furious at all times.

501
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,694
I'd be like, "These morons are in charge
of anything?

502
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,821
How did this happen?"

503
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,240
The answer is "children."

504
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,620
Which brings me to number six: I don't
think there should be children anymore.

505
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,334
Nothing drastic. I think the current
children can see through their term.

506
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,177
I just think maybe we cut it off there,
because...

507
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,930
Look, we were given the Earth
and we failed.

508
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,434
At a certain point we got to call it,
right? I mean, I...

509
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,562
And I live here with you guys
in this supposedly liberal city.

510
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,356
If we're honest, we barely recycle.

511
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,274
-I mean, come on.

512
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,569
It's like there's the garbage,
and then the blue bin,

513
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,114
which is basically like,
"Is this anything? Like...

514
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,328
Here are some batteries
stuffed in an ink cartridge,

515
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,372
could you turn that into something else?"

516
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,831
-And then...

517
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:53,922
And then we just throw it on trucks
and ship it to Pennsylvania,

518
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,384
which is fine,
till New York sinks into the ocean,

519
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,178
and we all have to move
to Pennsylvania, like...

520
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,473
"I'll sleep in the almond milk jug,

521
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:06,142
and you can sleep in the packing peanuts.

522
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:10,814
Someday we'll move to Blu-ray Mountain."
I mean...

523
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,317
In Germany...

524
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,154
In Germany, they recycle 45 percent
of their garbage.

525
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,282
Thirty-eight percent of their garbage,
they incinerate.

526
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,202
Granted, their history of incineration,
not great, and...

527
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,330
Obviously sensitive, I get it.

528
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,542
Germans are always like,
"We're not Nazis."

529
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,336
I'm like, "Yeah, but you know some."
I mean, I don't...

530
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,171
I don't know any.
How many do you know?

531
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,174
Some? I think that's enough
to exaggerate for humor.

532
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,596
Which brings me to number seven.

533
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,891
People aren't great.

534
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,439
Not just Nazis. I mean,
people in general are not great. And...

535
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,607
And look, you guys seem fine.

536
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,819
And the conventional wisdom
is that people are generally good.

537
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,987
But are they?

538
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,324
I'm not sure.
Like, I think women are okay.

539
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,537
I think men are on thin ice.

540
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,208
I mean, historically, right,
if you zoom out a little.

541
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,252
Currently,

542
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,881
if you zoom back in, and then...

543
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,592
And then, personally,
think about the men you know,

544
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,428
think about the men you've met
in your life.

545
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:27,056
When I do that, I think, like,
two or three are horrible.

546
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,642
Really, unspeakable.

547
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,772
Just a few, two or three. Most are decent.

548
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,983
I think that's sort of the ceiling
for men. I think...

549
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,526
I think "good" is aspirational.

550
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,821
I think "great" is a fantasy.

551
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,074
If you're with someone who's great,

552
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,036
get out of there.

553
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,582
The men we used to think were great

554
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:56,503
were priests, politicians,
and gymnastics doctors. It hasn't...

555
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:02,425
It hasn't ended well for "great."
And look...

556
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,886
I think sometimes it's hard to tell.

557
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:08,264
When I was 23, I was in Amsterdam
with a friend of a friend,

558
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,266
which is a cautionary type of person.

559
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,312
A friend of a friend is someone
you murder people with, or...

560
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,731
buy steak knives from.

561
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,899
And we're walking...

562
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:22,779
through the Red Light District.
This is how naive I was at 23.

563
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,614
I didn't know what that meant.

564
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,199
If you don't know,

565
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,410
it's a neighborhood in Amsterdam
that has literally

566
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:34,207
hundreds of prostitutes in windows,

567
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,834
illuminated by these red lights.

568
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,211
And I'm walking
with my friend of a friend,

569
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,256
I'm thinking these are bars
or strip clubs,

570
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,717
and I say to my friend of a friend, like,
"Should... should we go in one?"

571
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,973
He says, "Yeah,
but we gotta choose carefully."

572
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,809
I said, "How come?"

573
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,187
He said, "It's expensive."
I said, "How expensive?"

574
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,565
He said, "It's about $200."

575
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,984
I said, "$200...

576
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,279
to go into a strip club?

577
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,699
He says, "No...

578
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,996
They're prostitutes."

579
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:14,998
I said...

580
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,009
"We gotta choose carefully."

581
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,811
I wanna be very clear.

582
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,232
I don't want to tell you...

583
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,568
this story.

584
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,367
It's the only story I'll tell you tonight
I genuinely do not want to tell you,

585
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,954
but I feel like it's essential
to the larger story I'm telling.

586
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,794
I chose someone
who didn't have a long line.

587
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,386
There was something about the line
that made it too real.

588
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,722
Like, if I were waiting in line,
I could imagine thinking,

589
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:16,142
"The line for this prostitute
is outrageous!" And I...

590
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,978
I chose someone
who sort of looked like me.

591
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,398
She was a cross between Matt Damon
and Bill O'Reilly. And...

592
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,196
She walks me up these rickety steps

593
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,741
into this room
that's brightly lit and spare.

594
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,118
There's only a bed
in the shape of a gurney.

595
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,915
She says, "Take off all your clothes
and sit on the bed," and I did that.

596
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,459
And my body...

597
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,003
was not excited.

598
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,465
Which is, of course, a euphemism...

599
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,553
for my penis.

600
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,806
And I... I thought that would be it.

601
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:58,309
Like, she called it, like an umpire.
Like, "Rain delay."

602
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,686
But-but that's not...

603
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,272
That's not what happened.

604
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,609
What happened was that she took
a condom and she put it on the thing.

605
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,736
Which I didn't know
was physically possible.

606
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,447
I grew up in Massachusetts,
and we had health class in seventh grade,

607
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,366
and we put a condom on a banana,

608
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,952
but never on a water balloon.

609
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,578
-And...

610
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:21,958
So...

611
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:27,255
So she puts the thing on the thing,
 and then...

612
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,549
starts fellating the thing.

613
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:33,261
And then, if I were to guess,
I'd say about 40 seconds later, I just...

614
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,263
And then, she said, "I guess you're done."

615
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,306
And I said to her...
and I'll never forget this.

616
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,058
I said, "Can't we just hang out?"

617
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,735
I'm telling you this long,
embarrassing story to make the point...

618
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,156
that I consider myself...

619
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,199
decent.

620
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,624
So I explain all this to my wife.

621
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,048
Because it's part of my larger point.
I said, "Clo...

622
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:15,303
Why would you want to bring a child
into this world with me?

623
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,430
I'm a walking pre-existing condition,

624
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,849
the Earth is sinking into the ocean,

625
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,851
we're about to be living
in the movie <i>Waterworld,</i>

626
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,020
which did terribly at the box office.

627
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,066
People are horrible, and I'm not great."

628
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,612
She gets real quiet.
My wife is a poet, like an actual poet.

629
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,197
So, she'll say one line,

630
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,908
and then there's a lot of space.

631
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,287
She says, "I know all of that.

632
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,916
And I think you'd be a good dad."

633
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,378
So that night,
we have sex without a condom,

634
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,130
which, if you haven't tried it...

635
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,843
by all means, give it a chance.

636
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,141
Not with my wife, but with your partner.
It's a...

637
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:07,814
It's a phenomenal activity.
There are videos of it online. And...

638
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,483
But I was anxious.

639
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,194
When we were doing it,
I was like, "I'm not sure!"

640
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,737
Which is not sexy language.

641
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,366
That's right up there with
"Is the oven on?" And...

642
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,828
"I'm gonna wear my shirt." And...

643
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,706
I was anxious, 'cause I'd never had sex
without a condom,

644
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,750
which is a shocking thing to do
for the first time.

645
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,253
It's like going on a road trip,
and halfway through the trip,

646
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,547
the car just flies, and you're like...

647
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:34,632
"This is better!

648
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,553
There's no traffic!

649
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,515
And we can go anywhere!"

650
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,432
And so...

651
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,187
So it's exhilarating,
but also nerve-racking.

652
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,982
The next day, I call Joe.
I'm like, "I am freaking out,

653
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:52,817
'cause I'm flying the car."

654
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,571
And he says, "What's the worst thing
that could happen?"

655
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,490
I said, "I don't think
you're following the analogy. I...

656
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,576
I'd have a kid.

657
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,870
Is there anything I should know?"

658
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,748
He says, "You can't know what it's like
to have a kid...

659
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,126
until you have a kid."

660
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,629
And I say, "Can you be more specific?"

661
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,842
And he takes a long, deep breath...

662
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,429
and he says, "It's relentless."

663
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,978
I say... I say,"What do you mean
by 'relentless'?"

664
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,605
He says, "You know how you go to the gym

665
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,440
and you push, and you sweat,
and it sucks?"

666
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,775
I said, "Yeah."
He says, "When you have a kid,

667
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,611
you can't even go to the gym."

668
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,328
And then he says,
"But I'm not worried about you, Mike,

669
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,496
'cause whatever happens,
whether you have a kid or not,

670
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,208
it's not gonna be better or worse.

671
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,753
It's just gonna be new."

672
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:58,883
So, Jen and I attempt to conceive
for eight months, and it does not work,

673
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,052
'cause like I said, my body is a lemon...

674
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:06,432
and my boys don't swim, which killed me,
'cause if I'd known that in my twenties,

675
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,975
I would have had a much better time.

676
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,560
-In my twenties...

677
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:12,563
I treated my sperm
like it was plutonium. Like...

678
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,650
"Don't let that sperm
anywhere near those eggs!"

679
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,069
Like, there'd be this infestation

680
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,863
of tiny neurotic Mike Birbiglia toddlers,

681
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:25,409
like, "Why would I slide down the slide
when I can walk down the steps?"

682
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,501
It turns out I do not have plutonium,
I have flat soda.

683
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,044
-And, uh...

684
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,548
And my boys don't swim,
which isn't surprising.

685
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,967
I mean, I don't swim.

686
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,635
-Uh, I...

687
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,804
I swim, but in circles.

688
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:47,765
I'm always ordering hot dogs
at the side of the pool.

689
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,476
Which is not a quality you want
in your sperm,

690
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,186
that hungry, lethargic quality.

691
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,105
You want your sperm to be like,

692
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,982
"I swim from sea to sea!"

693
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:59,735
Like the Ryan Lochte of sperm
without all the fake robbery.

694
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,987
But I found out...

695
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,448
'Cause I...
I went to Dr. Kaplan,

696
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,616
and he asked me

697
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,411
to masturbate into a cup.

698
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,788
I said, "That's rude."

699
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,126
And he said,
"No, it's a medical procedure...

700
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,878
called 'masturbating into a cup.'"

701
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,549
I said, "If it's for science,
sure, I get that."

702
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,970
Two things about masturbating
into a cup at the doctor's...

703
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,596
I will limit it to two.

704
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,685
I could talk about this for six hours.

705
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,941
One...

706
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,280
everybody knows what's happening.

707
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,202
Everybody!

708
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:54,165
Doctors, nurses,
people in the waiting room,

709
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,751
the UPS guy down the hall.

710
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,879
And you're trying to play cool.
You're like, "Oh, yeah,Brexit."

711
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,881
-You know what I mean? Just like...

712
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,966
"Sea levels rising rapidly."

713
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,136
Everyone's like, "You're about
to ejaculate in Tupperware."

714
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,888
-And...

715
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:09,805
Two.

716
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,642
They give you porn,

717
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,104
and it's the most extreme porn
I had ever seen.

718
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,314
-I was...

719
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,734
I was like, "Easy, medical porn."

720
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,069
Like, here I was...

721
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,321
all these years,

722
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:28,908
thinking I'm taking in the USDA
recommended levels of porn,

723
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,034
and they're like...

724
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,038
"You're gonna need a lot more than that.

725
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:36,207
You're gonna need to take a multi."

726
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,291
And so...

727
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,837
So I go in and I do the thing.

728
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:44,340
Dr. Kaplan calls me a few days later
with the results.

729
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,009
He says, "Mike, you're gonna have
to come back in...

730
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,137
-and masturbate into a cup."

731
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,349
Again? And now I'm like, "Is this a joke?"
I mean...

732
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,560
Really, 'cause I'm in the jokes business,

733
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,229
-and actually...

734
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,106
that would be a pretty good joke,

735
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,190
-where...

736
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,276
you convince a stranger to masturbate...

737
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,405
into a cup,

738
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,740
and then you're like, "He did it!"

739
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,245
They're like, "He did?"
"Yeah, now what do we do?"

740
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,955
"Ask him to do it again."

741
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,040
"Ask him to do it again?
Why would he do it again?"

742
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,043
"I don't know. I don't know
why he did it in the first place.

743
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,795
This whole thing is a sham!"

744
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,883
A cup, by the way, being the least
conveniently shaped receptacle.

745
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:30,428
One could masturbate into a cup,

746
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,139
assumes a level
of composure and accuracy...

747
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,185
that is so rare in this activity.

748
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,105
A cup assumes
the precision of an archer, like...

749
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,446
When, in fact, you're like,
"It's everywhere!

750
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,159
Put some in the cup.

751
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,621
Get me some gloves!"

752
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,459
And now everybody knows. And so...

753
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:07,548
So I go in and I do it again.
This time, I waive off the medical porn.

754
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,092
I say, "I'm gonna use memory porn,
'cause I'm a...

755
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,511
I'm a Christian." And, uh...

756
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,516
Dr. Kaplan calls me at the office
a few days later with the results.

757
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,559
He says, "Mike...

758
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,644
If you want to get your wife pregnant,

759
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,272
you're gonna have to have
what's called a varicocele repair.

760
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,398
I'd never heard this term.

761
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,151
He said,
"We cut an incision in your abdomen,

762
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,987
we go into the vein adjoining a testicle,

763
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,406
we squeeze out the excess blood,

764
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:33,991
we patch you up,

765
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,744
and you can't walk for about a week."

766
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,920
I said, "I don't even want to have a kid."
Like, I...

767
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:51,217
I had to level with him because
it was escalating so rapidly, and...

768
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:55,846
I was like, "Dr. Kaplan,
I wasn't gonna tell you this,

769
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,556
but I don't even really want
to have a kid,

770
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,434
and now you're describing
a <i>Black Mirror </i>episode, and I don't...

771
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,729
I don't want to be in that one." And...

772
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,567
Dr. Kaplan says to me something

773
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,195
I never expected anybody
to say to me as an adult,

774
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,738
never mind a medical professional.

775
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,199
He says, "Mike,
here's what they don't tell you.

776
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,619
No men want to have kids."

777
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,914
And I go, "That's not true.

778
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:23,958
Tell me more."

779
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:29,255
He said, "Our wives want us to,
we all go along with it.

780
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,007
It's the best thing
that'll ever happen to you.

781
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,678
You'll call me and you'll thank me.

782
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,180
It is the most joy...

783
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,100
you will ever experience."

784
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,438
And I stumbled out of his office

785
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,107
in a daze.

786
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:51,235
I mean, I nearly wandered into traffic.

787
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,362
And then, I turned around...

788
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,031
and I walked back in,

789
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,993
and I make an appointment
for a varicocele repair.

790
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,496
And they ask you to sign
some pretty extreme forms.

791
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,207
Like, "We may accidentally
cut out your balls."

792
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:08,877
I'm like, "Do your best, Mike Birbiglia."

793
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,841
"We may replace your balls
with Chinese yin and yang balls."

794
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,260
<i>"Namaste,</i> Mike Birbiglia."

795
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:19,930
The night before the scheduled procedure,

796
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,809
I made the mistake of going
on a surgery message board. And...

797
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:25,728
Oh, I know!

798
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,313
-And...

799
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:32,610
Okay, a gentleman
who had had this exact procedure wrote,

800
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,653
in all caps...

801
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,698
which I found aggressive...

802
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,367
D--

803
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,078
"Do not have this surgery.

804
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,336
Your p--

805
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,339
Your penis will never work again."

806
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,342
Also all caps.

807
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,804
I call my doctor,

808
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,432
in the middle of the night,

809
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,810
and I say, "Hey, I was just
doing some research,

810
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,396
and I was talking to this one guy,

811
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,733
-and he was shouting about...

812
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,777
how his penis doesn't work.

813
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,278
Is that possible?"

814
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:20,366
He goes, "Mike, a lot of these people
are getting this stuff done by amateurs."

815
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,539
Which I pictured immediately, like,
"I like huntin',

816
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,291
I like fishin',

817
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,629
I do varicocele repair
down in the garage."

818
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:40,052
At this point, Jen didn't think
it was a good idea.

819
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,512
I didn't think it was a good idea.

820
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,390
I remember sitting up
in the middle of the night,

821
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,976
thinking, "My wife would be
a great mother,

822
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,021
and I don't want to get
in the way of that.

823
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,442
So, I'll let him tinker with my balls
for a few hours."

824
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,697
Well, tinker they did.

825
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:05,452
The next morning, after several hours,
I limped out of outpatient surgery.

826
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,580
For eight days,
I walked around New York City...

827
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,667
like a cowboy in the snow.

828
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,424
People were like, "What happened?"

829
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:21,051
I was like,
"Unnecessary ball surgery."

830
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,473
But it worked.
At that point, I'm shooting firebombs,

831
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,434
-slinging rockets...

832
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:31,520
in every direction, laser accuracy.

833
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:35,357
Everyone I'm even shaking hands with
is walking away pregnant.

834
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,109
-And...

835
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,446
One of those people...

836
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,239
was my wife.

837
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,657
Aww.

838
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,575
Thanks.

839
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,455
I'll tell you, I was more excited
than she was.

840
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,332
I came back from a trip
to Appleton, Wisconsin,

841
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,669
and she said, "I'm pregnant."
And I said, "Yes!"

842
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:58,922
'Cause I'd forgotten
I didn't want to have a kid.

843
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,550
I mean, that's...
that's how dumb my brain is.

844
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,802
Like, even though
I didn't want to have a kid,

845
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,389
when Jen said she was pregnant,
I was like, "We got a win!"

846
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,474
-Like...

847
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,642
"Now, what?"  And...

848
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,105
She was pregnant for about 75 months.

849
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,857
-And I'm not sure...

850
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,110
of the exact amount of time,
but it was a long duration,

851
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,112
and it was a brutal pregnancy.

852
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,614
It was hard for her, too.

853
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,157
Because...

854
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,369
There was...

855
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,705
No, there are just a lot...
there are a lot of extremes.

856
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,290
The first one I learned about

857
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,585
is in a woman's first trimester,
her hormones double...

858
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,467
every three days.

859
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,180
That's so much! And...

860
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:54,853
The first hint of this
is when we interviewed this OB-GYN,

861
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,730
and she seemed very sharp.

862
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,859
We walked out, and Jen said,
"She's a fucking monster!"

863
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,111
And I said, "I totally agree.

864
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,072
She's not good at being a doctor."

865
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,449
And that was not enough.

866
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,785
She said, "No, she's a fucking monster!"

867
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:13,580
And I was like, "Yeah!
She's a fucking monster!"

868
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,709
And now I'm screaming
at the top of my lungs,

869
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,461
in broad daylight,

870
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,798
on the corner of 29th and 1st,

871
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:26,343
about a doctor who I think is pretty good.

872
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:34,977
When we get home, Jen says,

873
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,813
"Will you go to the grocery store
and get me some pretzels?"

874
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,566
I said, "Yeah, I'll head over there
in a few minutes."

875
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,200
And then, what happened...

876
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,247
is that Jen starts crying
the most I've ever seen her cry

877
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,499
in 15 years of knowing each other.

878
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,003
I... I go, "Clo, what's wrong?"

879
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:06,174
She says, "I need the pretzels now!"

880
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:14,892
So, I sprint to the store
like a snack-food superhero,

881
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:18,312
and I take photos
of three types of pretzels,

882
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,357
and I text them to her,
and she writes back, "All of them!"

883
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,697
And I wrote,
"I saved your best friend's life."

884
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,080
My neighbor spots me
photographing the pretzels.

885
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,125
He goes, "Mike, what are you doing?"
It was early, we weren't telling people.

886
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,045
So I had to be like,
"This is something I'm into.

887
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,175
I got a lot of secrets, Tony!"

888
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,598
He said, "When my wife was pregnant,
she craved pretzels."

889
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,308
I said, "That's irrelevant."

890
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,234
That's all she could eat for a while,
was pretzels.

891
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:07,819
She had this awful morning sickness,

892
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,740
and it continued into the second
trimester, which is more rare.

893
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:16,495
So then, we're Googling,
"What happens when it doesn't stop?"

894
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,579
-And...

895
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,540
The internet's like, "That isn't a thing."

896
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,168
And we're like, "But it's happening."

897
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:25,754
And it's like, "Try the other internet."

898
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:28,382
And we're like, "There isn't one."

899
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,342
And it's like, "Exactly."

900
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:31,969
-And then...

901
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,054
Jen said, "I found this one site

902
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:38,225
that says that blowjobs
can cure morning sickness."

903
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,604
Which wasn't on WebMD. It was just...

904
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,191
in the comment section. You know...

905
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:51,154
Heroes aren't always the people
you expect.

906
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,910
It's not just the firemen
or the first responders.

907
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,495
-Sometimes...

908
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,999
it's a guy with a laptop
and a convincing username.

909
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,133
One night, Jen wakes me up
in the middle of the night,

910
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,969
and she says, "I'm bleeding.<i> </i>A lot."

911
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:14,970
And we jump in a cab.

912
00:50:15,053 --> 00:50:17,305
We rush to the hospital
and the doctor explains

913
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,599
that it's her placenta that's bleeding.

914
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,060
And I said, "Is it gonna be okay?"

915
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,187
And she said, "Its going to bleed more,

916
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,940
or it's gonna stop bleeding."

917
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:35,449
I thought, "That's like what I would say
if I was pretending to be a doctor."

918
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,537
Like,"It's gonna bleed more

919
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,497
or less!

920
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:45,876
I prefer cash!"

921
00:50:50,797 --> 00:50:53,842
The bleeding continued for weeks,
and on top of the bleeding,

922
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,343
Jen had hypermobile hips,

923
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:59,264
which meant she might break
or dislocate her hip during labor,

924
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,683
which is obviously not great timing.

925
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:02,851
-And we were...

926
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:06,772
so worried that we went
to this holistic birthing education class,

927
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,523
which wasn't a great fit,

928
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:10,567
because it was too much optimism for us

929
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,235
-at that moment.

930
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,989
The instructor was like,
"What's the most exciting thing

931
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,325
about having baby?"

932
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:21,620
Which is a new thing for us
where they don't say "the" baby,

933
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,623
they're just like, "Baby!"

934
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:28,001
We were like, " We just want baby to live.

935
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,129
We don't... we don't have high
hopes for this thing,

936
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,632
'cause we went to hospital,

937
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,634
-and...

938
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:38,845
we spoke with doctor, and...

939
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:43,141
she did test, and it's touch-and-go
at moment. And that...

940
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,146
That wasn't anyone else's answer.

941
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:51,942
One lady was like, "I just want
to hold baby skin-to-skin."

942
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:56,613
And one lady is like, "I just want to see
the world through baby's eyes."

943
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,407
And I was like, "See the world
through baby's eyes?

944
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,618
How did you make this about you?

945
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,161
-It's another person!

946
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,580
Now you've invented
this futuristic eye surgery?

947
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,708
Get a hold of yourself!
What happens if the baby is blind?"

948
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,711
Feel so bad for himself,

949
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,132
like, "My mom only had me
for my baby's eyes.

950
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,676
They don't even work!"

951
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:23,515
At one point, the instructor says,
"When baby comes out,

952
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,601
they'll try to take her away
and check her vitals...

953
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,813
but don't let them."

954
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,818
I was like, "I think I'm gonna let them.

955
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,321
They're called "vitals," not "optionals."

956
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:41,908
I think I might go with the grain
on that one."

957
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,580
One night, we were walking home
from birthing class,

958
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,290
and Jen starts making out with me,

959
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,084
because the same hormone
that causes hypermobile hips

960
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,627
causes some people to crave sex.

961
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:55,797
And so, we got home, we have
this magically pregnant sex

962
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,885
with all these contractions
and these very loose hips.

963
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,388
It was like having sex
with Space Mountain.

964
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,931
-I was like...

965
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,309
-"Hold on!"

966
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,021
We were both so worried
that any moment, she might give birth

967
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,274
-into my penis, which...

968
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,902
they never discussed in birthing class.

969
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:21,823
Like, "I just want to see penis
through baby's eyes."

970
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,371
In the third trimester,
the bleeding stopped,

971
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:31,499
which was a huge relief,
and the morning sickness went away.

972
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:34,336
And Jen started eating
like a college freshman.

973
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:38,548
Just hot dogs, and ice cream,
and mayonnaise.

974
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,302
At one point, she's eating
three hot dogs, all at once.

975
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,512
She's a vegetarian. And...

976
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:46,932
She looks up at me...

977
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,062
and she says,
"I feel like I understand you now."

978
00:53:57,317 --> 00:54:00,570
I said, "I think that's the most offensive
thing you've ever said to me.

979
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:05,158
Is that... is that how you have viewed me
all these years? Just...

980
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,745
this ogre who swallows
buckets of hot dogs,

981
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,205
and ice cream, and mayonnaise?"

982
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,083
Yeah, that's a part of me, but that's...

983
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,460
that's not the whole picture.

984
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,923
One morning, we were lying on the couch,

985
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,969
and we're sharing a pint of double
peanut-butter chocolate-chip ice cream,

986
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,054
and I'm rubbing Jen's shoulders,

987
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,599
and she says,
"It's hard for me to breathe,

988
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,142
or speak,

989
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:32,936
or move."

990
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,274
I said, "That really limits your options.
That's...

991
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,776
That's my big three."

992
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:43,571
She said, "I feel...

993
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,782
like a mammal."

994
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,246
I said, "You've always been a mammal.

995
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,166
We're both mammals. And, uh...

996
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,168
But what do you want to do?"

997
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:01,798
She said, "I want to go
to the Museum of Natural History...

998
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:05,051
with the other mammals."

999
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,849
So that's what we did.
We went to the Museum of Natural History.

1000
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:14,686
And I... and I took photos of Jen
with her exposed pregnant belly,

1001
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,354
next to porpoises,

1002
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:18,273
and walruses,

1003
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,734
and narwhals, and dolphins.

1004
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,529
Then we get to the big blue whale.

1005
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,076
And she says, "I want you to know...

1006
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:33,121
I know you never wanted to have a kid,

1007
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,292
and I want to make sure this doesn't
change the way we live our lives."

1008
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,838
And I said, "Thanks."

1009
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,968
And the next morning, at 10:04 a.m.,

1010
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,678
our daughter was born.

1011
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,639
Which is a reality-bending experience,

1012
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:54,309
because two colossal events
occurred simultaneously.

1013
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,936
One is that a human being
enters the Earth.

1014
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:00,482
And the second is that my wife,
this person I love and cherish

1015
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,275
and know better than anyone,

1016
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,319
in front of my eyes,

1017
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:06,613
becomes a mother.

1018
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,158
And I...

1019
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,827
pretty much stayed the same.

1020
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:23,797
And that was really the strangest part,

1021
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,216
because I'm watching this go down,

1022
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,427
and I'm thinking, "That's nuts.

1023
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,223
I don't know what I could possibly do
to help.

1024
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:38,061
I guess I'll just write an email
to anyone we've ever met,"

1025
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,523
which is the chief responsibility
of the dad.

1026
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:46,736
The mom births a living fire hydrant
through her vagina,

1027
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,032
and the dad knocks out an email
to his list.

1028
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:52,992
She does the physical.

1029
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,453
And I do the clerical.

1030
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,624
I forgot to write the email.

1031
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:01,793
-And...

1032
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,380
Not proud of it. Uh...

1033
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:08,049
I was stunned
for those first ten hours

1034
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,928
by the trippy hospital lights,
and chlorine smell,

1035
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,472
and I'm wearing the art school smock,
and the shower cap.

1036
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,850
At a certain point,
they hand me this monkey.

1037
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,436
And I'm like, "But we're humans."

1038
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,312
And they're like, "This is what it is."

1039
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,399
And then I'm like,
"Can we speak with a manager?"

1040
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:27,193
And they're like, "There isn't one."

1041
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,530
And I'm like, "That's the problem.
There's no accountability." And...

1042
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,866
And then you have to take it home.

1043
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,661
I mean, it's completely frowned upon
to leave it there. And...

1044
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,663
They tried to dress it up.

1045
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:41,875
They're like, "We'll put a striped blanket
on it, and a beanie.

1046
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,710
We'll make it look like E.T.

1047
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,546
You can give it a name."

1048
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,634
So we... so we called her Oona.

1049
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,511
Which means "one."

1050
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,347
As in, "We're only having one."

1051
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,019
I've been very clear.

1052
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,694
And then, we bring home this monkey.

1053
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,405
And she wouldn't sleep for a year.

1054
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,284
And that's when I remembered
I didn't want to have a kid.

1055
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,923
It's a little bit like this...

1056
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,968
where people send you...

1057
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,012
all this crap!

1058
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:40,141
They're like, "This is a chair
that shakes the baby!

1059
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:43,728
This is a blanket that smothers the baby!

1060
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:46,523
This is a Magic Sleepsuit!"

1061
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,441
This is an actual item.

1062
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:51,986
A Magic Sleepsuit!

1063
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,864
You're so desperate

1064
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,242
for your child to sleep...

1065
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,455
you'll believe...

1066
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:05,416
in magic!

1067
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,339
And that's not all! There's the Boppy!

1068
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:15,051
There's the Breast Friend,
which is what I thought I was!

1069
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,638
There's this worm!

1070
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,061
There's bibs, and balls, and binkies,

1071
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:28,982
and Slumber Buddies,
and a Baby Shusher,

1072
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,985
which is an owl that tells you
to stop talking.

1073
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:36,990
There's a Moses basket in case you want
to ship your baby down a river.

1074
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:44,789
There's rattles, and a rainstick
in case your baby's a shaman.

1075
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,300
And none of it works!

1076
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:01,347
Everybody tries to give you advice.

1077
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,642
They're like, "Have you tried
sounds of the ocean?"

1078
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,645
I'm like...  "Yes, we've tried
sounds of the ocean!"

1079
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,819
"Have you tried massaging her legs?"

1080
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,030
"Yes, we've tried
massaging her legs!"

1081
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,534
"She should be sleeping."

1082
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,870
"I know she should be sleeping!"

1083
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:31,085
My wife hasn't slept in weeks!

1084
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,048
Though I'm sleeping pretty well,
because...

1085
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,552
Well, I had a doctor's note.
As you know...

1086
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,598
I have a rare and dangerous
sleep disorder.

1087
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,600
And...

1088
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,269
And Jen... and Jen...

1089
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:49,896
Jen and I were...

1090
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,856
Jen and I were both very worried
about this.

1091
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,817
We went to my sleep doctor
after Oona was born,

1092
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,194
and we said, "Is this dangerous?"

1093
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:57,403
And he goes, "Oh, yeah!"

1094
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,784
He said there are people
who have REM behavior disorder

1095
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,744
who have dreams their son
is a football,

1096
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:06,913
and they kick them through the goalposts,

1097
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,873
which are above the fireplace.

1098
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,459
And I said, "I wish you hadn't put
that image in my brain,

1099
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:12,669
but I see your point."

1100
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:16,089
He said, "One thing you might consider

1101
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:18,132
is sleeping in a separate room

1102
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:21,928
from your wife and daughter,
and installing a chain lock

1103
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,097
from the inside."

1104
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:26,933
So we did that.

1105
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,895
And then, to supplement the sleeping bag,

1106
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,606
I created a fitted

1107
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:35,441
sleep sheet,

1108
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,610
that fits me

1109
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,655
into my mattress.

1110
01:01:42,532 --> 01:01:46,077
I cut out a hole for my head
and one for my wife,

1111
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,496
though she never used it, and then...

1112
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,044
I secured the sheet under the mattress
with a rope...

1113
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,213
and a camping clasp.

1114
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:01,426
And so, now, I'm like
a relatable Hannibal Lecter. And...

1115
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,389
This is real.

1116
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:07,390
And, uh...

1117
01:02:07,473 --> 01:02:08,808
Yeah, I brought this from home.

1118
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,269
This is a double-sided zipper,
in case I'm suffocating.

1119
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,146
So, that's fun. And, uh..

1120
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,775
I made this.

1121
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,195
I took it to the tailor on my corner.

1122
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,369
And I said, "Can you make more of these?"

1123
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,372
And he said, "No!"

1124
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:34,834
And he walked me out of the store,

1125
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,962
'cause he clearly thought it was
some kind of S&M sex sheet

1126
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:40,089
for Orthodox Jews, which it isn't.

1127
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,382
-It's a...

1128
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:44,302
It's a homemade medical device.

1129
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:47,096
You might remember
that we also have a cat.

1130
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,474
And, uh, her name is Mazzy,
and she was a street cat.

1131
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,893
And so, she wakes us up every morning

1132
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,937
by scratching our faces,
which is, I believe,

1133
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,191
a survival instinct from the streets,

1134
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,778
but in a domestic setting, it's much less
charming and can be dangerous.

1135
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,571
You can't have that around an infant,

1136
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,365
so we locked Mazzy
in the bedroom with me.

1137
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,577
You can see where this is going.

1138
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:11,162
And so, every morning,

1139
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:13,498
she wakes me up by scratching my face,

1140
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,249
but I can't protect myself,

1141
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:19,670
'cause my arms are bound by the sheet.

1142
01:03:19,754 --> 01:03:22,256
I'm like, "Outta here, street cat!

1143
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,717
Nobody wanted you!"

1144
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,512
And she's like,
"Well, well, well!

1145
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:30,473
Cat's got your arms!" And...

1146
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:34,977
If you have a cat, you know
that we had to keep the litter bin

1147
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,187
in the locked bedroom.

1148
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,355
In the first week,

1149
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:41,484
I forgot to scoop the litter,
and Mazzy peed on this linen chair.

1150
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,277
I don't know if you've smelled cat pee...

1151
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,906
but it's a little bit like
if regular pee...

1152
01:03:48,032 --> 01:03:48,866
took a shit.

1153
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,577
It's...

1154
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,870
It's the most...

1155
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:55,331
rancid smell.

1156
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,083
Before...

1157
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,377
Before we had Oona, Jen said to me,

1158
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:02,213
"This baby isn't gonna change the way...

1159
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:04,131
we live...

1160
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,008
our lives."

1161
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,969
And I feel like it has.

1162
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:09,595
-Because...

1163
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,722
I sleep in a straitjacket...

1164
01:04:12,723 --> 01:04:15,810
in a room that is chain-locked
from the inside,

1165
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,146
filled with cat litter dust and super pee,

1166
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:23,526
and every morning,
I'm awoken by a wild animal...

1167
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,530
that is trying to murder me in my sleep.

1168
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:32,660
I feel like this baby has changed
the way we live our lives.

1169
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:42,336
One morning, I'm walking home
from Rite Aid with cat litter and diapers,

1170
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,716
and I walk into our apartment,
and Jen is crying on the couch a lot,

1171
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:48,092
like "pretzels" level.

1172
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:52,930
And I say, "Clo,

1173
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:54,974
what's wrong?"

1174
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:59,812
And she says, "Oona is never gonna be
in my belly again."

1175
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,900
That's how close

1176
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,484
Jen and Oona were.

1177
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,194
One day, I found this.

1178
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:11,532
This is a... a short poem
that Jen had written.

1179
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:14,035
This is one of her actual
poetry notebooks.

1180
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,995
This is called <i>Little Astronaut.</i>

1181
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,790
"A newborn rests her head
on the earth of mother.

1182
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:23,502
Everything else is outer space."

1183
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,841
This is the most profound level of love...

1184
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:31,344
I had ever witnessed.

1185
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,350
And I was there, too.

1186
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,857
It's almost like I didn't know
what "nothing" meant

1187
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:46,651
until I became a dad.

1188
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:50,655
And then, I was like,
"Oh, that's what nothing is."

1189
01:05:51,155 --> 01:05:52,615
I was so nothing.

1190
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:56,953
I was this pudgy, milkless
vice-president of the family.

1191
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:01,457
Huge title, no power.

1192
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:04,585
Also oversees Congress.

1193
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,087
My whole job...

1194
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:08,255
was to be around

1195
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:10,132
and have no opinions.

1196
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:15,429
Like, if I expressed a hint of an opinion,
everyone was like, "What's that?"

1197
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:18,182
I'd be like,
"I was just mumbling to myself...

1198
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,643
about the news." Like...

1199
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,521
I was the intern of my own family.

1200
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:26,524
I was like, "Does anyone need coffee?

1201
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:28,985
I'll clean up your crap.

1202
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,989
Someday, I hope to be a member
of the family." And...

1203
01:06:34,448 --> 01:06:37,201
I was a good intern. I showed up on time,

1204
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:40,663
I worked hard, but it would always be
junior level activities.

1205
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,498
Jen would put Oona down for a nap,

1206
01:06:42,748 --> 01:06:45,334
stick her in the stroller
and say, "Take her for a walk,

1207
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,795
and when she wakes up,
return immediately."

1208
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,674
So I would do that.
When I wasn't interning,

1209
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,843
I was on the road,
in every Applebee's with a dream.

1210
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,137
And one night,
I'm in Weatherford, Oklahoma,

1211
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,557
which is a direct flight from nowhere,
which is why, after the show,

1212
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,059
I drove a rental car
four-and-a-half hours down to Dallas.

1213
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:03,811
I caught the first flight in the morning,

1214
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:06,856
but we were delayed
from thunderstorms all... all day, so...

1215
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:11,193
After 26 hours of travel,
I walk in our apartment at 1:00 a.m.,

1216
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:15,281
and I make my way
through the living room.

1217
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,450
And I'm drenched,

1218
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:19,827
and exhausted,

1219
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,454
and empty.

1220
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:23,039
And I get...

1221
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,082
to the couch.

1222
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,085
And Oona is asleep...

1223
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,296
on the couch.

1224
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:32,840
And I tiptoe

1225
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:34,884
into the kitchen.

1226
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,178
And I say, "Clo,

1227
01:07:38,637 --> 01:07:40,097
it's not a big deal,

1228
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:43,434
but that's my couch."

1229
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,859
Jen says, "Great news.

1230
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,612
That's where Oona likes to sleep."

1231
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,615
I said, "I totally get it.

1232
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,328
As a short-term solution,
I think that's phenomenal,

1233
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:06,791
but long-term,
I think Oona should sleep in a crib."

1234
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,961
Jen said, "We decided
that Oona doesn't like to sleep

1235
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:12,505
in a crib."

1236
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:17,093
I said, "Who's in 'we'?"

1237
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:21,639
She said, "Me and Oona."

1238
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,268
I said, "I'm not in 'we' anymore?

1239
01:08:26,644 --> 01:08:29,146
I'm a founding member of 'we'."

1240
01:08:31,315 --> 01:08:34,568
It is a shocking revelation
when you are evicted...

1241
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,363
from your own life.

1242
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:41,367
So I decide I'm gonna win back my wife...

1243
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,077
from my daughter.

1244
01:08:44,453 --> 01:08:46,455
The next day,
we're strolling Oona through the park,

1245
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,999
and I said, "I was thinking
we should set aside one night a week

1246
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,209
and get a babysitter."

1247
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,963
And Jen looked at me like I was suggesting
we sell Oona into slavery,

1248
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,590
and then, Oona starts screaming,

1249
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,093
like the meanest heckler
I've ever encountered.

1250
01:08:59,176 --> 01:09:00,970
Like, a heckler
not only hates what I'm saying,

1251
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:03,848
but every word individually
in any context, and...

1252
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:08,561
Jen looks at me and says,
"Oona doesn't like it when we talk."

1253
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:17,528
This baby isn't gonna change
the way we live our lives...

1254
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,989
but she doesn't like it when we talk.

1255
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,284
And then she started to talk
when she was six months old.

1256
01:09:23,367 --> 01:09:24,952
Jen said, "Hi!"

1257
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,871
And then, Oona said, "Hi."

1258
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,664
And I said, "Hi!"

1259
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:29,915
And Oona said...

1260
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,046
When she was eight months old,

1261
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,132
Jen wrote this...

1262
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:44,013
"An infant reaches for something.
I don't know what.

1263
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:45,389
Pushes it farther away

1264
01:09:45,472 --> 01:09:48,184
and cries in frustration
each time she reaches,

1265
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,187
without realizing
she is crawling for the first time.

1266
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,731
She is just like her father."

1267
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,489
That's a poetry burn. And...

1268
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:06,535
When she was 13 months old,
she was teething.

1269
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,413
As far as we could tell,
she was growing 234 teeth.

1270
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:13,542
The only time she wouldn't scream
was when she was suckling my wife's boob

1271
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:15,461
with her freaky shark teeth.

1272
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,506
One morning, we're at the kitchen table,
and Oona is just sucking all the life,

1273
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:22,801
and food, and energy out of my wife.

1274
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:24,929
Which is what I want to do.

1275
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:27,348
But I can't,

1276
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,934
'cause I'm doing the dishes.

1277
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,938
She says, "You're doing a great job."
And I say, "Thanks."

1278
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:35,856
Sometimes, I'm not sure.

1279
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:38,859
She says, "Not you."

1280
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:46,575
Cool!

1281
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:52,957
Two hours later, Jen has to pee,
and she hands Oona to me.

1282
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,627
The moment I take her, it was like holding
the angriest thing I'd ever held.

1283
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,921
It was like... it was like holding my dad.

1284
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,385
She was like...

1285
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,847
I was like, "How do you think I feel?
I don't know what I'm doing.

1286
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,516
I don't know anything."

1287
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,018
At that moment,
the church bells on our corner

1288
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:15,479
start chiming the song <i>Ave Maria.</i>

1289
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,315
</i>

1290
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,695
And she stops crying.

1291
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:24,738
Looks up.

1292
01:11:25,906 --> 01:11:27,366
Starts bobbing her head.

1293
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,160
I said, "I know.

1294
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,288
It's a classic."

1295
01:11:34,248 --> 01:11:35,582
She's bobbing her head,

1296
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:38,127
and I'm thinking,
"She's got a really good rhythm.

1297
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:41,046
Maybe she could be a drummer, or a DJ,

1298
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,299
or an agreeable person.

1299
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,926
Maybe this'll help her sleep.

1300
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:48,262
She won't need the Slumber Buddies,

1301
01:11:48,345 --> 01:11:50,180
or the Dream Dust, or the...

1302
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,100
Magic Sleepsuit.

1303
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:56,020
And the song ends.

1304
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,605
She's looking at me,
and I'm looking at her,

1305
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:00,107
and we both know...

1306
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:02,985
it's about to go down.

1307
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:07,740
So, I go...

1308
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:14,788
<i>♪ Ave Maria ♪</i>

1309
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,669
<i>♪ Ave ♪</i>

1310
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,088
<i>♪ Maria ♪</i>

1311
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,424
I don't know the words, and so I go...

1312
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,594
<i>♪ There will be a Jesus ♪</i>

1313
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,763
<i>♪ In your womb ♪</i>

1314
01:12:31,221 --> 01:12:33,849
<i>♪ It's actually a pretty big</i> <i>honor ♪</i>

1315
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:36,769
<i>♪ It's more like an Oscar than an Emmy ♪</i>

1316
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,521
Eventually, I run out of lyrics,

1317
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,316
and she's staring at me,
and I'm bracing myself,

1318
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,526
and she looks me in the eyes and says,

1319
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:45,986
"Dada."

1320
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:46,987
Aww.

1321
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,323
For that moment,
I was the pudgy, milkless vice-president

1322
01:12:49,406 --> 01:12:51,867
with record high approval ratings
for no reason.

1323
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:57,206
Ten hours later, I'm back on the road,
but this time, I have the flu.

1324
01:12:57,289 --> 01:12:58,707
And when I get the flu,

1325
01:12:59,249 --> 01:13:01,835
it is worse
than when other people get the flu.

1326
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,591
I'm backstage
at the Byham Theater in Pittsburgh.

1327
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,719
I'm lying on the floor in the darkness.

1328
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,639
My cheek is pushed up
against the cold tile,

1329
01:13:13,806 --> 01:13:16,308
my throat feels
like I've swallowed broken glass,

1330
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,560
and the tour manager
opens the door a crack.

1331
01:13:18,685 --> 01:13:20,229
He says, "Mike, we have to start."

1332
01:13:20,312 --> 01:13:21,855
And I roll off the floor,

1333
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:25,692
and I hobble onto the stage.
I didn't know what to do.

1334
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:27,986
I was looking at the audience
like I'm looking at you now,

1335
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,114
thinking, "Should I tell them?"

1336
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:33,033
Like, what would Springsteen do?

1337
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:37,746
Like, "This might take the fun
out of 'I'm on Fire'...

1338
01:13:38,914 --> 01:13:41,875
but my ass is on fire. Here we go!"

1339
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:44,461
Everyone would be, like, "Bruce, no!"

1340
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,466
I made it through,
but the next morning, I'm even sicker.

1341
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,927
And I'm driving home,
I pull over to Starbucks,

1342
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,345
I don't mean to be crude,

1343
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,014
to use the restroom aggressively.

1344
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,852
Which I believe is the rudest thing
one can do

1345
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,437
at someone's place of business.

1346
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,356
They're like, "We've got muffins,
we can make you a latte."

1347
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,984
-You're like, "That's all well and good...

1348
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:08,569
but what I'm gonna do...

1349
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:12,573
is go into this private room
you have in the back

1350
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:15,117
and unload the most vile substance

1351
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:19,580
my body's been able to conjure
in 39 years of existence.

1352
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:23,500
Then I'm gonna leave
and I'm not gonna purchase anything.

1353
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:27,713
And I'm gonna drive
as far away from this location

1354
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,465
as physically possible

1355
01:14:29,798 --> 01:14:31,884
to forget this ever happened.

1356
01:14:33,552 --> 01:14:35,179
Do you have the code?"

1357
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:39,141
So now...

1358
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:44,396
Now I'm driving,
I'm sweaty and flu-ish.

1359
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:46,857
After seven hours,
I walk into our apartment,

1360
01:14:46,940 --> 01:14:51,069
I collapse on our beloved couch,
and it hugs me.

1361
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:55,491
Jen walks in, who has the sweetest,
softest, thread-counted voice.

1362
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:57,075
And says,

1363
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:01,288
"Get the fuck off the couch!"

1364
01:15:03,540 --> 01:15:04,374
I said...

1365
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,001
I said, "Clo,

1366
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:07,878
I have the flu."

1367
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:11,131
She said, "If Oona gets the flu,
I'm gonna be up all night

1368
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:12,508
holding her until my arm is numb,

1369
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,718
using the other arm
to rummage through the darkness

1370
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:16,678
for the baby Tylenol and the thermometer.

1371
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,681
And I've tried to make it so this doesn't
change the way we live our lives.

1372
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:20,891
I don't wake you up,

1373
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,102
I change the diapers, I give her baths,
but right now,

1374
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,146
you're in the way."

1375
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:31,527
You tell that story about me
breastfeeding at the kitchen table,

1376
01:15:31,818 --> 01:15:33,654
and the only part that isn't true...

1377
01:15:34,863 --> 01:15:36,490
is that you do the dishes."

1378
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,918
I roll off the couch,

1379
01:15:49,253 --> 01:15:51,171
and I walk into my dungeon,

1380
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:55,175
and I lock the door.2

1381
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:00,305
And I get into my straitjacket...

1382
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:10,190
and I can't believe my own thought.

1383
01:16:12,317 --> 01:16:13,277
I think,

1384
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:16,989
"I get why Dads leave."

1385
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,577
And I'm only comfortable saying that,

1386
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,580
because I'm not gonna leave.

1387
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:27,207
I love my wife.

1388
01:16:28,792 --> 01:16:30,294
And where would I go?

1389
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:37,426
Who's gonna zip up my sleeping bag?

1390
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:39,428
I'm not gonna be out on the town,

1391
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:42,723
like, "What do you say we get out of here,
and you put on my mittens?"

1392
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:46,435
"Do you mean a condom?"
"Not exactly."

1393
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:50,147
I'm comfortable saying it,
'cause I'm not gonna leave,

1394
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:51,898
but for the first time in my life,
I get it.

1395
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:55,444
And I know that's a sensitive subject.
especially if your dad left.

1396
01:16:55,527 --> 01:16:59,615
But if your dad left, I want you to know
it is not because of you.

1397
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,034
It's because...

1398
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:03,493
you exist.

1399
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:09,041
And I'm gonna clarify that,
'cause it's a very subtle distinction.

1400
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:12,419
It's not because of your personality,
or that you don't deserve love.

1401
01:17:12,502 --> 01:17:15,213
It's that your dad
maybe didn't want to be a dad,

1402
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,966
and he doesn't understand causality
that well.

1403
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:23,138
And now, you're alive.

1404
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:26,016
And I think that's great.

1405
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:30,812
So who cares if your dad's around,
'cause who needs a guy like that anyway?

1406
01:17:36,443 --> 01:17:37,569
That said...

1407
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:43,283
I get it.

1408
01:17:46,244 --> 01:17:49,039
Because this person who I have sworn
to spend the rest of my life with,

1409
01:17:49,122 --> 01:17:51,750
this person who I've spent thousands
of hours on a couch with,

1410
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:54,127
who has saved my best friend's life...

1411
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,466
is in the greatest love affair
of her entire life

1412
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,927
that I'm watching through a window.

1413
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:04,805
And all day, people come up to me
and they say,

1414
01:18:04,888 --> 01:18:07,140
"Is it the most joy
you've ever experienced?"

1415
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:08,684
And I have to say,

1416
01:18:09,142 --> 01:18:10,769
"It's the most joy.

1417
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,690
I didn't know what joy was...

1418
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,483
until now.

1419
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:19,277
And now I know what it is.

1420
01:18:20,487 --> 01:18:21,530
It's this."

1421
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:26,159
I'm literally empty bones,
and garbage, and Diet Coke,

1422
01:18:26,243 --> 01:18:27,828
and people say, "Are you full?"

1423
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:29,955
I have to say,

1424
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:31,998
"I'm so full."

1425
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,671
So I fall asleep and I have the best sleep
I've had in a year,

1426
01:18:37,754 --> 01:18:40,632
because I've accidentally
locked Mazzy out of the bedroom.

1427
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,473
And in the morning,
I wake up and I open the door,

1428
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:52,352
and I smell the most unmistakable,

1429
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:54,604
heinous stench,

1430
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:58,316
because Mazzy has peed all over the couch.

1431
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,943
- Oh.
-I know.

1432
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:03,321
So, I order a pizza...

1433
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:08,702
to compete with the smell,

1434
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,829
and when the delivery guy shows up,

1435
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,999
I pay him $20 to carry the couch with me

1436
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,127
out to the street.

1437
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,547
And that's where it died.

1438
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:24,259
I'm in the bedroom for four days
with the flu,

1439
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:25,427
and on the fifth day,

1440
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,971
I wander out at 4:30 in the morning.

1441
01:19:28,847 --> 01:19:30,557
And I wander into the kitchen.

1442
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:33,560
And I do the dishes.

1443
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,438
And I enjoy it.

1444
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,568
That week, Jen started writing poems
for Oona

1445
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,820
for when she gets older,
and I found...

1446
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:45,739
this.

1447
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:50,827
"Oona...

1448
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:55,207
in our house, there is always
a congregation of ants

1449
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:57,375
summiting around a noodle,

1450
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:01,379
or carrying their weight in popcorn
across the kitchen floor.

1451
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:04,633
And in the sink,
there is always a pile of dishes.

1452
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,092
But this morning,

1453
01:20:06,843 --> 01:20:07,886
your father...

1454
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:09,596
did the dishes.

1455
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:13,183
And it made me want to fuck him."

1456
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,733
And I'd like to think that was for me.

1457
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:28,740
That week, we took Oona...

1458
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,826
to a department store,

1459
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,744
and she spots this couch.

1460
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:33,870
It was blue.

1461
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,289
My wife thinks it's green.

1462
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,500
I looked it up...

1463
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:40,335
"Lagoon."

1464
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:45,507
Oona loves the couch. She goes, "Couch!

1465
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:48,218
Wug!

1466
01:20:49,803 --> 01:20:51,638
Piwwow!"

1467
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,599
She's a genius.

1468
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:02,649
The three of us sit on the couch
in the department store.

1469
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:05,569
Oona is hiding behind each of us.

1470
01:21:05,652 --> 01:21:08,697
And we go, "Where's Oona? Where's Oona?"
She's clinging into my back as I spin.

1471
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:10,949
The more she clings,
the more I'm committing. Like...

1472
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:13,410
"Where is Oona? Where is she?"

1473
01:21:14,411 --> 01:21:16,037
And she starts laughing so hard,

1474
01:21:16,121 --> 01:21:18,748
like the hardest I've ever seen anyone
laugh in my whole life,

1475
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,834
and I'm in the jokes business.

1476
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:25,213
At this idea that she's tricking us,

1477
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:28,925
the people in power,
the people who know everything.

1478
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:31,094
She's fooled us completely,
at least this once.

1479
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:33,096
And look, I know she's gonna grow up

1480
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:35,348
and find out that the Earth is sinking
into the ocean,

1481
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,560
and we might have to live
in an almond milk jug in Pennsylvania,

1482
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:39,561
-and...

1483
01:21:39,644 --> 01:21:41,354
people can be horrible,

1484
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:43,899
but as I'm staring
at this monkey on a couch,

1485
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:48,320
I feel like she might be one of the people
who changes that trajectory.

1486
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:52,741
She's laughing so hard
that I start laughing in a new...

1487
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,119
way, from my perspective,
and Jen's perspective,

1488
01:21:56,202 --> 01:21:58,830
and Oona's perspective all at once.
We're laughing...

1489
01:22:00,123 --> 01:22:00,999
as one.

1490
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,419
And in that moment,

1491
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:08,715
I feel...

1492
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:10,717
full.

1493
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,347
I've seen the world...

1494
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,401
through baby's eyes.
