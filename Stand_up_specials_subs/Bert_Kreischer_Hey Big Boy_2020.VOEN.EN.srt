1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,940
Ladies and gentlemen... Bert Kreischer!

2
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,460
Yeah!

3
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,750
What's up?

4
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,340
Cleveland!

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,180
I took a shit in a gender-neutral bathroom
the other day...

6
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,600
that made the woman in the stall
next to me question her politics.

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,030
She walked in progressive left...

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,940
walked out with a MAGA hat on, just...

9
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,990
In all fairness,
I do shit fairly aggressively.

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,620
I shit on the underside of the seat.

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,210
You ever gotten that blowback where you...

12
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,550
Your wife lifts up the seat,
and it's got freckles underneath it?

13
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,510
I'm a tough guy to live with.

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,050
I piss her off.
She got mad at me the other day.

15
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,616
By the way, this will split the room.
Some people will be like,

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,810
"I don't see anything wrong with it,"
and some will be like, "What the fuck?"

17
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,810
I put my dick on her shoulder. Now...

18
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,940
Ladies, ladies, ladies...

19
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:33,980
I'm all about progress.

20
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,630
But I don't want to live in a world
where a man in his own house

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,070
can't sneak up behind his wife...

22
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,200
while she's reading a magazine,

23
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,620
take his dick out, put it on her shoulder,

24
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,870
and go, "Whoo! Polly want a cracker!"
Now...

25
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,800
Dude, she called me out at a dinner party.

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,340
She told strangers about it.

27
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,930
By the way, I was in the hole
at this dinner party, right out the gates.

28
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,670
This lady I didn't know was telling us
the difference between a broom and a mop.

29
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,560
Yeah, I wish you had been there.

30
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,576
In the middle, I just started giggling,

31
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,666
"I can't believe
we're talking about this right now."

32
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,280
She goes, "I bet Bert doesn't know
the difference between a broom and a mop."

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,780
My wife held onto her seat, like,
"You're not gonna like his answer."

34
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,596
I leaned into the table. I go, "No, I know
the difference between a broom and a mop.

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,950
It's really hard to beat your wife
with a mop."

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,170
You know when other men look at you,

37
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,170
like, "I would love to be on your team
right now.

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,500
That's not gonna happen."

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,880
My wife then just chimes in,
"He put his dick on my shoulder...

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,140
and pretended it was a parrot!"

41
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,100
I was like, "That's not what happened.

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,680
It was a cockatiel."

43
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,690
I live in LA.

44
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,400
People take getting offended
in LA to an art form.

45
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:58,150
Dude, in LA,
they get offended on behalf of people.

46
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,030
Bro, I go to the Starbucks by my house
the other day, right?

47
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,716
I walk in, there's this young black kid
working behind the counter,

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,250
and he recognizes me.
Now, first off, I love getting recognized.

49
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,040
But I love getting recognized
by black people.

50
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:15,380
It's so much better, the way they do it.
It's more excited.

51
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,960
Like, "Shit!"

52
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,050
This kid's working behind the counter,
I walk in and he goes, "Shit!"

53
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,220
I'm like, "This is gonna be
a good one."

54
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,770
I walk through the line,
and by the time I get up to the counter,

55
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,980
he's already bubbling.

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,360
He's like, "Dawg, dawg, dawg,
you have no idea!"

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,650
I was like,
"I have a little idea right now."

58
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,400
He's like, "No, my man, my dude. Man!

59
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,780
I am the biggest fan

60
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,070
of Joe Rogan's."

61
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,080
I'm like, "Cool, is he here?"

62
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,630
He's like, "No, but you know him!"

63
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,460
I'm like, "Yeah, I do."

64
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,670
He's like, "That's so cool, man."

65
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,220
He goes, "Hey, the best comedians
in the game right now,

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,640
Joe Rogan, Bill Burr, and Tom Segura."

67
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,520
I'm literally standing
right in front of him, and I just go...

68
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,270
"What about me?"

69
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,820
And he's like, "Nah."

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,530
He's like, "Hey, man,
I tried getting into your shit,

71
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,910
but see, the problem with you is
you laugh at your own jokes."

72
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,080
By the way, he's accurate.
I do laugh at my own jokes.

73
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,750
I've done it, I will do it. Fuck him,
I'm having a good time. Anyway...

74
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,380
Now you can tell the conversation's
not going the way he had planned on it.

75
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,630
And he looks at me,
and he goes, "Hey, man,

76
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,630
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."

77
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,550
I go, "You didn't hurt my feelings.
Those are my three closest friends.

78
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,890
I'm gonna tell them
about this interaction,

79
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,720
and they're gonna love it."

80
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,730
He's like, "You'd do that?"
I go, "I'm definitely doing that."

81
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,770
He's like, "Aw, cool, man.
What can I get you?"

82
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,440
I go, "I'll just have a Venti coffee."

83
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,780
He's like, "Room for cream?"
I go, "No, I want it thugged out."

84
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
He's like, "" I said, "Black."

85
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,290
And he starts laughing, and I lean in.

86
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,080
I go, "I didn't laugh that time,
did I, motherfucker?"

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,840
Yeah.

88
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,380
And then I started laughing too
'cause I laugh at my own jokes!

89
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,350
Both of us are laughing hard as shit,
right? He hands me my coffee and goes,

90
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,890
"All right, I was wrong about you.
You're funny."

91
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,980
I was like, "Yeah, I know."

92
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,650
I go home, I tell my wife about it.
She thinks it's funny.

93
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,440
I come back the next day.
Exact same scenario.

94
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,190
I walk in, kid sees me,

95
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,320
"Shit!"

96
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,070
I'm like,
"Yeah, it's Groundhog Day, baby."

97
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,870
I get through the line, but this time,
when I get up to the counter,

98
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,950
he's already laughing hysterically.

99
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,630
He's giggling. He's like...

100
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,590
"How you doing, man?" I go, "Good."

101
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,670
He goes, "What can I get you today?"

102
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,670
I go, "I'll just have a Venti coffee."

103
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,840
He's like,"

104
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,720
Room for cream?"

105
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,350
I go, "No, I want it to be pulled over
for no reason at all."

106
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,440
And the kid falls out laughing, right?

107
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:25,070
And I laugh too
'cause I laugh at my own fucking jokes.

108
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,450
But now we're laughing like a team.

109
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:31,620
Like two buddies who have an inside joke.

110
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,450
And what's making him laugh harder
is watching me laugh.

111
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,910
We're matching each other's energy
like two gay lovers in a steam room.

112
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:44,250
He hands me my coffee,
grabs my wrist, and he goes, "Hey,

113
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,880
am I gonna see you tomorrow?"

114
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,340
I was like, "You're damn right
you'll see me tomorrow."

115
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,930
I was up all night
writing jokes for this kid.

116
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,730
Yeah, I fucked myself 'cause he already
knows the structure to the joke.

117
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,350
He already knows the setup.

118
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,270
That's 90% of the work right there.

119
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,030
You know he's been guessing punchlines
all day, handing out coffees,

120
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,030
like, "Here's your coffee. Taking a knee
during the National Anthem. Enjoy it."

121
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,700
Yeah, I got to bring the thunder.
I'm a professional comedian.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,410
I owe it to this kid.

123
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,660
He just found out I was funny
two days ago.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,880
The thing about a joke... Not that you
don't know this, but I'll reinforce it.

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,720
It's got to be the last thing you think
I would say. That's why you laugh.

126
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,180
So I show up at Starbucks the next day,
right? Starbucks is packed.

127
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,180
Kid sees me walk in
and works his way over to the register,

128
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,180
like, "I got the next ten customers!"

129
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,690
I am nervous in line 'cause I'm
watching him alert all his coworkers,

130
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,360
like, "Get Bradley out of the back.
It's going down.

131
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,360
Cathy, stop making coffees.
It's happening.

132
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,570
Fat guy, red hoodie. Fat guy, red hoodie."

133
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,660
I'm going over my set list in my head.

134
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,530
And I got these two older white women...

135
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,830
Not "older." They're my wife's age.
Whatever, fuck 'em. Anyway...

136
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,040
They're...
They're talking about rescuing whippets

137
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,590
or whatever white women talk about.
I don't know.

138
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,970
All I know is I'm trying to focus because,
by the time I get up to the counter,

139
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,720
the first thing I notice
is all his coworkers

140
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,430
are clustered behind him...

141
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,850
just listening. No one's making coffee!

142
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,310
And the kid is in front of them,
visibly nervous.

143
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,270
He's like, "Good day, sir."

144
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,150
Now I'm nervous.
I'm like, "Good day to you."

145
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,690
He's like, "What can I get you today?"

146
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm like, "...

147
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,530
I think I'll just have a Venti coffee."

148
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,160
He's like...

149
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,330
"Room for cream?"

150
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,000
I go,
"No, I don't want it to know its father."

151
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,170
And the kid falls on the ground laughing.

152
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,680
His coworkers are behind him, like,
"Shit, he brought the thunder, man."

153
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,810
I start laughing.

154
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,940
And the white woman next to me goes,
"What did you just say to him?"

155
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,950
"I don't want my coffee
to know its father."

156
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,290
She's like,
"What is that supposed to mean?"

157
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,500
And the kid gets up,
leans over the counter and goes,

158
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,040
"It means he wants it black!"

159
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,590
I am crying laughing.

160
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,840
The kid has snot coming out of his nose.

161
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,640
And she gets offended.

162
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,230
"How dare you talk to him in that manner?
I won't allow that. Not on my watch.

163
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,600
I'll take care of this, son."

164
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,110
And I lean into the kid, and I go,
"That's the problem with cream."

165
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,200
That just...

166
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Cheers.

167
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,370
Whoa.

168
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:09,630
That's a lot stronger
than I thought it would be.

169
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Whoo.

170
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,000
Jesus Christ.

171
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,670
Yeah, Bert, we love you!

172
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,880
I love you too.

173
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:19,970
Whoo!

174
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,140
I love my wife. I wish I didn't.

175
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,890
I do, man. She's a bad bitch.

176
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,560
She's an honest person.
Here's the thing about women.

177
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,810
When women are honest...
This is what sucks.

178
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,520
They get written off as bitches.

179
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,700
But when a dude's honest, they're like,
"Savage, man, way to get 'em!"

180
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,570
My wife is brutally...

181
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,120
My wife is autistically honest.

182
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,290
Dude, I was getting undressed
in the bedroom the other day,

183
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:53,090
and, through the doorway, I hear her go...

184
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,720
Like, is that for me? And she goes,
"You do not look good naked. Like...

185
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,850
Baby, it looks like
you're still wearing a belt.

186
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:06,060
When you get naked, it's like your body...

187
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,770
It looks like you outgrew your dick.

188
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,560
It looks like your body got bigger,
but your dick stayed the same size, so...

189
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,551
It looks like a squatter
in the middle of a bustling city.

190
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,900
Like, 'Hell, no, we won't go.

191
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,990
Hell...'"

192
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,870
Dude, I was in the grocery store with her
the other day.

193
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,120
And I was getting this weird sensation
in my dick.

194
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,660
It's going ice cold, then hot,
then ice cold, then hot.

195
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,540
I started panicking. I go,
"Something's going on with my dick, baby.

196
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,760
It goes cold then hot, cold then hot..."
And she just cuts me off and goes,

197
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,300
"You have to lose weight."

198
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,930
I go, "Do you think
it's my blood pressure?"

199
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,640
She's like, "No, it is out of your pants."

200
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,980
I couldn't see it.

201
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,610
And there it was like a hood ornament,
just... Shut the fuck up.

202
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,030
Like Rose in the Titanic.

203
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,290
It was getting cold
in the frozen food section.

204
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,460
I'm such an idiot.
I'm opening the ice cream door,

205
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,460
like, "It's happening again. God.

206
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:21,010
Should we get baby aspirin?
I think I'm having a stroke.

207
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,050
No, never mind. It's going. It's gone."

208
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,560
My wife saw her first porn the other day.
Let me rephrase that.

209
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,020
My wife caught me
watching porn the other day...

210
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,150
in the worst way
anyone's ever gotten caught watching porn.

211
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:39,070
I guarantee it.
11:30 on a Tuesday afternoon.

212
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,070
I'm in the closet. Now...

213
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,820
I don't even know how it started.

214
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,200
I don't know how I got into it.

215
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,790
All of a sudden, I'm in it, though.
I'm on my phone, scrolling.

216
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,750
Because I broke my governor
when I was a kid.

217
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,910
Now nothing turns me on.

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,920
I'm like, "Give me a tentacle
or quicksand. Something real.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,090
Knock the wind out of someone.
Something I can gravitate to."

220
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,800
I hear her walking into the closet.
Phone in the pocket, she didn't see that.

221
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,970
She looks at me and says,
"What were you just doing on your phone?"

222
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,430
I'm on my heels, I got this.
I go, "I was replying to work e-mails."

223
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,130
She goes, "Really? Are you sure
you weren't watching a video

224
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,940
called No Mercy for My Throat?"

225
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,700
Now I'm thinking,
"That is really specific for a guess."

226
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,530
But I stood my ground. I go, "No."

227
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,910
And she goes, "Dickhead, your phone's
tethered to the TV in the bedroom."

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,920
She had been watching me flip through
all the porns I deemed boring.

229
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,170
"Girl on girl? What is this, eighth grade?

230
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,260
Guy, girl? What am I, gay?
Come on, give me something real.

231
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,680
Ooh, No Mercy for My Throat?
I'm listening."

232
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,430
And this was not for the faint of heart.
This was not entry-level porn.

233
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,310
This was mascara running.

234
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,610
Like...

235
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,740
The kind of blowjobs where
they have to come up for air. Just...

236
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,710
She's like, "What the fuck is that?"

237
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm like, "That is a blowjob."

238
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,510
She's like, "Who does it like that?"
I go, "Champions, that's who.

239
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,040
That woman's there for the love
of the game, not the paycheck.

240
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:38,230
You've got to understand something,
LeeAnn.

241
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,610
All women are different. You say,
'Tomato,' she says, 'Toma...'"

242
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,740
She's like,
"They don't make regular porn?"

243
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,240
I go, "What's regular porn?"

244
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,580
She's like, "The stuff we do."
I go, "You mean a bloopers reel? No."

245
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,410
There's not a porn out there
where the woman's giving a blowjob,

246
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,040
stops and goes, "Are our sprinklers on?

247
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,500
Yeah, I hear that.
They're on, aren't they?"

248
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,470
She won't even fuck me if I'm sick.

249
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,470
If I'm getting sick, off the table.

250
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,140
I will definitely have sex with her
when she's sick.

251
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,190
I did it Tuesday.

252
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,110
I'm getting ready to fly to Cleveland.

253
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:28,570
I go, "Hey, we should bang one out,
put one in the books, you know?"

254
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,530
She's like, "I'm getting sick."
I was like, "I don't care."

255
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:37,200
She's like, "I don't wanna get you sick."
I was like, "We'll practice safe sex."

256
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,330
She's like, "You are gonna wear a condom?"
I was like, "No.

257
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,790
Doggy style, so you cough into the wall."

258
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,140
"You got a cold, woman, not AIDS.

259
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,720
Spin around, Doc Holliday,
let's hit this shit!"

260
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,440
There is no better feeling than a woman
coughing during sex. Am I right, guys?

261
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,770
Whoo!

262
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,860
When it first happens,
it catches you off guard.

263
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,610
You're like, "Whoa, bear down, cowgirl.

264
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,990
You're not getting bucked off this bronco.
Not with that grip strength.

265
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,410
Holy Chasing Amy Chinese Finger Cuffs!

266
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,886
Remind me to use that thing
when we've got to open a jar."

267
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,460
How great would it be...

268
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,630
How great...

269
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,050
How great would it be...

270
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,590
How great would it be
if our dicks got bigger when we coughed?

271
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,110
I'd be fucking my wife with a kitten
and a handful of pollen. Just...

272
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,150
"'I got a small dick."
So I bought a gun. Now...

273
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,400
Whoa. I would hold your applause
until you hear the joke.

274
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,240
You may not want to applaud
at the end.

275
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,860
No one's gonna like this joke.

276
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,120
If you're for guns, you're gonna hate it.

277
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,370
And if you're against guns,
you're gonna really fucking hate it.

278
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,040
I bought a gun 'cause...
I didn't know we even sold guns in LA.

279
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,040
I was driving down the street.
I saw a gun store.

280
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,920
I was like, "Shut the fuck up."

281
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:12,800
I flipped a bitch.
I walked in, I was like, "Hey.

282
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Can I buy a gun from you guys?"

283
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,260
They're behind the counter, like,
"That's exactly what we do."

284
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,970
They're like,
"What do you need a gun for, friend?"

285
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,850
I was like, "I don't know. Respect?"

286
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,011
"You're in the right place.
You need a Glock. Come on in."

287
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:32,230
Holy shit. I have never had more fun
with another man on a Monday...

288
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,240
than I did with this guy

289
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,000
when he walked me through
all the upgrades you could get on a Glock.

290
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,950
He says, "Gotta get rid of the scope.
The scope they give you sucks dick.

291
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,426
-You need a scope that glows in the dark."
-I was like, "Yeah,

292
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,080
I'm gonna be shooting a lot of shit
in the dark."

293
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,840
He's like,
"Want a flashlight on your gun?"

294
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,250
I was like, "Fuck, yeah,
I want a flashlight on my gun.

295
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,550
I want to know what I'm shooting.
What am I, a cop?"

296
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:53,630
Then he said...

297
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,550
Are we still cheering, buddy? Sorry.

298
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,850
Don't worry.
The boat swings back this way now.

299
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,350
I am not a responsible gun owner.
I'll tell you that right now.

300
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,230
My two favorite things to do with my gun
are drink with my gun...

301
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,400
and point it at people.

302
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,330
Dude, there is no better feeling
in the world

303
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,990
than coming home to your house,

304
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,460
2:00 in the morning, lights out,
kids asleep...

305
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,500
pouring yourself a whiskey...

306
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,210
grabbing your Glock...

307
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,760
taking your trousers off...

308
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,760
and running the perimeter of your house...

309
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,390
naked, loaded and loaded. Just...

310
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,150
Dog's walking next to you like,
"I wish a motherfucker would."

311
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,730
How great would it be if that's
when someone broke into your house?

312
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,020
They climb through the window,
and first thing they see,

313
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,570
whiskey, cock, Glock, dog.

314
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,780
"We've been waiting for you.

315
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,330
Tonight's gonna get a little weird.
I'm not gonna lie to you. Am I right?"

316
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:11,290
Here's my biggest problem.
My biggest problem I've had

317
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,920
is there's a gun
attached to my flashlight.

318
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,816
Whenever you need a flashlight, everyone's
like, "Quick, where's the flashlight?"

319
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,510
You're like, "...

320
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,850
I know where one is."

321
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,350
Now you're the dad in the thunderstorm.
"Is everyone in the living room?"

322
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,190
Camping with your family.
"Who wants to hear a scary story?"

323
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,080
Taking the trash out in the middle of
the night, just waving it down the alley.

324
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,750
Dude, I took the trash out one night,
right? Gun, unloaded.

325
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,380
I should have said that at the beginning.
I've never put bullets in my gun. Sorry.

326
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,420
It's a very different story.

327
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,720
I tried when I got it, but then it hurt
my thumb. So I was like, "Fuck it."

328
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,010
And then I lost the little sleeve thing
with the bullets in it.

329
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,720
I don't even know where that is.

330
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,930
I lost my gun one time.

331
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,940
Do you know how scary that is?

332
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,060
Walking into your living room like...

333
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:16,150
"Hey...

334
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,780
has anybody seen Dad's...

335
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,780
You know what? Never mind, never mind."

336
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,426
"What is it, Dad?"
I was like, "You'll know when you see it.

337
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,910
You'll be like,
'That's what Dad was looking for.'

338
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,200
Just get me. Don't tell Mom. Come get me.

339
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,500
And I'll be like, 'Okay, $100.'
If you find what I'm looking for, $100."

340
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,590
So I'm taking the trash out
one night, right?

341
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,960
Gun unloaded, flashlight on.
Very confident.

342
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,710
I drop off the trash,
I'm coming back into my house,

343
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,680
gun unloaded, very confident,
point it into my living room.

344
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,020
Unbeknownst to me, my wife had
let our bullmastiff out to take a shit.

345
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,730
Yeah, we have a 140-pound bullmastiff.
I did not know that.

346
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,190
I just heard a noise by the garage.

347
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,570
Swing my flashlight around to investigate.

348
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,910
Lights up my dog shitting which looks
a lot like a werewolf in transition.

349
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,080
It scared me.
I pulled the fucking trigger!

350
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,080
You should have seen the dog.
She was like, "Motherfucker!

351
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,630
Is there someone behind me?"

352
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,800
This dog sucks dick.

353
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,260
She does. Biggest mistake, man.

354
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,020
I bought a purebred bullmastiff.

355
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Purebred.

356
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,310
Pure... Well, purebred.

357
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,360
Champion bloodlines on the mom's side.
Champion bloodlines on the dad's side.

358
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,650
Purebred, top dollar.

359
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,820
Five knee surgeries.

360
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,320
Yeah. Only has four legs.

361
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Five...

362
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,700
Yeah. It doesn't have a jump shot,
can't hit a curve ball. No scholarship.

363
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,370
On the second knee surgery,
I said to the vet,

364
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,420
"What are we gonna do about this dog?"
He goes, "You want to just put her down?"

365
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,360
I was like, "No, this is my dog."

366
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,840
He goes, "There's gonna be
a lot more knee surgeries."

367
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,880
I go, "Why?"
And he goes, "You bought a purebred."

368
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:10,850
I was like, "They're the best."
He's like, "No, they're not."

369
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,696
He says, "Idiots like you want to know
what your dog's gonna look like.

370
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
So you buy a purebred.

371
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:19,100
But what you don't know is,
in order to keep that breed pure,

372
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,980
they've been breeding the same bloodlines
for centuries,

373
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,990
and now what's happened
is they've overbreeded those bloodlines.

374
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,820
And that is why you're getting dogs with
weak-ass constitutions and birth defects.

375
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,530
All an attempt to keep them pure."

376
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:37,080
I was literally in his office like,
"So you're telling me right now...

377
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,750
Hitler was totally wrong."

378
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,340
If Germany had won that war,

379
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,760
blonde chicks would be walking around
with hip dysplasia, just...

380
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,190
- Big tits, but just...
- "Da...

381
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:01,940
This is how I breathe when I sleep?"

382
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,480
We got a rescue dog.
Also, we got a rescue cat.

383
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:07,400
Big mistake.

384
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,160
The rescue dog, we got from East LA.

385
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,030
Apparently, some Mexican gangbangers

386
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,700
had spray-painted her
to look like a Raiders helmet.

387
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:20,920
And that's when we took over,

388
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,670
only to find out very quickly,
A, the dog doesn't speak English.

389
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,210
Didn't know that was a thing.

390
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,880
Yeah. And, B, hates Mexicans.

391
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,850
If you think
Trump has a distaste for them...

392
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,390
this dog fucking hates them. Just...

393
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,800
She sees a Mexican, she's like...

394
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,270
I'm on the other end of the leash like,
"Hey, what's up, homeboy?"

395
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,610
Like, "Yo, what's up
with your fucking dog, homes?"

396
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,490
"Well, she hates Mexicans."

397
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,780
"That's fucked up, homey."
"Well, you tell her. I can't."

398
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,670
"No, you got to beat that shit
out of her."

399
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,500
"I think that's
why she hates Mexicans."

400
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,470
Then we got a rescue cat.

401
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,930
If you're thinking about rescuing a cat,
don't.

402
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,350
Yeah, rescuing a cat's
like rescuing a hobo.

403
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,430
They've seen some shit in the streets.

404
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,850
It's not getting out of their DNA
anytime soon.

405
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,230
This cat's favorite thing to do
is catch rats outside,

406
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,230
bring them into our house

407
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,400
and let them go.

408
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,700
First day we got this cat,
I put in a cat-door so it could run away.

409
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
It didn't.

410
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,290
Apparently, it stuck its head
out of the cat-door in the afternoon

411
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,870
and was like,
"Hey, there's a new motherfucker in town.

412
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,840
And if you want to fight me,
meet me in my living room at 2:00 a.m.

413
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,010
Two neighborhood cats enter our house...

414
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,640
and fight our cat in our living room
in the middle of the fucking night.

415
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,730
My bitch-ass dogs are like,
"Lock the doors!"

416
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,150
Apurate, apurate, apurate, apurate!

417
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,360
All right, back to my guns. Now...

418
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,070
I go to pick up my guns. I got two guns.

419
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,410
I got a shotgun too,
but I broke it first day.

420
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,250
Yeah, I thought I got one that goes...

421
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:26,920
- But he sold me the one that went...
- "Hey."

422
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,550
So I go to pick up my guns,
and my arms dealer tells me, "Hey, man..."

423
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,090
He goes, "I can't give you your guns."

424
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,350
I said, "Why not?" He goes,
"None of your paperwork checks out."

425
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,326
I go, "What do you mean?" He goes,
"All the bills are in your wife's name.

426
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:47,440
You car's in your company's name.
I can't give you your guns."

427
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,440
I started laughing hysterically.

428
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,360
Because all I thought to myself was,
"Our system works?"

429
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,200
Like, how great is it
that our system works?

430
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,840
I looked at him, laughing hysterically.

431
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,910
I was like, "Dude, I feel safer
knowing I can't get a gun...

432
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,370
than if you gave me two guns.
I'm so happy to know our system works."

433
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,540
He looks at me dead serious and goes,
"You're getting your fucking guns."

434
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,260
I was like, "I don't feel so good
about this anymore, Kevin."

435
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:19,140
He's like, "We have a workaround."
This is what he did.

436
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:23,390
Called my wife on the phone, said, "Ma'am,
I want you to print out a blank lease.

437
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:28,230
Then fill it out, saying you rent a room
in your house to your husband.

438
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:33,110
Fax it into me.
I get it, I'll give him his guns."

439
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,030
My wife was cackling
on the other end of the phone.

440
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,900
"Sorry, we're at full occupancy, Kevin."

441
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,040
She sends it in. I get my guns.
I love my guns.

442
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,330
I do love my guns.
I'm the kind of idiot...

443
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,910
I don't know if you're like me,
where you see a gun in a movie,

444
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,540
and I call up my arms dealer immediately.
I was like, "Yo, Matrix.

445
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,170
Agent Smith. What gun is that?"

446
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,340
He's like, "Desert Eagle, 50 caliber."
I go, "Sign me up!"

447
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:04,100
He's like, "I can't do a 50 caliber
in California. I'll get you a 40 caliber.

448
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,350
I'll do a workaround in the office.
I'll get you what you need."

449
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,456
He's like, "You can get a long gun too.
What long gun do you want?"

450
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,060
I go, "Well, I need a shotgun."

451
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,120
He's like, "I just sold you a shotgun."

452
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:16,360
I go, "Yeah, you sold me
the circumcised one.

453
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,580
I want the uncircumcised one
where you can pull the hood back." Just...

454
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,700
He's like, "You don't want
another shotgun. You want an AR-15."

455
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:29,120
I was like, "Whoa, slow down, brother.

456
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,370
I might not be the right guy for an AR-15.

457
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,290
I lost my Glock for nine days."

458
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,920
All my wife heard was "AR-15"
and comes marching in the kitchen.

459
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,760
"Is that motherfucker
trying to upsell you on an AR-15?"

460
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,930
I'm like, "Bitch, men are talking."

461
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,576
She's like, "Did you tell him
you took your Glock in the shower?"

462
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
I'm like, "Woman!"

463
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,320
I go, "Kevin... I'm not gonna be
a part of the problem in this country.

464
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,240
I'm gonna be a part of the solution.

465
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,440
I'm not getting another one
of these killing machines,

466
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,860
putting it out into the population

467
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,530
and losing it for nine days
and some kid finding it.

468
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,620
All I want is my Desert Eagle 50 caliber.

469
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,040
And a...
shotgun."

470
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:17,630
My wife's next to me.
She goes, "That's the man I married."

471
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,010
Kevin's on the other end of the phone.
He goes, "Am I on speaker right now?"

472
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,350
I said, "No," and he goes,
"All right, cool.

473
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,310
I'll have the AR-15 waiting for you."

474
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,400
I said,
"Bro. I really don't want the gun."

475
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,810
He goes, "Give me ten seconds
and listen to me.

476
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,400
Bert, in the event of an apocalypse..."
I'm like, "I'm still listening."

477
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,740
He's like, "This is the best gun
to defend you and your family."

478
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,950
I couldn't even help myself.

479
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,370
I was like, "Can I get the one
with the bump stock on it?"

480
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,290
My wife heard me say that...

481
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,870
and canceled my fucking lease.

482
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,800
I had to show my kids my gun.

483
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,320
Yeah, I brought them into the bedroom.

484
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,850
I was like, "Dad's got guns.
Can't talk shit to me anymore."

485
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,970
These two window-licking ninnies...

486
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:15,190
they had two different reactions.

487
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,350
Georgia, my oldest, was just appalled.

488
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,400
She was like, "I can't believe you'd buy
guns with what's going on in our country.

489
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,820
At that moment,
that's when you go out and buy guns?"

490
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:27,200
And I was like, "Yeah.
And you go to your fucking room."

491
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Shh.

492
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,910
Get, get, get, get, get.

493
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,080
Ila's just staring at it.
She goes, "Can I touch it?"

494
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,550
I was like, "Yeah, pick it up."

495
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,010
She's like, "Is it loaded?"
I go, "I don't know.

496
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,180
Point it at the bed, pull the trigger,
find out."

497
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,180
She's like, "It's so heavy."

498
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,220
I go, "Put it in your other hand. It feels
like someone else is holding it.

499
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,810
There you go. Yeah.

500
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:55,430
Yeah. Yeah.

501
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,940
Hold it with both hands
and point it at the cat.

502
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,650
Watch. Turn the laser on.

503
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:04,530
It's like the cat wants to die.
He's like, 'Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!'"

504
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,370
I'm a bad parent.

505
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,790
Even when I try, I fail.

506
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,580
My kids went and saw Black Panther
with a bunch of friends.

507
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,000
All the parents stayed at home,
sent the kids to the movie theater.

508
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,710
They come back. We're all drunk.

509
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,420
They're so excited.
"It was the greatest movie ever."

510
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:28,680
All the parents were like,
"Tell us about it, tell us about it."

511
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,970
I got a little bit of a buzz...

512
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,810
and all I said was,

513
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,100
"Were there are
a lot of black people there?"

514
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,190
All the parents were like,
"Whoa, what the fuck?"

515
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,070
And I'm like, "What?
It's a big moment in black cinema.

516
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,360
Did you see black people?
Like... did you hear them?

517
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,610
Or what was the movie like? Was it loud?"

518
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,910
All the parents were like, "Bert..."
Even my wife's like, "Stop talking."

519
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,830
Luckily, my kids stepped up,
and they're like,

520
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,540
"Dad, we don't actually look
for that kind of thing.

521
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,380
So we couldn't give you an answer."

522
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,130
Everyone's like,
"Well, at least he raised good kids."

523
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,880
A few months later...

524
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,970
we're at Avengers: Infinity War.

525
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,680
Houselights drop, trailers start,
spread out the popcorn.

526
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,230
My youngest daughter, Ila,
is sitting next to me,

527
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,850
reaches over to my popcorn,

528
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,560
leans over to my ear and goes, "12."

529
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,830
I go, "12 what, Ila?"

530
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,990
She goes, "You know."

531
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,670
I go, "No, I don't know
what you're talking about."

532
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,630
She leans in closer and goes, "Wakanda."

533
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,800
I feel like I'm a better parent
when I'm not there.

534
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:59,140
Like, when something happens
for my family, if I'm gone,

535
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,810
it's so much better.
My daughters got their periods.

536
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:04,440
Ooh, that was a pause?

537
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,190
The guys on the top row are like, "I'm
gonna go get another beer real quick."

538
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,450
My daughters got their periods.
Georgia got hers first.

539
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,530
She's the oldest. That's how that works.

540
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,450
I wasn't there.

541
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,330
Thank God, 'cause I would have
fucked that up royally.

542
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,710
I'd have been like, "You go to the river
and do laundry for a week. You're dirty.

543
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,960
Go on, get.

544
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,750
Go on, get."

545
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,840
Georgia, just to paint the picture,
is a simple moron.

546
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,930
Like a very...

547
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,310
goodhearted, Christian moron.

548
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,980
Just doesn't know what she's saying.

549
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,690
We were playing...
We were playing Scattergories one time.

550
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,496
Where you roll the dice, letter comes up,
fill out all the categories.

551
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,770
Me, Georgia and Ila.

552
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,780
We roll the letter "N." I look at Ila.
First one is US states.

553
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,380
I go, "Ila, what did you put
for US states that start with 'N'?"

554
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,240
She goes, "I couldn't think of one."

555
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,280
I go, "You're in eighth grade.

556
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,306
You couldn't think of one state
that started with 'N'?"

557
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,500
She goes, "No. Could you?"
I go, "Yeah, Nevada."

558
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,290
She goes, "Never heard of it."

559
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:13,010
I go, "Georgia, what did you put?"
She goes, "New Hampshire." I was like...

560
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:14,680
"Ila, is that a state?

561
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,720
I thought that was a providence."

562
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,470
Next one, street names.

563
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,140
I go, "Ila, what'd you put
for street names that start with 'N'?"

564
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,180
She goes, "Nebraska." I'm like, "Bitch!

565
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,560
That's what I put."

566
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,530
I go, "Georgia, what did you put
for street names that start with 'N'?"

567
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,030
And she goes,
"Um, I think I did this wrong."

568
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,830
I go, "What did you put for street names
that start with the letter 'N,' Georgia?"

569
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,410
She goes, "I don't want to tell you guys.

570
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,290
I think...
I think I'm gonna keep it to myself."

571
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,000
I'm like, "Now you're definitely
fucking telling us."

572
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,090
She goes, "I wrote, 'Notorious B.I.G.'

573
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,430
Wasn't that his street name?"

574
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:07,520
I'm like, "You beautiful fucking idiot.
Yes, it was."

575
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,110
She got her period...

576
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,410
on a Saturday night,
in middle of the night.

577
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,570
Woke up Sunday morning, bleeding,
freaking out.

578
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,820
Crack of dawn.
I was on the road, thank God.

579
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,030
Walked into our bedroom.

580
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,580
Woke up my wife, five in the morning,
bleeding and crying.

581
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:30,000
Her exact words were, "Mommy,
I'm not ready to be a big girl today."

582
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,210
Aw.

583
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,130
It breaks your heart. It really does.

584
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,300
My wife is a fucking gangster.

585
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,760
I joke a lot about her.

586
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,760
She's a bad motherfucker.

587
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:43,680
Dude, she scooped her up,
took her out to the living room,

588
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,520
put her down on the couch,
put some towels down, I hope.

589
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,230
Went out, got doughnuts, came home,

590
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:53,980
started season one, episode one
of Downton Abbey.

591
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,280
And that became their show.

592
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,490
That was Georgia's entrance
into womanhood.

593
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,070
That's how they bonded.

594
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,280
I came home, I didn't even know
anything had happened.

595
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,580
I was drunk, obviously.

596
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,200
We had just put our new pool in.

597
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,620
So I go, and I grab Ila.
I take her outside.

598
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,920
I throw her in the pool.

599
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,920
I grabbed Georgia.
You already know it, don't you?

600
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,670
The second I grab her,
she goes, "Get your hands off me!"

601
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:22,760
I'm like, "Whoa.
You do not talk to your father like that."

602
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,430
Ila pops up out of the pool.
"Dad, we got a bleeder!"

603
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,570
Georgia starts crying immediately.
LeeAnn yells at me.

604
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,780
I end up in the pool with Ila,
drinking a double Tito's and soda.

605
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,080
Getting the full rundown.

606
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,000
Ila's like, "Dad,
I followed the tracks into Mom's room."

607
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,960
I go, "You followed tracks?"
She goes, "Like a hunter, Dad."

608
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,760
Looks at me dead in the face and goes,
"Hey, Dad, I promise you right now,

609
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,170
I'll never get my period."

610
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,180
I was like, "Really?"

611
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:07,100
She goes, "Yeah.
I'll always be your best little buddy."

612
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,430
Aw.

613
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,810
I know.
I almost started crying in the pool

614
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:14,150
because I was like, "How stupid is she?"

615
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,150
I'll tell you how stupid she is.
I'll tell you exactly how stupid she is.

616
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,320
If you spend too much time with her,
you start getting stupid.

617
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,490
Does that make sense?

618
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,620
We took a family trip this summer.

619
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,160
First morning,
we all sit down for breakfast.

620
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,830
Ila shows up five minutes late.

621
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:36,960
Sits at the table, looks at me and goes,
"Hey, big boy.

622
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:41,420
What did you think
about those dreams last night?"

623
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:52,180
Now we're all looking at each other going,
"She thinks we have the same dreams?"

624
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,610
She's 12. For 12 years...

625
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:01,320
she thought we all got the same dreams...

626
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,030
programmed every night.

627
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,070
That everyone got the same set.

628
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,080
Like it's must-see TV.

629
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,420
But then I'm sitting
across from her going,

630
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,580
"I had two dreams about this kid
last night.

631
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,170
What if she cracked the code?"

632
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,580
I lean across the table.

633
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,870
I go, "Hey, did you dream
that I was locked in a trunk?"

634
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,300
My wife goes,
"What the fuck are you doing?

635
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,550
We don't have the same dreams."

636
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:29,350
Ila kicks me under the table. She goes,
"I'll talk to you after breakfast."

637
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,570
That afternoon, we're going snorkeling,
right? We're out on the boat.

638
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,860
And I'm watching Ila look
off the side of the boat at the horizon.

639
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,020
It looks beautiful.

640
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:44,030
Great moment as a parent to say, "Hey,
baby girl, what are you thinking about?"

641
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,070
Your kid turns around.
Dream scenario, "Hey, Dad...

642
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,030
thanks."

643
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,290
I go, "Hey, baby girl,
what are you thinking about?"

644
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,080
She turns around and goes,
"We should get tattoos."

645
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,090
I go, "We're not getting tattoos."
She goes, "No, Dad, think about it.

646
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,430
If we all got the same one,
we'd never regret it."

647
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,760
I go, "You're 12, Ila.
What tattoo would you want?"

648
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:13,100
She goes, "What's it called
when you cover your arm?"

649
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,230
I go, "You want a fucking sleeve?

650
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,980
You're gonna be the only eighth grader
walking into homeroom

651
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,860
like it's a jujitsu tournament.

652
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:25,530
What do you want
sleeved on your arm, Ila?"

653
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,860
She goes, "A wolf.

654
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,780
Yeah, Dad. His head would start up here,
his body would come by my elbow,

655
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:34,080
and his tail
would come down to my fingertip.

656
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,710
That way you'd know if I was happy
'cause I'd be wagging my finger."

657
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,840
I'm like, "Turn this boat around.
We're getting tattoos."

658
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,800
There was a period of time...

659
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,800
where LeeAnn and I
would take Ila's tests from school outside

660
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,430
and read her answers aloud
to each other...

661
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,440
in astonishment
at the human being we had created.

662
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,320
She took a test in proverbs one time.
Very simple.

663
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,150
Proverbs. They gave her the first part,
she had to fill out the second part.

664
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,490
Very simple.
"The grass is always greener..."

665
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,370
On the other side.

666
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,450
"When you water it," is what she put.

667
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,710
"Don't bite the hand..."

668
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,960
That feeds you.

669
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
"That's brown."

670
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,630
"Children should be seen and not..."

671
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,260
- Heard.
- "...touched."

672
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,390
This is the child...

673
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:43,270
This is the child in chest-deep water in
the pool, staring me in the eyes, going,

674
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,270
"I'll never get my period, I promise."

675
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,820
Then a year and a half later,
on a Friday...

676
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,040
Now, it's important
I tell you it's a Friday

677
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:55,950
'cause, on Fridays, LeeAnn, my wife,
goes to therapy and her chiropractor,

678
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:58,290
so she is incommunicado all day.

679
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,040
I'm at home, phone rings.
It's a school nurse.

680
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:05,380
She goes, "I have Ila in the office.
Is there a parent at home?"

681
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:06,710
I was like, "I'll do."

682
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,510
Gives the phone to Ila.

683
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:13,260
Her first words,
"I tried to stop it, Dad."

684
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,100
I go, "Stop what?"

685
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,720
She goes, "I got my period."

686
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,730
I'm like, "Bitch, you promised."

687
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:27,570
I'm like, "You called the wrong number,
dickhead. Call your mom."

688
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,320
She's like, "Dad, I need you right now."

689
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,280
Immediately, as a parent, I'm melting down

690
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,070
because I'm like, "She's freaking out
at school. She's by herself.

691
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,410
She's going through what Georgia
went through.

692
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:38,740
This isn't my skill set."

693
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,580
But I got this.
I go, "Okay, baby. All right. Okay.

694
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,790
How'd you get it?"

695
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,380
She was like,
"Dad, I was playing kickball."

696
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,220
Immediately, I'm like, "Poor kid,
probably thought she blew out her pussy."

697
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,720
Just...

698
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,100
"Shit!

699
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,930
I'm out, Coach. I'm out.

700
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,020
Yeah.

701
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,560
I tore my twat.

702
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,020
It's bad.

703
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,440
I blew out my cooch, Coach.
I'm gonna have to sit this one out.

704
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,110
Pinch runner! Pinch runner!"

705
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,530
Now I'm spiraling.

706
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,120
I'm like, "What do you need from me?
New pants, new panties, new socks?

707
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,450
Did it get in your socks?

708
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:27,040
A bucket, some towels, garlic.
We gotta keep vampires away from you."

709
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,840
She's like, "Dad, I'm fine.
Mom gave me a go-bag."

710
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,050
I go, "Then what are you calling me for?"

711
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,600
She goes, "I need you to go to the store
and get supplies."

712
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,430
I'm like, "How bad is this period?"

713
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:45,060
She's like, "No, Dad. I'm throwing myself
a period party tonight."

714
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,310
I'm like, "I'm sorry,
what did you just say?"

715
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,160
She's like,
"All the girls are doing it, Dad.

716
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,110
I need you to go to the store
and get supplies.

717
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,740
Get a red velvet cake." I'm like...

718
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,340
I go, "Baby, I don't think
I can eat a red velvet cake...

719
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,210
knowing what it symbolizes."

720
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,090
She's like, "Dad, you need
a red velvet cake for a period party

721
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,690
'cause you put the name of your period
on the cake." I'm like...

722
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,810
"Who names their period?"

723
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:27,730
She's like, "Georgia named hers after
the girl from Progressive auto insurance."

724
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,480
She's like, "Dad, please.
I need you right now.

725
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:35,930
I have ten people coming tonight."

726
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,610
I go, "We have ten little girls
coming to the house?"

727
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,120
She goes, "No, eight girls, two boys."

728
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm like,
"Who invites boys to a period party?"

729
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,580
And I hear her sinister little giggle
on the phone,

730
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,750
and she goes, "Dad, that's the fun of it.

731
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,920
We don't tell them why they're there."

732
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,840
Now I'm like, "Fuck it, I'm in."

733
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:04,640
I have never had more fun at a party
in my entire life.

734
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,230
Planning, hosting and attending
a period party.

735
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:11,150
I dressed all in red,
like it was Chinese New Year's.

736
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,650
Drinking pinot noir.
I made pasta with chunky marinara sauce.

737
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,120
And I giggled the whole night
with all these little girls

738
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,750
at these two boys, Max and Carter,
faces covered in red cake.

739
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:30,960
Like it's their honeymoon, and they're
like, "Fuck it, I'll eat it anyway."

740
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:36,170
The whole party,
these two boys are looking at the cake,

741
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,960
going, "Who the hell's Jason?"

742
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,220
My daughter, Ila Kreischer...

743
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,720
named her period Jason...

744
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:47,100
because she got it on Friday the 13th.

745
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:59,610
I pray this child doesn't find marijuana.

746
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:05,330
My dad just found marijuana.

747
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,200
Seventy years old.

748
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,500
Started eating it every night.
Twenty milligrams, my mom says.

749
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,420
Dad's eating...
That's what I said, like, "That's a lot."

750
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,000
I go, "Are there any side effects?"

751
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,300
She goes, "Other than the fact
that he calls me 'bro' a lot, no."

752
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,630
We go down to Tampa,
spend some time with my parents.

753
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,050
We're out on their dock.
My whole family. My dad, my mom.

754
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,220
You can tell when my dad's weed kicks in

755
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,520
'cause he starts humming
Jimmy Buffett songs.

756
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:34,480
All of a sudden, he just pops up,
turns around to us, and he goes,

757
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,690
"Who wants to talk
to an owl tonight?"

758
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,150
I look at my mom. I go,
"How much weed is Harry Potter eating?"

759
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,870
My mom's like, "No, he talks to an owl
every night. Show him, Albert."

760
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,950
My dad just gets on the edge of the dock
and goes...

761
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,830
My idiot kids were like,
"Papa, should we hoot too?"

762
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:56,420
He's like, "Yeah, come on, girls,
we'll all hoot. Here we go!"

763
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,960
Now the three of them
are on the edge of the dock,

764
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,300
like three Crips, letting them know
cops were in the neighborhood.

765
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,310
Five minutes goes by. Five minutes!

766
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:11,730
We don't hear a sound.

767
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,140
I look at my dad. I go,
"Dad, maybe we should sit down.

768
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:16,150
I don't think your owl's out tonight."

769
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,610
He's like, "Yeah, that's crazy.
He's always out.

770
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,110
Don't worry.
We'll try again tomorrow, girls."

771
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,400
Pour a glass of wine.

772
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,410
Thirty seconds later, clear as a bell,
all of us hear...

773
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,290
I get chill bumps.

774
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:36,750
I look at my dad,
and I go, "Dad, it's your owl."

775
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,880
He's like, "I told you, bro."

776
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:43,470
He's like, "I'll get him going.

777
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,630
And once I get him going,
we can all talk to him, all right?"

778
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,100
And right on top of it, we hear...

779
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,126
My oldest daughter goes, "Dad..."
I go, "Shut the fuck up.

780
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,650
We're talking to an owl."

781
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:06,990
She goes, "Dad..."
I go, "Wait your turn, bitch. I'm next."

782
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:11,200
She goes, "Dad, look across the lake
at the old man on his dock!"

783
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,750
Sure as shit, there's another drunk,
blind, old white man, just...

784
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,590
These two are like Ric Flair in a cave.
Just...

785
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,600
I'm scared of marijuana.

786
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,230
Like, healthily scared of marijuana.

787
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:44,400
'Cause I've had those bad times
where you get way too high,

788
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,070
and you think you're gonna die.

789
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:49,950
Your face gets cold.
Your heart starts racing.

790
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:52,200
You can feel sawdust
going down your throat.

791
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:56,870
Dude, highest I've ever been,
highest I've ever been, traffic school.

792
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:00,330
Yeah. One hit of a blunt.

793
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,130
I took one hit. That's it.

794
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,840
Black guy, sitting outside traffic school,
smoking a blunt, nods me over.

795
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,300
I'm thinking,
"I think it's racist if I say no."

796
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:12,680
I take one hit of his blunt,
I'm higher than I've ever been.

797
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,890
Now, for those of you
who don't know much about marijuana,

798
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,850
let me make this very clear.
A blunt is different than a joint, okay?

799
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,810
A joint is like a blowjob at camp.

800
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,780
Fun, light.

801
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,030
"Hey, I'll see you next year.
Send you a postcard." "All right!"

802
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,320
A blunt is like a blowjob in prison.

803
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,540
You're like, "Wow, this is a lot bigger
than I thought it would be.

804
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,210
It's brown, and it hurts my throat."

805
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:46,300
One hit off this blunt, one hit,

806
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,920
and I'm so high, panic sets in.

807
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:51,510
I was so scared,
I walked into traffic school

808
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,720
holding onto the black guy's shirt like...

809
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,850
We walk in, he sits down.
Middle row, second seat.

810
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,690
I sit directly in front of him.
Middle row, front seat.

811
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:06,520
We smell like two of Snoop Dogg's fingers.

812
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:12,990
Our teacher walks in,
has a completely atrophied right arm.

813
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:16,080
Immediately, I'm thinking,
"I wish I had known about that...

814
00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:19,200
before I got this high."

815
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,080
Now I'm staring at it.
I can't even help it.

816
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,620
I'm just tracking it, like...

817
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,340
He sees me looking at it and goes,
"All right, let's get this off the table.

818
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,630
Who notices something different about me?"

819
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:34,990
He didn't even finish his sentence
before my hand was in the air.

820
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,050
"Hey, right here."

821
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:41,350
As soon as it goes up, I realize I'm
the only one with their hand in the air,

822
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:45,150
and everyone else is looking at me
like, "You're gonna say it?"

823
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,336
And now I'm drawing a blank,
going, "What's it called?"

824
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,940
And he's like, "Well, what is it?"
I'm like, "...

825
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,450
I'm stalling so long that the black guy
taps me on the back and goes,

826
00:48:57,530 --> 00:48:59,660
"Psst, it's his arm."

827
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:06,330
And that is when marijuana
performed a miracle on me.

828
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,090
Marijuana said, "Bert, start talking.
We'll fill in the words."

829
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,510
I was like,
"I kind of want to know them first."

830
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,600
Marijuana was like,
"That's not how it works, big guy.

831
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,430
I'm gonna toss them into your mouth,

832
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,680
and you hit them out of the park
with your tongue."

833
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,190
So I said to this guy...
Highest I've ever been in my life,

834
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:29,480
8:15 in the morning in Burbank
in a middle school.

835
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:36,860
"I don't know
if I'm the only one that sees this...

836
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:43,250
but from where I'm sitting...

837
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,620
from my perspective...

838
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,010
it seems to me that one of your arms...

839
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,380
is fucking humongous."

840
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,810
This guy laughed so hard
his baby arm goes rodeo on him.

841
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,400
The black guy's dying laughing, and he
goes, "How do you think that happened?"

842
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,150
The black guy goes, "Hammer curls."

843
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:15,450
I'm trying to cut back on weed.
You're not supposed

844
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:17,110
to smoke weed around your...

845
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,950
- Do you smoke weed, sir?
- Yes.

846
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:28,620
That was...

847
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,330
I want to hear this guy fuck.

848
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,880
"Soft.

849
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,590
Suck tits.

850
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:36,260
Yes.

851
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,800
Happening."

852
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,510
God, I love that fucking answer.

853
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:46,060
We're good.

854
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,770
I can't smoke it around my kids.
Says my wife.

855
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,780
I had to watch my girls for nine days
by myself.

856
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,490
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

857
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,910
You ever watch your kids by yourself
for an extended period of time...

858
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,790
and then, two days in,
you start really clearly seeing

859
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:08,710
both sides of the abortion debate?
You're like, "Well..."

860
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:13,040
"I think you should be able to kill them
up to ninth grade.

861
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,510
Put them in the tub."

862
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:20,776
My wife sat the whole family down
at the kitchen table.

863
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,100
She goes, "All right, I'm going to Vietnam
for nine days, okay,

864
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,230
with my best friend, Sandy."
The girls start unraveling immediately.

865
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:30,440
Georgia's like, "Who are we staying with?"

866
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:34,610
My wife's like, "Dad."
They're like, "Who's watching us?"

867
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:35,940
My wife's like, "Dad."

868
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,780
They're like, "Who's watching Dad?"

869
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,490
My wife's like,
"Listen, I've made a very detailed list.

870
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:46,450
If your father follows this list to a T,
it'll be like I never left."

871
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:48,960
Georgia goes,
"He won't last 24 hours, Mom."

872
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,130
Boy, I should have taken the under
on that.

873
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,000
This list was so aggressive.

874
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:57,670
"Wake up, 5:45 a.m."

875
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,840
I'm like, "What crops are we harvesting?"

876
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,140
"Make the girls breakfast. Georgia likes
avocado toast. Ila likes bone broth."

877
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,850
I'm like, "Cool.

878
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,520
I'm living with Gwyneth Paltrow
and a cage fighter."

879
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,190
"Breakfast should be over by 6:00 a.m.

880
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,450
Send the girls to their room
to get dressed.

881
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,320
Check on Ila, 6:05.
She'll be asleep in her closet.

882
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,540
6:15, tell Ila she has to start shitting.

883
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,830
6:45, tell Ila to stop shitting.

884
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,760
6:50, out the door.
Drop off the girls, seven o'clock."

885
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,180
The first day, I woke up at 7:15.

886
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,550
Just in the weeds.

887
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,196
You know, when all the pleasantries
of parenting are out the door.

888
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:50,730
You're like, "Get the fuck out of bed!
Get the fuck out of bed!

889
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:52,690
Welcome to Thunderdome, bitches!"

890
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,080
They're like, "What's for breakfast?"

891
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:58,230
I'm like, "We're intermittent fasting
today, ladies. Let's go!

892
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,190
Make your own lunch boxes.
I'm making coffee.

893
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,650
We got to do this shit."

894
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,370
They're like, "Maybe we shouldn't
even go to school, we're so late."

895
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,700
I'm like, "You're not staying with me.
Get the fuck out the door."

896
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:15,120
They make their own lunch boxes.

897
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:18,460
Get them out the door so late.

898
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,550
You ever take your kids to school so late
there's no traffic?

899
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,430
Halfway there, you're like, "Fuck it.
Who wants to go to a water park?"

900
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:28,550
They make their own lunch boxes.

901
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,430
Drop them off.

902
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:32,730
Come home, take a Xanax,
sleep the day away.

903
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,980
Yeah, 'cause I'm a housewife.

904
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:43,740
Wake up, pick them up from school.
Take them out to dinner that night.

905
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:46,660
And at dinner that night,
into my second glass of wine...

906
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,950
realize I'm the only one that can drive.

907
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,580
Georgia sees this realization on my face
and goes,

908
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,870
"Hey, big boy...

909
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,710
how you think you're doing
on your first day?"

910
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,380
I'm like,
"I think we've had some hiccups, but...

911
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,970
all in all, I would say today's a victory.
What do you think, George?"

912
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,010
She goes, "Really?"

913
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:17,600
She goes, "Why don't you ask your youngest
daughter what she had for lunch today?"

914
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,400
I look at Ila.

915
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,190
And I go, "Hey, Ila,
what did you have for lunch today?"

916
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,610
She just looks at me and goes,
"A bag of rice."

917
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:39,000
I go, "And?"
And she goes, "A bag of rice."

918
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:44,630
Georgia's like, "Dad, she packed a lunch
like she was working on the railroads.

919
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,220
She didn't even bring a fork, Dad."
I go, "You didn't bring a fork?

920
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,310
Baby, didn't you feel
like your lunch was missing something?"

921
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,890
She goes, "Yeah. Soy sauce."

922
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:01,150
This idiot grabbed a microwaveable
Uncle Ben's bag of rice...

923
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,780
threw it in the microwave
for two extra minutes

924
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,400
so it would be hot at lunch.

925
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,370
Threw it in her backpack. No lunch box.

926
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,830
It exploded in her backpack.

927
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:25,550
She ate it out of her backpack
with her hand like a fucking orangutan.

928
00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:37,890
"My mom's in 'Nam."

929
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:47,900
We Uber home that night.

930
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,820
Get home, check my list.

931
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:56,290
"Girls should be showered and in bed
by 7:30."

932
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,410
It is ten o'clock.

933
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,250
I am wasted.

934
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:03,080
And they're drinking Diet Cokes.

935
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:04,840
Now I start unraveling.

936
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,840
I'm like, "Goddamn it, girls,
we're running late.

937
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:09,170
Go in the bathroom,
take a couple of whore's baths

938
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,260
and get in bed."

939
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,010
Georgia goes, "What did you just say?"

940
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,640
"A whore's bath, Georgia.

941
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,350
Take a whore's bath and get in bed."

942
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,810
"I don't even know what that is, Dad."

943
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,110
I go, "Over to the sink.
Pits and pussies, let's go."

944
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,780
"What did you say?"

945
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,040
"Over to the sink.
Pits and pussies, ladies. Let's go!"

946
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,160
Ila's standing next to Georgia. She goes,
"Dad, how do you get rid of ringworm?"

947
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,830
I'm like, "Motherfucker!

948
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:47,250
How did you get ringworm in one day?

949
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,590
Georgia, stay away
from dirt-dirt over there."

950
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,550
She got fucking ringworm.

951
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,340
"Don't touch anyone with that arm.
You are highly contagious."

952
00:56:54,430 --> 00:56:58,430
She hears that, takes her arm
and rushes me like I hit her with a pitch.

953
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:00,350
"Now you've got ringworm!"

954
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,810
I go, "You put it on my face, asshole!"

955
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,520
Georgia's making her way
out of the living room, real coy,

956
00:57:07,610 --> 00:57:10,440
and I go,
"No. Blood in, blood out, motherfucker.

957
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,860
Get her, Ila."

958
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:14,780
We grab Georgia, hold her down,
give her ringworm.

959
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,330
She's crying. We're laughing.
Send them to bed, no bath.

960
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,960
That's the best part of the day
right there.

961
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,250
Kids in bed. I am done.

962
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:28,630
Yeah.

963
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,170
Pour myself a drink. Get in my recliner.

964
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,880
Whiskey, cock, Glock, dog.

965
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:39,140
Turn on Dr. Pimple Popper.

966
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,430
Yeah.

967
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,690
Phone rings. LeeAnn.

968
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:46,810
Hard pass.

969
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,730
I am not defending
this shit-show of a day...

970
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,716
this drunk. I am drunk.
You're not allowed to be drunk.

971
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,070
That's the first thing on the list.
"Dad can't use drugs or alcohol

972
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,120
for nine days." For nine days!

973
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,660
She wants me to go to sleep
every night like a fucking Mormon. Just...

974
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,870
"Well, that was a great day.

975
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,210
That's it for me.

976
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:15,420
Looks like I'm done thinking."

977
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:25,480
Nine days with these kids, and she
wants me to raw dog it like a settler?

978
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,770
Phone rings again. LeeAnn. Hard pass.

979
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:30,940
Home phone rings.

980
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,480
I go, "What is this, 1982?
Who's answering that?"

981
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,320
Stops ringing.

982
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,200
Kill my drink. Make another drink.

983
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,620
Start to fade away.

984
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,926
You know that feeling
where your brain starts going crazy

985
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,660
like, "Okay, here we go."

986
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,120
I hear the girls' door open.
I'm like, "Shit."

987
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,460
Ila comes out over my shoulder,
and she goes, "Hey, big boy.

988
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,670
Think you could use a little company?"

989
00:58:57,630 --> 00:58:58,630
Nope.

990
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,430
I go, "Go back in your room."

991
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,100
She goes, "I can't sleep.

992
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,180
I thought I'd hang out and watch TV
with you."

993
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,230
I go, "Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

994
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,020
Just 'cause Mom's not here
doesn't mean there's no rules."

995
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,940
She goes, "But I can't sleep."
I go, "You haven't even tried to sleep."

996
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,530
She goes, "No, I did try. I can't sleep.
Georgia's on the phone with Mom."

997
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:17,610
I'm like...

998
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,450
"What did you just say?"

999
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:25,090
She goes, "Georgia's on the phone
with Mom. Is that a bad thing?"

1000
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:27,040
I go, "Is that a bad thing?

1001
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:31,250
I don't know. Did we just hold her down
and give her fucking ringworm?

1002
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,810
Let me explain it to you this way, idiot.

1003
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,090
Right now the snitch is talking
to the bitch, and we are fucked!"

1004
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:44,140
Georgia comes marching out of her bedroom,
phone in hand.

1005
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,680
"No, Mom. 'Pits and pussies.'
That's what he said.

1006
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,690
Hold on, he's drinking. Here you go, Dad."

1007
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,570
I grab the phone, put it to my ear.

1008
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:57,900
All I hear is, "A bag of fucking rice?"

1009
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:00,610
Cleveland!

1010
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,450
Thank you!

1011
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:06,450
Thank you!

1012
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:13,000
You will never know how much I appreciate
every single one of you here tonight.

1013
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,130
Thank you for pacing yourself,
drinking today.

1014
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:23,260
Thank you for showing up late
for work tomorrow.

1015
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:25,510
Thank you, Cleveland,

1016
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:28,390
for one of the greatest shows
I've ever had in my life.

1017
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:33,230
Thank you.

1018
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:36,020
Thank you! Thank you!

1019
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:38,000
I'd die laughing
if I heard back, "Me! Me!"

1020
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,090
You jerk.

1021
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,500
You heard it.

1022
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:42,760
I did hear a "hoo."

1023
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:48,680
Do you hear a person laughing
on the dock over there?

1024
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,890
You jerk. That was an owl, you jerk.
