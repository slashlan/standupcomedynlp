Yes! That's right!

155
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,042
[cheers and applause]

156
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,590
That's how I will sing
the national anthem.

157
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,550
And then I will be deported.

158
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:48,843
[chuckles]

159
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:49,927
Oh, my God.

160
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,224
Speaking of being deported,
Trump is president, and...

161
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,851
Yeah, I know. I still can't believe it.

162
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,145
Every time I see him talking,

163
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:03,024
I'm just waiting for him to go,
"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!"

164
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:07,278
You'd be like, "Oh, my God,
it's been the longest sketch ever.

165
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,572
Wow!"

166
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:13,994
Oh, my God. I gotta tell you,
I know some of you might've voted for him.

167
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,246
I know that some immigrants
actually voted for Trump

168
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,333
because they wanted fewer taxes,
but they ended up with fewer relatives.

169
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,586
Yeah. That happens.

170
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,967
I'll be honest.
When the whole Muslim ban thing...

171
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,610
people were saying Muslim ban...
they asked me, "Are you afraid?"

172
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,718
I go, "I'm not afraid personally
of the Muslim ban."

173
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,683
Because the honest truth is
I'm really not that religious.

174
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:39,436
I was born in Iran,
but I'm not really religious.

175
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,064
I'm not really Muslim.
I'm more like Muslim-ish.

176
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,817
You know? This is how Muslim I am:

177
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,320
I could play a Muslim in a movie.
You'd go see it, you'd believe it.

178
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,865
You'd go to a movie,
you'd see me on the screen.

179
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,324
<i>"Allahu Akbar!"</i>

180
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,952
"Oh, he's good. Look at that. Wow."

181
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,371
[ululating]

182
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,331
"He speaks the language. Wow.

183
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,000
He's...

184
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,879
He's fluent in Muslim-ish.

185
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,006
Wow."

186
00:09:08,757 --> 00:09:10,842
But the honest truth is
I'm not that religious.

187
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,428
If I were really Muslim,
I would have to fast during Ramadan.

188
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,572
I don't fast during Ramadan.

189
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,973
I couldn't drink alcohol.
I drink alcohol.

190
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,518
I would have to pray five times a day.
I don't pray.

191
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,480
The only time I pray
is if I'm almost in an accident.

192
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,608
And then I just go, "Oh, Jesus!"

193
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,029
Yeah.  Yeah.

194
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,114
Yeah.

195
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,117
It's the wrong God! It's the wrong God!

196
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,788
I just say, "Oh, Jesus,"
because it's faster.

197
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,872
"Oh, Jesus!"

198
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,124
"Oh, Muhammad!" Takes too long.

199
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,417
Takes too long.

200
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,211
Takes too long.

201
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,379
Yeah.

202
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,590
If you go, "Oh, Muhammad,"

203
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,259
you're gonna get in the accident,
you'll be in the ambulance,

204
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,113
on your way to the hospital...
"I should've gone with Jesus."

205
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,556
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying.

206
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,726
I'm just saying.

207
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,855
So, I wasn't too worried
about the Muslim ban personally,

208
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,650
but my cousin Majid...
that guy is screwed, okay?

209
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,986
He's a real Muslim.
He prays five times a day,

210
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,323
fasts during Ramadan.
Like, he's gotta go, you know.

211
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,408
No, I didn't say it, Trump said it.
He's gotta go.

212
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,869
I love him, he's a nice guy,
but he's gotta go.

213
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,705
I'm just saying,
if the FBI shows up at my house

214
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,917
and goes, "Are there any Muslims?"
I'd be like, "Yeah. Majid."

215
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,005
I'm not gonna lie to the FBI.

216
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,301
Actually, guys, it was kind of sad,

217
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,221
because, like I said, I'm Iranian
and my wife is Indian,

218
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,265
so our kids are all colored up, and...

219
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,561
it was very sad. When Trump won,
my little six-year-old girl came up to me.

220
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,647
She was scared. She goes,
"Daddy, am I gonna get deported?"

221
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,233
Yeah. And I said, "No, baby,
you're not gonna get deported.

222
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,777
You were born here.
You're not gonna be deported.

223
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,737
But Cousin Majid's gotta go.

224
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,909
You might want to say goodbye."

225
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,291
You know, as a comedian, it's been
really hard to keep up with Trump,

226
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,960
because he says so much crazy shit
all the time.

227
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,964
It's been really hard. I swear to God.
Listen, I don't know if you remember...

228
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,133
a little while ago,
he was doing a press conference,

229
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,052
and I actually was watching.
I felt sorry for him,

230
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:20,263
he was doing the press conference,
for no reason,

231
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,473
he decided to volunteer some information.

232
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,394
Nobody asked him. He just decided,
"By the way, I just want everyone to know

233
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:32,066
that I won this election
with the most Electoral College votes

234
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,651
since Ronald Reagan."

235
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,361
And the reporter goes, "Sir, actually,

236
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,864
Barack Obama had more
Electoral College votes than you did."

237
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,032
He goes, "Okay, fine.

238
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,535
But I won with the most
Electoral College votes for a Republican

239
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,703
since Ronald Reagan."

240
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,788
And the reporter goes,
"Sir! Actually...

241
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,918
George Bush Sr. had more
Electoral College votes than you did."

242
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,838
He goes, "Fine, I won with the most
Electoral College votes for a Republican

243
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,882
in <i>this</i> election.
Can we agree to that?"

244
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,430
I wish that's what he would've said.

245
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:05,475
What he actually said was,
"Well, someone told me."

246
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,394
Who told you?

247
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,231
Some guy in the bathroom?
What the hell?

248
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,400
Was he in the bathroom?
"Hey, by the way,

249
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,644
you won with the most
Electoral College votes since..."

250
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,405
"Can I go tell the world?
I want to go tell them that."

251
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,826
Guys, I was watching that.
I felt sorry for him,

252
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,495
because I realized he's not qualified

253
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,514
to be the President
of the United States of America.

254
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,538
He just is not.

255
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,166
He is not.

256
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:38,132
And listen, let me tell you something.
Listen.

257
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:41,678
That's not to poo-poo on him, okay?
None of us are qualified...

258
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,764
No, this is the Kennedy Center.
Two of you are qualified.

259
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,767
But most people are not qualified

260
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,436
to be the President of the United States.

261
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,122
This is the most important job
in the world.

262
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,483
It's not the managerial position
at Carl's Jr., okay?

263
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,070
And it's the only job where people go,
"You know what? I want an outsider.

264
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,593
I want someone who's never done this

265
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,449
to go in there and give it a shot,
see what happens."

266
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:07,245
You don't hear anyone ever be like,
"I want a surgeon who's an outsider.

267
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,998
Someone who's never operated before.

268
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,876
Someone who will take my left eye
and put it in my right eye."

269
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,922
That's who we have as president right now.

270
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,807
Just not qualified.

271
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,102
I have a feeling when he had
his first intelligence briefing,

272
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:35,148
I can imagine him saying something like,
"Wow! There's so many countries!"

273
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,234
Couldn't you imagine that?

274
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,655
He's like, "Wow. Malta's a country?
Really? I thought that was an ice cream.

275
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,909
You mean Madagascar
is not an animation movie? What?!"

276
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,288
The only place he seems to know
is Mar-a-Lago.

277
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,332
Every week, Mar-a-Lago, Mar-a-Lago.

278
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,752
How much time is he gonna go...
And he keeps sending Jared Kushner,

279
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,254
his son-in-law,
to the most dangerous places in the world.

280
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,132
I think he's trying to get rid
of his son-in-law.

281
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:03,926
I swear to God.

282
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,641
Every week: "You go to Iraq.
I'm going to Mar-a-Lago. You go to...

283
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,812
Yeah, you don't need a vest.
No bulletproof vest. Go over there.

284
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,397
I'm gonna go to Mar-a-Lago."

285
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,860
It's a mess, and we've seen it,
and part of it is...

286
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:24,947
Listen, guys, it's like, uh...
we saw it with the travel ban.

287
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,617
That was so poorly done.
I gotta admit, as an Iranian-American,

288
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,410
I was offended by the travel ban,

289
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,038
because the fact is,
they were trying to sell it to America,

290
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,416
saying that it was for America's safety,
to keep terrorists out of the country.

291
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,710
And none of the countries
on the travel ban

292
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,962
had committed an act of terror in America.

293
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:42,757
Right?

294
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:52,392
Yeah, and then they had the balls
to introduce Travel Ban 2.0.

295
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,645
Like it's an iPhone update. They just...

296
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,941
I was so upset.
I was watching TV,

297
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,652
and Kellyanne Conway was on TV,
and she was trying...

298
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,612
- [booing]
- No, listen. No, of course.

299
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,907
Yeah. Yeah.
How do you really feel about her?

300
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,411
Listen, I was watching her on TV,

301
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:14,497
and she goes, "It's just a little bit
of an inconvenience at the airports.

302
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,790
It's not a big deal.

303
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,709
After September 11th, when there was
further scrutiny at the airports,

304
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,629
I did not mind being scrutinized,
because it was for my own safety."

305
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,400
I wanted to shake her and go,
"It's not just a little inconvenience."

306
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,664
Because I heard the real stories.
As an Iranian-American,

307
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:30,138
I was getting the real stories.
There was families being torn apart,

308
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,807
people that needed medical attention
that couldn't get it,

309
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,976
weddings being canceled,
all kinds of stuff.

310
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,396
And I got so upset, I went down
to Los Angeles International, LAX,

311
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,191
and I protested.
I went down to the protest. Yeah! Yeah!

312
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,359
Yeah!

313
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,203
I gotta tell you guys,
if you haven't protested, you should.

314
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,913
It's so much fun.

315
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,666
No, find any protest,
you just go down and you march.

316
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,002
It's so much... I swear to God.
He's been president...

317
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,379
every weekend, I find a protest.
It's great.

318
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:07,675
No, you just go down there,
they give you cookies. It's delicious.

319
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,928
And it's good exercise.
I've been getting really good exercise.

320
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,474
People go, "You been doing Pilates?"
I go, "No, I've been doing Trump-ates.

321
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,561
Just do Trump-ates, Trump-ates,
Trump-ates."

322
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,024
Guys, I was excited.
I went down to LAX, and I was marching.

323
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,027
We were all marching,
some guy comes up and goes,

324
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,320
"Bro, this is the most amazing thing
in the world.

325
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:31,032
This is the most diversity I've ever seen
in Los Angeles."

326
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:34,994
And I go, "Bro, that's because
we are at the airport.

327
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,708
People are literally flying in
from around the world as we speak."

328
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,239
He's like, "But there's Asians."

329
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,546
I go, "That's because AirAsia
just landed!

330
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,551
You think everybody shows up at a protest
with luggage? What the hell?"

331
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,764
There was some poor Korean guy.
He was just trying to cross the street.

332
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,475
This guy: "Excuse me, excuse me.
Yeah, excuse me.

333
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,020
Yeah, I know.
Trump must go, but so must I!

334
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,563
I have to...

335
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,985
I go to Disneyland, please. Excuse me."

336
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,076
Ed, let me tell you something
I learned at the protest.

337
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,287
White people born in America
protest differently

338
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,541
than people of color
and other people not born in America.

339
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,210
We were down there,
all marching together,

340
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,712
everything's going fantastic.
We're marching, moving forward.

341
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,549
And then suddenly
the riot police came out,

342
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,217
and I was like, "Oh, shit.

343
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,888
I'm just gonna go protest
over here for a minute."

344
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,475
[chuckles]

345
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,647
But the white dudes did not care.

346
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,276
They're just, "Out of my way, copper.
Here I come. It's my right.

347
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,821
Here I come, copper. Out of my way.
It's my right."

348
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,077
He was just walking.
"It's my Third Amendment,

349
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,079
my Ninth Amendment."
He knew the amendments!

350
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,291
"It's my 45th Amendment right."

351
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,085
I was in the back.
"There's 45 amendments?"

352
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,512
I swear to God, I saw a white guy

353
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,223
with his finger in the face
of the riot police guy,

354
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:20,474
just waving his finger,

355
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,394
and the riot cop had his hand
on his baton, ready to go.

356
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,689
He was waving. I'm in the back.
I'm like, "Calm down, white guy!

357
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,153
You're gonna get us in trouble!"

358
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,283
The Mexican guy:
"Now's a good time to go to the bathroom.

359
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,957
Feet don't fail me now!"

360
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,837
Guys, I was so scared at the protest.
I'll tell you how scared I was.

361
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,714
I took my passport to the protest.

362
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:57,303
Yeah. Who takes their passport
to a protest?

363
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,013
Immigrant.

364
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,557
I wasn't gonna get deported.

365
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,519
If the cops stop me, "Officer,
I'm with you. God bless America.

366
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,146
God bless you.

367
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,989
Make America great again, Officer.

368
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,533
Officer, I'm with you,
but my cousin Majid...

369
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,118
you can have him if you want."

370
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,417
My God. As you can tell,
I'm a Democrat, I'm liberal,

371
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,044
but I have Republican friends.

372
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,207
I love you no matter what side you're on,
whether you're Democrat, Republican.

373
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,524
If you're Republican, I love you.

374
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:36,485
Even though you did what you did,
I still love you.

375
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,304
Election night, I was at a party
with a lot of my liberal friends,

376
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,474
and when Hillary lost,
my liberal friends were devastated.

377
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,185
They were crying. They were devastated.

378
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:50,064
And I, too, was devastated,
but not just because she lost,

379
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:55,945
but also because I donated $1,000
to her campaign.

380
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:01,283
So, as I was watching her lose on TV,
I'm like, "This bitch...

381
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,210
just lost me $1,000!

382
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,508
You mean I didn't have to donate $1,000?"

383
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,052
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not such a baller

384
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,847
that I just donated $1,000
out the gate. No.

385
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,475
I donated 250 because I felt
that's what I could afford.

386
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,394
That was my civic duty. It was done.

387
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,606
But any of you, if you donated
to either side, you know how it works.

388
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,776
They email you a week later
asking you to donate again.

389
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,904
So, a week later, I got an email:
"Maz, thanks for the 250.

390
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,199
But if you give us 250 more,

391
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,443
you'll put us over the top.
We're gonna win this shit."

392
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,665
I'm such an idiot. "Honey,
I just got an email from Hillary Clinton.

393
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,132
She said 250 more, they're gonna win it.
It's on our shoulders."

394
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,177
I fell for that shit four times.

395
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,894
Who's the asshole now?

396
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,982
I still remember that night. Oh, my God.

397
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,902
I was shocked.
Everybody was shocked when Hillary lost.

398
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,779
Trump was shocked when he won.

399
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,281
He didn't expect to win.

400
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,242
Go look at the video of when
he comes up on the stage when he wins.

401
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,829
Watch how slowly he walks.
He can't believe we voted for him.

402
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,165
He's like, "Are you sure?
They voted for me?

403
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,960
After all the shit I said,
they voted for me? Really?

404
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,378
Oh, my God!"

405
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,424
I actually don't think he wanted to win.

406
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,010
I don't. Yeah, I'm telling you.

407
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,262
I'm serious.

408
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:50,392
He's a megalomaniac billionaire
businessman who likes to tweet.

409
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,685
He didn't want to win.

410
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,687
He was trying to say crazier
and crazier stuff,

411
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,940
hoping we wouldn't vote for him,
but we voted for him.

412
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,983
I knew he wanted to lose
when he came out and said

413
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,861
that Barack Obama was the founder of ISIS.

414
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,090
Remember when he said that?
"Barack Obama is the founder of ISIS."

415
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,243
Then the next day,
he goes on a conservative radio show,

416
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,328
and the announcer tries to help him out.

417
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,914
He goes, "Sir, do you mean
that Barack Obama's policies

418
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,334
led to the creation of ISIS
and therefore where we are right now?"

419
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,585
And he goes, "Nope.

420
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,676
I mean Barack Obama
is the founder of ISIS."

421
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,556
I was watching that. I'm like,
"This motherfucker's trying to lose!"

422
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,310
Oh, my God.

423
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,730
But people voted for him.
Again, some of you might be here.

424
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:40,150
The number-one thing I heard
a lot of Trump voters say:

425
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:43,571
"I love him because he says
what's on his mind.

426
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,325
He just says what's on his mind.
He just says what's on his mind!"

427
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,054
You go, "What are your thoughts
on his policies?"

428
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:55,291
"I don't know about his policies.
He just says what's on his mind."

429
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,961
I thought that was the dumbest thing
I'd ever heard

430
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,463
till I went to visit... Yeah, seriously.

431
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:09,138
I thought that was the dumbest thing
I'd ever heard

432
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,600
till I went to visit my mother,
my own mother. Iranian lady.

433
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,685
She had fallen for the line.

434
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:18,063
My own mother.
She goes, "Maz, I like this guy

435
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,984
because he say what is on his mind."

436
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,821
I go, "Mom, are you crazy?
He's anti-immigrant.

437
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,782
If he becomes President,
your relatives can't come to visit you."

438
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,826
She goes, "I don't like them anyway."

439
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,127
She goes, "Maz,
he say what is on his mind

440
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,421
so I don't have to say
what is on my mind...

441
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,175
which is, 'Stop visiting me,
you cheap bastards!

442
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:49,178
What am I, the Air-b-and-the-b?'"

443
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,183
Right?

444
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,735
A lot of immigrants like Trump.
A lot of immigrants get in this country,

445
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,820
and they don't want
any more of them coming.

446
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,532
I was in an Uber
with an older Armenian guy.

447
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:14,203
This guy loved Trump.
Barely spoke English, but he loved Trump.

448
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,966
Whole drive, he was trying to tell me
what a great politician he is.

449
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,041
He kept saying
what a great "politic" he is.

450
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,795
The whole drive, the Armenian guy:
"Donald Trump, number-one politic.

451
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,297
Very good politic. Number-one politic.

452
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:29,301
Very good number-one politic.
Number-one very good politic."

453
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:32,596
Finally, I go, "Dude, he's anti-immigrant.
You're an immigrant!"

454
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,515
He goes, "Yes, but I'm here.

455
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,731
For me, good politic.

456
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,984
For my cousin, not good politic.
Very bad."

457
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,695
I go, "You got a cousin Majid, too?"

458
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,534
But no matter what you say about Trump,

459
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,619
you have to admit he does say
what's on his mind.

460
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,871
He does say what's on his mind.

461
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,957
Like when he said,
"If you want to pick up women,

462
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,750
you gotta grab them by the pussy."

463
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:04,253
Yeah, I know.
I didn't say it. He said it.

464
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,757
I know. I got so upset, I went to my mom.
"Mom, did you hear what your guy said?

465
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,681
He said if you want to pick up women,
you gotta grab them by the pussy."

466
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,971
My mom goes, "Reminds me of your father.

467
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,484
May God rest his soul.

468
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,029
And his hands.

469
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,033
His very busy hands."

470
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,286
Guys, think about it.

471
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,497
This is now part
of our presidential political history.

472
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,168
It's gonna be in the books.
Our kids will have to study it.

473
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,755
Our kids are gonna study.
John F. Kennedy said,

474
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:50,466
"Ask not what your country
can do for you.

475
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,968
Ask what you can do for your country."

476
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,846
And Donald J. Trump said,
"Grab them by the pussy!"

477
00:25:58,849 --> 00:25:59,850
Yeah!

478
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,731
It's in the books.

479
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:09,735
And then the next day, his supporters:
"It was just one pussy.

480
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,819
What are you all...

481
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,698
The pussy was there, he grabbed it.
What are you gonna do with a pussy?

482
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,867
You'd grab a pussy, too!
Wouldn't you grab a pussy?"

483
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,121
He himself came out and said
it was "locker room talk."

484
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,791
Guys, in my 45 years as a man,

485
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:27,211
none of my friends have ever told me
that that was the move.

486
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:43,018
I thought maybe that's why
I wasn't getting laid in high school.

487
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:46,456
I didn't know that was the move,
you were supposed to walk up...

488
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,482
"Hey, Gwen, how you doing?
What's going on?

489
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,068
What a beautiful day.
I got you, Gwen! Don't move.

490
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:54,404
I got you. Yeah. Yeah.

491
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,451
Got you by the pussy.

492
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,913
It's like Capture the Flag.
I got you right there.

493
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:03,997
Capture the Flag."

494
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,169
We're living in crazy times.
Because here's what it is:

495
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:12,172
Trump needs to start taking responsibility
for his words,

496
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,759
because his words have meaning.
They do. They do.

497
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,553
They do!

498
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,891
He says stuff,
and there's been a rise to racism,

499
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:26,186
there's been a rise to hate crimes, a lot
of anti-immigrant sentiment out there.

500
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,940
He needs to take responsibility, because
the things he does emboldens racists.

501
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,068
There was that guy in Kansas
who went out and shot two Indians,

502
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,404
and then went and told someone
that he shot two Iranians.

503
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,365
Got the wrong people,
but he still... whatever.

504
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,369
It's crazy. And then the Arabs, forget it.
You guys, don't even...

505
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,164
Don't speak Arabic on an airplane,
or you're not going anywhere.

506
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,751
You know what I'm talking about?
Even before Trump was president,

507
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,461
did you hear about the Iraqi guy

508
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:54,631
who was on a Southwest flight
going from LA to San Francisco?

509
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:57,426
He was on the phone, speaking Arabic
to his father on the phone.

510
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,553
Passengers overheard him,
kicked him off the plane.

511
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,076
You heard about that, right?
You're nodding. What's your name?

512
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,891
- Isa.
- Isa. You heard about that, right?

513
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,186
This poor guy was just walking
down the aisle, Arabic on the...

514
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,437
Just walking down, like...

515
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,647
<i>"Halamaha, halamaha, halamaha."</i>

516
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,942
That's not Arabic,
but that's what it sounds like.

517
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,112
He was just going<i>,</i>
<i>"Halamaha, halamaha, halamaha."</i>

518
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,531
Isa, does that mean anything<i>...</i>
<i>"Halamaha, halamaha"?</i>

519
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,617
Am I getting close?
How about<i> "Hala, alamahala"?</i>

520
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,701
Is that closer?

521
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,705
I feel like I'm saying something.
<i>"Halamahala!"</i>

522
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,460
This poor guy, just going,
<i>"Halamaha, halamaha."</i>

523
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,505
I'm not sure if that's how he was walking,
because that's not very threatening.

524
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,342
If he was going<i>,</i>
<i>"Halamaha, halamaha, halamaha."</i>

525
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,429
The passengers would be like,
"There's a gay Arab dude...

526
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:49,478
sashaying down the aisle.

527
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:53,607
He's just going,
<i>'Halamaha, halamaha, halamaha.</i>

528
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,026
Chanel No. 5.
<i>Halamaha, halamaha.'"</i>

529
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,116
I'm telling all my Arab friends,
do not <i>"halamahala"</i> on a plane.

530
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,744
Because <i>"halamahala"</i> is not flying.

531
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,705
You <i>"halamahala,"</i>
you're gonna end up on a bus.

532
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:09,909
Not sure where you're going.

533
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,418
People are afraid of immigrants.

534
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,755
And if you watch Fox News
or any of those networks,

535
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,799
you, too, will be afraid of immigrants.

536
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,261
Oh, my God. I tried to watch
a half an hour of Fox News.

537
00:29:22,344 --> 00:29:24,012
I was afraid of immigrants.

538
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,348
Guys, I swear to God,

539
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,601
there's so much death and destruction
and Armageddon on the...

540
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:32,187
There's a lady... Judge Jeanine Pirro...
Oh, my God.

541
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,857
This lady is always screaming at the TV,
like, "The end of the world is coming."

542
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,402
And she's really upset and angry.

543
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,612
"Yeah, here we go..."
[grumbles]

544
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:42,531
I tried watching once.
She was freaking out.

545
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,866
She has this digital American flag
behind her.

546
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,452
She's like, "The Mexicans
are gonna take our jobs,

547
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:51,123
and the Muslims are gonna kill us,
and we're gonna get eaten by sharks.

548
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,459
We're gonna get eaten
by Mexican Muslim sharks!

549
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,754
With the Zika virus!"

550
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,465
I was like, "Aah!"

551
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,594
You need a break.
Guys, the way I take a break:

552
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,155
I watch sports. That's how I take a break.

553
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,182
My wife watches the Kardashians.
That's her break.

554
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,333
I know, it's just brain-dead stuff.
You know what I'm saying?

555
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,354
Like, I don't pay attention to the...

556
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:17,107
The only time I paid attention
to the Kardashians

557
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,901
was when Bruce Jenner
became Caitlyn Jenner.

558
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,278
Right? Remember that?

559
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,989
I know some of the Middle Eastern people
get uncomfortable

560
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,365
when I talk about that stuff.

561
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,660
Right now, Ed... "Maz, please talk more
about the Trump politics.

562
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:29,911
I don't want to talk about...

563
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,415
Sex change make me very uncomfortable."

564
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,710
Guys, I'm all for it, all right?

565
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,754
Anybody that knows
with that much conviction

566
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,298
that they want to be another sex,
good for them.

567
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,382
Yeah!

568
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,217
I'm serious.

569
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,724
That guy knew that he wanted
to be a woman, all right?

570
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,976
I can't even decide
what to eat for dinner.

571
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,708
Ask me,
"What do you want for dinner?"

572
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,899
"I don't know. Sushi, Italian,
Chinese, I'm not sure."

573
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,150
This guy? "Woman."

574
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,561
Ask me, "Want to be a woman?"

575
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,030
"I don't know. Let's have some sushi.
We can talk about it."

576
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,195
I'm very liberal when it comes
to that kind of stuff.

577
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,496
Even when gay marriage became legal
all over the country, I was so excited.

578
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:15,290
I sent out a tweet:
"Congratulations to my gay friends.

579
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:16,534
You can finally get married."

580
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,627
An Arab dude tweeted me back:

581
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,089
"Maz, gay marriage is not accepted
in our communities."

582
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,972
I hit him back. I go,
"What are you afraid of?

583
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,593
They're gonna start proposing to you,
you hairy bastard?"

584
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:29,805
Right?

585
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,104
You think you'll be walking
down the street,

586
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,940
a gay guy's just gonna jump
out of a bush? 'Marry me!'"

587
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,533
Stop judging, man.
Take care of yourself first.

588
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:51,660
Right? Deal with yourself first.

589
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,037
Oh!

590
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,500
And it's been positive news
for the LGBT community.

591
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,837
It's been positive news
for the LGBT community. Yeah.

592
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:09,344
Now, I know right now
there's a group of Persians in the back,

593
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,429
they're confused.

594
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,933
I guarantee you someone's dad
does not know what "LGBT community" is.

595
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,060
They think it's a bank. I guarantee you.

596
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:21,857
I swear, right now there's a guy:
"LGBT Community Bank?

597
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:27,362
Maz, I am with HSBC,
but I can go LGBT.

598
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,948
Is good interest rates?"

599
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:35,829
"LGBT" stands for "lesbian, gay,
bi and transgender."

600
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,456
They just got more confused.

601
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,543
"He said 'buy' and 'transaction.'
That's a bank."

602
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,341
He was an Olympic champ, man.
I watched the...

603
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,595
My mom was watching the last Olympics
when Usain Bolt won.

604
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,347
Right? Fastest man in the world.
Usain Bolt won.

605
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,225
My mom called me up.
"Maz, did you see?

606
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,019
Hossein Bolt just won."

607
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,231
I go, "Mom, it's Usain."
"No, it's Hossein. They forgot the 'H'."

608
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,568
I go, "Mom, it's Usain. He's a Jamaican."

609
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,236
"No, he's one of us. Hossein.

610
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,573
He's Iranian, maybe Arab.
But he's Hossein."

611
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,242
I go, "Mom, he's black."
"We have black people!

612
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,244
Southern part of Iran,
we have black people."

613
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:21,166
She was... She was trying to take credit
for Usain Bolt.

614
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,754
You know how much it's got to suck
to race against Usain Bolt?

615
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,548
Because you know you're gonna lose
every time.

616
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:32,093
Every one of those guys at the Olympics
had to train four years of their lives.

617
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:34,554
Eat right, exercise, do everything right,
sleep right,

618
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:37,516
fly to the other side of the world.
They show up at the starting line,

619
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,934
and Usain Bolt shows up.

620
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,480
Every one of them was hoping he would have
food poisoning from the night before.

621
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:48,193
Every one... "Oh, come on!
This is bullshit!"

622
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:51,738
If I trained four years of my life,

623
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,074
ran, exercised, slept right,
did everything right,

624
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,660
flew to the other side of the world,
Usain Bolt showed up,

625
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,996
I would do something to get noticed.
Something.

626
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,332
When the hit the gun,
I'd go the other way.

627
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:12,551
Think about it.
They would have to interview you.

628
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,639
Right?

629
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,568
They'd have to come up after the race.
"Why'd you go the other way?"

630
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,695
"In my country, you hear a gun,
you go that way.

631
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,491
We have war in my country.

632
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,077
Let me come to your country, please!"

633
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,621
Oh, my God.

634
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,459
Where's the guys
that are in their forties?

635
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,879
Guys in your forties, where are you,
by applause? There you go, right there.

636
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,047
What's your name?

637
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,301
- Farid.
- Farid, how old are you?

638
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,428
- Forty-something.
- Forty-something?

639
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,222
That's 49 1/2.

640
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,979
Farid, I'm 45. Let me ask you a question.
When you watch the Olympics,

641
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,398
do you still,
in the back of your mind, think

642
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,983
if you started training right now...

643
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,614
that in four years
you could compete in one of the events?

644
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,824
Do you still have that fantasy?

645
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,785
Farid, I have not given up.
I still watch.

646
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,579
I go, "I could do some of this shit."

647
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:26,166
I was watching the diving.
I go, "I could do the diving."

648
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,544
If I trained four years of my life,
every day, I thought I could do it.

649
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:30,712
Farid, I'm not delusional.

650
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,214
I wouldn't start the first day
on the high dive,

651
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,467
do a triple axel.
You know what I'm saying?

652
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,470
The first week, I would just bounce.
Just one week...

653
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,014
Just one week, I'd bounce.

654
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,024
Week two: Cannonball.
I'd work my way up.

655
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,529
Farid, I got so into it that I actually
started doing the research.

656
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,532
I go, "There's gotta be a team
that needs a diver."

657
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,035
Not Team USA,
because USA always has the best.

658
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,079
I thought maybe Iran could use a diver.

659
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,958
I actually researched to see
what Iran won the medals in last time.

660
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:12,170
They won in taekwondo,
wrestling and weightlifting.

661
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,089
All individual sports.

662
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,091
We can only do individual sports.

663
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,135
Yeah. People from that part of the world,

664
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,472
Iranians, Arabs, Armenians, Indians,
we can only do individual.

665
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,057
We can't do team sports.

666
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,518
No, because we don't get along
with each other.

667
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:30,230
We'll never win the World Cup
because we argue with each other.

668
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:32,774
You know what I'm saying?

669
00:36:39,406 --> 00:36:41,741
Guys, I've played soccer my whole life.

670
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,035
Anytime I've played
on a team with Iranians,

671
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,913
we start the game with 11 players,
end it with three.

672
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,419
And it's not because the referee
gives us red cards.

673
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,170
No, we argue and walk off.

674
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:59,092
Every game, there's a guy:
"Pass the ball! Pass the ball!

675
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,404
You don't pass, I'm leaving!
You don't pass the ball, I'm gonna go.

676
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,679
You gotta pass the ball!"

677
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,733
Every game. And then one hour later,
we're all at a Persian restaurant.

678
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:15,942
It's a love-fest.

679
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:18,820
One hour later, same guy:
"I'm so sorry.

680
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,615
Listen, buddy, I love you.
I love you. I got crazy. I get crazy.

681
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,452
You didn't pass. I was open.
You didn't pass. I was open.

682
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:29,289
I was open. Open.
You didn't pass the ball!

683
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,041
I love you. Next time, pass the ball.

684
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:35,295
For now, pass the kebab.
Pass the kebab for now.

685
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,380
Next... "

686
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,804
Guys, I got so into this

687
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:48,433
that I actually started watching to see...
watched the competition a little bit.

688
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:51,978
I was watching the diving team,
and the announcer comes on.

689
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,314
He goes, "Diving next for China,

690
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,566
Ming Ling Li just turned ten."

691
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,985
I was like, "Shit!

692
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,238
I'm old enough to be
her great-grandfather."

693
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,950
Maybe I can babysit at the next Olympics.

694
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,205
Athletes remind you
you're getting older.

695
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,708
Athletes and kids.
Who's got young kids here? Anybody?

696
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:17,128
There you go. Farid. Right there.
Farid, how old are your kids?

697
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,922
I have a five-year-old
and two-and-a-half.

698
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:22,383
Five and two-and-a-half. Adorable, right?
You love them, right?

699
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,345
But they're also
the most exhausting people in the world.

700
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,990
Those who don't have kids,
let me explain what it's like.

701
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,558
When you don't have kids,
when a three-day weekend comes up...

702
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:34,187
Monday's off...
when you don't have kids, you make plans.

703
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,272
When you don't have kids...
"My God. Monday's off?

704
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,483
Let's go to the beach,
then we'll go to a barbeque,

705
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,028
and then we'll go see a movie,
and then we can go get a tattoo,

706
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,696
and then adopt a pet.

707
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,533
Then we go for a hike,
then we take a nap,

708
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,077
then we go for another hike,
but backwards the second time."

709
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,413
You make plans.

710
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:55,875
When you have kids, first of all,
you forget that Monday's off...

711
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,504
until you wake up on Monday
and they're still there.

712
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,596
You turn to your wife, like,
"Why aren't they going to school?!

713
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,684
Presidents' Day?!

714
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,520
What kind of bullshit is that?

715
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:24,028
How are they gonna become president
if they don't go to school?

716
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,241
They should totally go to school."

717
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,910
This is how exhausting kids are.

718
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:34,873
A little while ago, Los Angeles
Unified School District... LAUSD...

719
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,167
got a terrorist bomb threat,
shut down every school in LA.

720
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:41,004
Every kid in LA was sent home.

721
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:44,674
Every parent in LA was like, "Aah!

722
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,175
Shit!

723
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:48,595
Are you sure it's real?

724
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,516
Could we wait and see what happens?

725
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,022
I had plans!"

726
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,485
Farid, my kids don't go to public school.
They go to private school,

727
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,904
so they gave us an option.

728
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:08,990
They said we could either send them
to school or keep them at home.

729
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,744
I was honest with them. I go,
"Guys, Daddy's paid. You're going."

730
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,707
But I gave them advice. I said,
"You see a bomb, just go the other way."

731
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:22,253
But I told them, "Go back to Math class.
I paid for the full day, though."

732
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,632
Guys, I did that joke.
My eight-year-old son was in the audience.

733
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,515
He came up to me after the show,
goes, "Daddy,

734
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,261
remember that day you sent us to school
on terrorist bomb day?"

735
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,474
I go, "Yeah." He goes,
"There was only four of us there."

736
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,770
I was like, "Shit."

737
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,481
And he goes, "And two of us
was me and my sister!"

738
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,783
I go, "Actually, I didn't want you to go.
Your mother wanted you to go.

739
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,036
I love you. She's al-Qaeda.

740
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,749
If you see something, say something.

741
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,752
That's all I'm saying."

742
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,878
[chuckles]

743
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,800
I don't know if you guys remember that.
It was crazy.

744
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,552
Los Angeles Unified School District
got the terrorist bomb threat,

745
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,637
shut it down.

746
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,140
New York City got the exact same
bomb threat on that same day.

747
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,184
Did not shut it down.

748
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,312
That's the day I realized,
in LA, we are pussies.

749
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:24,875
Soon as we got the bomb threat:
"Shut it down, close the schools,

750
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,776
lock it up, everyone inside, inside!

751
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,737
You want to go in the backyard and play?
Just put on some sunblock.

752
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,501
We have a lot of sun rays in Los Angeles.
You gotta put on sunblock.

753
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,409
You want to eat lunch?
Okay, organic only,

754
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,953
because we only eat organic
in Los Angeles, okay?

755
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,076
You want some grapes?
Can you please cut the grapes?

756
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,541
Our kids in Los Angeles
don't know how to chew grapes.

757
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,750
You gotta cut the grapes.

758
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,420
If you give them a full grape,
they just choke.

759
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:57,807
Our kids in LA don't know how to just...
[chewing noises]

760
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,559
They can't..."
[chewing noises]

761
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,895
Meanwhile, New York City
got the exact same bomb threat.

762
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,272
"Yo, ISIS!

763
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,400
I got your bomb threat right here!

764
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,118
Right here, ISIS! Right here!"

765
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,205
And that was
the five-year-old schoolgirls.

766
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,917
That's how they talk in New York City.

767
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,130
Guys, I guarantee you, right now
there's a group of Persians in the back...

768
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,590
"Oh, my God.

769
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,096
He grabbed his balls!

770
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,516
I thought he was gonna do
political material.

771
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,269
Why did he grab his balls?!"

772
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,480
[speaking Farsi]

773
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,905
Ed, <i>"tokhm"</i> means "balls."

774
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,157
Go for it. Say it. <i>Tokhm.</i>

775
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:58,367
<i>- Tokh?</i>
- No. <i>Tokhm!</i>

776
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,495
<i>- Tokh.</i>
- No. <i>Tokhm!</i>

777
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,913
With a "T" and then "khm."

778
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:04,499
<i>- Tokhm!
- Tokhm.</i>

779
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,000
<i>- Tokhm!
- Tokhm.</i>

780
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,211
But quick with the "M".
Not too long with the "M".

781
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,505
You don't want <i>"Tokhmmm."</i>
That's something else.

782
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:14,675
- Just <i>tokhm!</i>
<i>- Tokhm!</i>

783
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,010
That's pretty good.

784
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,262
See?

785
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:20,765
This is a...

786
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,498
This is a learning experience,
ladies and gentlemen.

787
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:28,940
Immigrants giving to the culture.

788
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,027
Arabs, how do you say "balls" in Arabic?

789
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,570
- [woman] <i>Baydat!</i>
<i>- Baydat!</i>

790
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:37,949
<i>Baydat? </i>
Like, "Don't buy this,<i> baydat." </i>

791
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,662
Arabs are always trying
to sell you something.

792
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:47,333
"Don't buy this. <i>Baydat!</i>

793
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,377
<i>Baydat!</i>

794
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:51,796
I give you good discount."

795
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,425
Stephanie, how do you say "balls"
in Chinese?

796
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:58,429
That's a good one. I want to hear that.
Teach us.

797
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,097
- How do you say "balls" in Chinese?
- I have no idea.

798
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,181
You have no idea.

799
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:05,852
What the hell happened
to your guys' languages?

800
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,353
- [woman]<i> Qiú!</i>
- What is it?

801
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,729
<i>- Qiú.</i>
- Chill?

802
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,731
<i>- Qiú.
- Qiú?</i>

803
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,441
C-H...

804
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,526
-Q-I-A-O.

805
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,570
U-I-A-O? <i>Chuiao!</i>

806
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,533
There's a lot of vowels in your balls.

807
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,453
Right? <i>Chuiao!</i>

808
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,875
They way you do Chinese: "C", "H", "I,"
"A", "O", "U", sometimes "Y".

809
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,836
<i>Chuiao!</i>

810
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,255
I love it. <i>Chuiao. Chuiao.</i>

811
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,548
That's pretty close.

812
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,425
Urdu. How do you say it in Urdu?

813
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:38,926
- [man]<i> Tattay.</i>
- What?

814
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:40,928
<i>- Tattay.</i>
- What?

815
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:42,096
<i>Tattay!</i>

816
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:51,480
I feel like you have to go, <i>"Tattay."</i>

817
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:54,150
<i>Tattay.</i>

818
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,320
<i>Tattay.</i>

819
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,999
Right? <i>Tattay.</i>

820
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:19,425
Someone raised their hand over here.
Yes. What language?

821
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,843
- [woman] Ukrainian.
- Ukrainian.

822
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,429
Oh, shit. How do you say "balls"
in Ukrainian?

823
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,932
<i>- Yaytsya.</i>
- What?!

824
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,352
<i> Yaytsya? Yaytsya?</i>

825
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,479
Sounds like they're shocked
to see the balls.

826
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,982
In Ukraine: <i>"Yaytsya!"</i>

827
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:47,370
[woman] Sign language!

828
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,413
Did you just say "sign language"?

829
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,875
You got sign language?!
Oh, no. Really?

830
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,169
This is how you do "balls"
in sign language.

831
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,048
You win.

832
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,270
That's the best.
Show me again. How do you do it?

833
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,689
You gotta go down, and then up.

834
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:20,236
You sure those aren't elephant balls?

835
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:29,495
I love it!

836
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:34,333
See, guys? Immigrants are contributing
to America as we speak.

837
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:37,545
That's all I'm saying.
That's all I'm saying.

838
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,049
How did we end up on balls?

839
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,592
Oh, yeah. My kids.

840
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,138
Farid...

841
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:51,726
are you guys raising your kids modern
or traditional?

842
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,894
- As modern as possible.
- As modern as possible.

843
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:56,397
I started hearing a lot of people complain
about things

844
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,524
I never knew we were supposed
to complain about.

845
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,776
I started hearing people come up
and be like,

846
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,445
"My dad never played catch with me."

847
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,696
[whining]

848
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:06,449
I tell him, "My dad, Iranian dad...

849
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,327
Immigrant dads don't play catch
with anybody."

850
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,204
I came to America, six years old.

851
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:15,124
If I went to my dad when I was six,
asked him to play catch...

852
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,792
"Hey, Dad, let's play catch,"

853
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:19,253
he'd be like,
"You're lucky you're in America.

854
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,467
You want play catch?
I send you to Iran.

855
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:27,261
You can play catch with Khomeini
and Saddam Hussein."

856
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,229
I guess we're not playing catch.

857
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,151
The things people will say. People say,
"My dad never said, 'I love you.'"

858
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,235
[whining]

859
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,071
I tell them, "My dad, Iranian dad...

860
00:47:45,154 --> 00:47:47,698
Immigrant dads don't even know
what that means."

861
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,509
If I went to my dad...
"Dad, do you love me?"

862
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,910
"Ehh.

863
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,039
I am growing used to you."

864
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,378
Immigrant dads don't say...

865
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,671
Immigrant parents don't say
"I love you" all the time.

866
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:05,716
In America, we have to tell our kids
we love them all day long.

867
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,468
In the morning, "I love you."

868
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,637
Lunchtime, "I still love you."

869
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,616
Afternoon, "I loved you more
than lunch and breakfast.

870
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,974
I love you even more now."

871
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,853
Even when they get in trouble,
you gotta tell them you love them.

872
00:48:17,937 --> 00:48:20,022
My son gets in trouble...
"You're in big trouble.

873
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:22,483
You did not clean your room!
But just know that I love you.

874
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,568
I'm your father.
I will always be here for you.

875
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,989
I am the wind beneath your wings.
I love you so much.

876
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,158
I don't want you to grow up
and have issues with me.

877
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,994
I love you so much,
I'm gonna clean your room for you.

878
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,415
I love you more
than your mother loves you.

879
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:39,875
She sent you to school
on terrorist bomb day."

880
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:44,964
Immigrant parents don't say they love you.

881
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:49,093
My parents had sayings that indicated
that they might love us.

882
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:53,722
My dad always used to say,
"You're the light of my eyes.

883
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,142
You're the light of my eyes."

884
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,768
[speaking Farsi]

885
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,020
"You're the light of my eyes!"

886
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,355
You'd be like, "Wow!"

887
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,774
Yeah, don't clap. Don't clap.

888
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:06,318
Because I would be like,
"Wow, does that mean you love me?"

889
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:07,820
He'd be like, "Ehh.

890
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,450
That means I can see you in the dark.

891
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,498
Watch what you're doing."

892
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,379
Oh, my God.

893
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,841
Kids are running the world now, man.
You know how I know?

894
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,885
Because when I was a kid,
I used to have to play

895
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,304
with the kids of my parents' friends.

896
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,724
Now I have to play with the parents
of my kids' friends.

897
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,104
Yeah. I'd be five years old.

898
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:44,523
As soon as we entered the party
with my dad,

899
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:48,194
we'd show up. My dad:
"Go. Go play with Amir."

900
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,905
"I don't want to play with Amir!"

901
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,365
"Go play with Amir!"

902
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,118
"Amir's 29 years old!"

903
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:05,377
"That's not my problem.
That's his problem.

904
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,298
Till he finds good wife, he's their son.
Go play with him."

905
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,344
I was five. I'd run in the room...
"Hi, Amir. You have any Legos?"

906
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,138
"No, dude. I have weed."

907
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,480
Here's another way I know
that kids are running the world.

908
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:27,066
You know how many parties
my wife and I have left

909
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:32,029
because the kids need to go home
and unwind and rewind and wound down?

910
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:35,950
You know how many parties we've been at?
It's been happening.

911
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,368
"Guys, what a great party.

912
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:39,578
It was just getting started,
but we gotta go home.

913
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:42,081
The kids gotta unwind and rewind
and wound down.

914
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,543
I know, you just brought out
the best tequila. We were gonna party,

915
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:49,255
but we gotta go home. The kids gotta
unwind and rewind and wound down.

916
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:52,591
I know, we were just about
to have an orgy, but we gotta go home.

917
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:56,053
The kids gotta unwind, rewind
and wound down."

918
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:59,723
My parents did not leave one party

919
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:02,893
for us to go home and unwind
and rewind and wound down.

920
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:05,771
Not one.

921
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,613
If we got tired at a party,
they'd be like, "You want to sleep? Okay.

922
00:51:14,697 --> 00:51:16,782
Go find a pile of coats.

923
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:22,037
Fall asleep on the coats.
Make sure one of the coats is my coat

924
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:24,290
so I don't forget you
when I'm going home."

925
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:33,632
You would constantly be asleep
on a pile of coats, and they'd come,

926
00:51:33,716 --> 00:51:36,927
they wouldn't even wake you up.
They just throw you over their shoulders.

927
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:40,514
You'd be half-asleep. You'd think
you're being kidnapped every night.

928
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,601
They'd throw you
over their shoulders.

929
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:45,936
You'd be, "Oh, my God,
this is the fifth time this week.

930
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,271
They kidnapped me again!"

931
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,483
And they thought
they were doing good parenting.

932
00:51:51,567 --> 00:51:52,985
They didn't know any better.

933
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,904
"Hossein, look what a good father I am.

934
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:59,617
I put my son to sleep on a pile of coats.
What a good father.

935
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,994
Hossein, give me a shot of vodka.
I want to celebrate.

936
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,704
Shot of vodka. He's asleep.

937
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,081
Hossein, I'm driving home.
Give me a shot of vodka.

938
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,916
I want to celebrate. Driving home."

939
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,086
We didn't have drunk driving
when I was a kid in Iran.

940
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,964
We didn't have seat belts
when I was a kid in Iran!

941
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,341
You'd be in the back of the car.

942
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,843
Every turn,
you'd end up on a different side.

943
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,311
Your dad in the front:
"Hold on to your sister!

944
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,314
You're her seat belt.

945
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:32,274
I love her.

946
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,569
<i>You</i> are the light of my eyes."

947
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,378
Now, in America, you've got to put
your kid in a car seat

948
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,463
till they're 35 years old.

949
00:52:58,634 --> 00:52:59,843
With a helmet on.

950
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,554
And a video player. Just saying...

951
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:04,390
[mumbling]

952
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,938
Where's the couples without kids?
Where are you?

953
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,691
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

954
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,484
Congratulations.

955
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:20,739
Don't get me wrong. I love my kids.
We love our kids. Right, Farid?

956
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:24,410
But when you don't have kids, you have
so much freedom, you don't even know.

957
00:53:24,493 --> 00:53:25,494
Yeah.

958
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:30,666
If there's any advice I can give you,
take advantage of the freedom you have.

959
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,419
You guys have so much freedom
when you don't have kids.

960
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,004
When you don't have kids,
you go home and just make love.

961
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,256
Just go home and make love.

962
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,467
When you don't have kids,
you go home and role-play.

963
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,803
Yeah, you go home and role-play.

964
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,514
I know some of the Iranians
just got confused again.

965
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,769
I guarantee you right now,
some guy:

966
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,272
"Roll play? They're gonna go bowling?
Why they go bowling?

967
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,065
Why they go... "

968
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,819
Role-play is when you pretend
to be someone else during sex.

969
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,238
When you have no kids,
you guys can go home

970
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,740
and just do Tarzan and Jane.

971
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,325
You go home...
"Hey, go in the other room.

972
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,578
When you hear me 'Tarzan, '
just swing.

973
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,707
Just swing. Use whatever.
Use a chandelier. Just swing in.

974
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,586
We're gonna have sex in this foyer.

975
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,755
When you hear me go...
[Tarzan yell]

976
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,842
Swing in! Sex in the foyer!"

977
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:27,347
When you have kids,
you can't Tarzan and Jane.

978
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,141
Right, Farid?

979
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,603
You can't Tarzan and Jane
when you have kids.

980
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,062
You'd wake the kids up!

981
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,649
It would be the quietest Tarzan and Jane
you've seen your entire life.

982
00:54:38,734 --> 00:54:41,278
When you have kids, you'll be like...
[soft Tarzan yell]

983
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:46,033
[soft Tarzan yell]

984
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,952
"Psst! Jane, wake up.

985
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,007
I told you, don't drink red wine, Jane.

986
00:55:03,175 --> 00:55:04,843
Red wine puts you to sleep, Jane!

987
00:55:05,594 --> 00:55:07,054
Jane, me Tarzan!

988
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,182
Don't leave me out here alone
with Cheetah.

989
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,477
I played with my Cheetah
last night, Jane."

990
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,439
The Iranian guy's confused.

991
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,400
"He has a monkey named Cheetah?"

992
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,281
When you have young kids at the house,
you can't have sex in the foyer.

993
00:55:26,365 --> 00:55:28,617
There's Legos all over the foyer.

994
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:33,705
You ever stood barefoot on Legos?
That shit hurts.

995
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:36,083
You'd be like, "Ow. Jane. Ow.
Wait. Hold on. Jane.

996
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,836
Ow. Jane. Ow. Don't move, Jane. Ow."

997
00:55:39,962 --> 00:55:43,382
When you have kids,
you're too tired to have sex.

998
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:45,926
You know how many nights
my wife and I, we've taken the kids,

999
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:48,804
we've done the unwind, the rewind,
the wound down,

1000
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,889
showered them up, went to tuck them in...

1001
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,684
When you tuck them in,
that's when they start manipulating you.

1002
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,856
You tuck them in, you start walking out.
"Daddy? I'm thirsty."

1003
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,399
[groans]

1004
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,236
"Here's some water.
Hurry up. I might get laid."

1005
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,241
You start walking out.
"Daddy? I'm hungry."

1006
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,325
[groans]

1007
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,704
"Here's a cracker.
Let's go. I still have a chance."

1008
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,932
Start walking out.
"Daddy, I gotta poo."

1009
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,792
"Of course you do, because you ate
and drank when you shouldn't have.

1010
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,965
And now Daddy's not gonna get any
because of you, son. Thanks a lot.

1011
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,676
Daddy's going to bed with blue balls
because of you, son."

1012
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,971
The Iranian guy's confused again.

1013
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:35,434
"Blue balls is bowling.
Blue balls, bowling.

1014
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,312
Blue balls, bowling.
LGBT Community Bank.

1015
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,646
I got the whole show."

1016
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:54,077
You know how many nights
my wife and I have done all that stuff?

1017
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:57,205
The unwind, the rewound, the unbound,
whatever it is,

1018
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:58,707
the tucking them in.

1019
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,918
We end up in bed together.
We are so exhausted.

1020
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:02,920
We look at each other and go,
"Babe...

1021
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,422
why try to have sex
and ruin a good thing?

1022
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,718
We've got Netflix! We've got Netflix!

1023
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,180
Just hold my hand. Scratch.
That's a good... That's a good scratch.

1024
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,558
That's a good... Oh, yeah.
Scratch my head.

1025
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,560
That's a good scratch.
That's a good scratch."

1026
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,730
Yeah, that's what happens.
When you're married with children,

1027
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:22,981
you turn into monkeys.

1028
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,610
Just scratching each other
all day long.

1029
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,988
This is what it is.
You know what it is?

1030
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:33,909
Men and women are just different.
We're both dealing with the same stresses,

1031
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,871
but when you have kids, a man
can disengage and decompress quicker.

1032
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:40,832
When it comes to sex,
men are ready to go anytime, anyplace.

1033
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:44,795
Women need time to decompress,
get in the right frame of mind.

1034
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:48,131
Women, when it comes to sex,
one little thing can throw you off.

1035
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,926
A man could be underneath the house,

1036
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,638
rewiring the house.

1037
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,142
The wires could all be out in the most
precarious, dangerous positions.

1038
00:57:59,226 --> 00:58:02,229
And from the distance, you can hear
his wife just go, "Sex!"

1039
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,523
And a man would go for it.

1040
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:08,360
He would run through the wires,
get electrocuted.

1041
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,571
He'd show up:
"Hey, did you say... Did you...

1042
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,073
[stammering]

1043
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,996
Sex? You said sex? You said sex?

1044
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,623
[stammering]
You said sex? You said sex.

1045
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:24,835
No, I got electrocuted. That's fine.
You said sex!

1046
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,230
I got electrocuted. You said sex!
I gotta go to the hospital.

1047
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,974
Let's have sex.
I gotta go to the hospital."

1048
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,886
Women, very different.
One little thing can throw you off.

1049
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:37,889
A woman could be like,
"I'm not in the mood right now

1050
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:41,476
because my hair
was supposed to be like this,

1051
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,522
but it's like that."

1052
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:49,276
And men, we're so stupid.
We're like, "I got a comb.

1053
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,610
I could comb your hair.

1054
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,866
Then we could go have sex."

1055
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,036
And women: "No, you didn't hear me.

1056
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,913
My hair was supposed to be like this,
but it's like that. Like this."

1057
00:59:01,997 --> 00:59:05,417
"Well, I got a comb and a brush.
I could do your hair, we could have sex."

1058
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,336
We're so dumb, we keep pushing
till the real reason comes out.

1059
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,356
"I got a comb and brush.
I could make this happen."

1060
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,926
"No, you're not hearing me.
My hair was like this, but it's like that.

1061
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,512
You forgot my birthday, asshole!"

1062
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:28,440
"Uh, okay, well... heh heh.
Happy birthday.

1063
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:31,276
Here's the comb.

1064
00:59:32,152 --> 00:59:33,862
Surprise!

1065
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,906
I'm gonna go rewire the house."

1066
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:40,994
That's why, guys, depending on the number
of people you have living at the house,

1067
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:44,664
gotta spend a little more time getting
your wife or girlfriend in the mood.

1068
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:47,310
If you have no kids at the house,
you go home, have a glass of wine,

1069
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,002
make love, it's fantastic.

1070
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,646
When you have a couple of kids
in the house,

1071
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,840
you've got to spend a bit of time getting
your wife in the right frame of mind.

1072
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,510
If you have your kids and the in-laws,

1073
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,638
you're not getting laid.
It's not happening.

1074
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,557
It's too much traffic.
It's not gonna happen.

1075
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:04,601
Really hard to pull off.

1076
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,605
If I want to make love to my wife
at eight o'clock at night,

1077
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,774
I've got to start getting her
mentally prepared

1078
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:12,317
from eight o'clock in the morning.

1079
01:00:13,193 --> 01:00:15,403
I swear to God.
Isa, this happened recently.

1080
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:18,740
I woke up one morning.
I was like, "Today is the day."

1081
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,661
I don't know if it was a full moon.
I was excited.

1082
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:26,164
First moment I saw her,
8:00 in the morning at breakfast,

1083
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,916
I just threw a random compliment.

1084
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:31,128
Just walking by, I go, "Hey, babe.
You're looking good today."

1085
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:36,049
She goes, "Oh, my God.
Thank you for noticing my highlights."

1086
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,052
As I walked away, I was like,
"The seed has been planted."

1087
01:00:41,805 --> 01:00:43,723
It was like <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

1088
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:46,268
Lunchtime: Poetry.

1089
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,728
I don't even know poetry.

1090
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,189
I'm just walking by...
"Hey, babe...

1091
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:52,941
'To be or not to be.'"
That's all I got.

1092
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:59,364
Like, "Oh, my God. Shakespeare.
Thank you so much."

1093
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:01,366
Afternoon: Foot rub.

1094
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,994
She didn't want a foot rub.
I gave her a foot rub.

1095
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:07,122
Started rubbing her feet.
She had dead skin. No big deal.

1096
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,208
I turned it to my advantage.

1097
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:13,128
I go, "Babe, your dead skin
makes me feel alive!"

1098
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,047
She goes, "Eww, that's disgusting."

1099
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,425
I go, "So is my love."

1100
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,595
Yeah, I became Antonio Banderas
for two seconds.

1101
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:25,557
[Spanish accent]
"So is my love. I am Puss in Boots."

1102
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:31,521
I went, I ran, I got the kids tucked in,
everything was done, they're ready to go.

1103
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:34,774
I come running back inside.
I go, "Babe, let's do this!"

1104
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,818
She goes, "I'm not sure
I'm in the mood right now.

1105
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,653
My hair was like this.
Now it's like that."

1106
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:41,781
I go, "Babe, come on.
The kids are asleep.

1107
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:44,367
I did the poetry, the foot rub.
Let's do this.

1108
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,328
And then she goes, "Um...

1109
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,455
okay."

1110
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:52,083
Which isn't the most flattering thing
in the world.

1111
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,337
But for a guy, "okay" is a "yes."

1112
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,758
Men, when it comes to sex,
we have no ego at all.

1113
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,761
All she has to say is,
"Yeah, I got nothing better to do."

1114
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:07,015
A man would be like,
"She's got nothing better to do!

1115
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,184
I'm getting laid!"

1116
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,855
Guys, I thought "okay" meant
that it was a done deal.

1117
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,317
"Okay" does not mean it's a done deal.

1118
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,737
It's not a done deal
till it's a done deal, okay?

1119
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:24,282
I messed up. I got cocky.
I thought "okay" meant we're done.

1120
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:27,786
I got cocky. I went to the bathroom
to go pee just before we get started.

1121
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,747
Just a little tinkle
before we get started.

1122
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,767
Just a little pee,
a little tinkle before we get...

1123
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:34,459
And I farted. Just a little fart.

1124
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:38,189
Just the beginning. Pfft, pfft.
Just the beginning. Pfft, pfft.

1125
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:41,800
Just pfft. Just pfft, pfft, pfft.
Just pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

1126
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:44,195
Just a pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.
Just a pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

1127
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,804
Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.

1128
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:49,224
Somehow, all the way from the other room,
she heard.

1129
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,452
She goes, "Really?" I go, "What?"
She goes, "I'm not in the mood."

1130
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,644
I go, "Come on!"

1131
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:55,939
She goes, "My hair was like this.
Now it's like that.

1132
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,774
There's farts all over the place."

1133
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,736
Now I'm trying to sell her on the fart.
I go, "That wasn't a fart.

1134
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,820
That was a celebratory...
There was more to that...

1135
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,365
I was gonna go pfffffft.

1136
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:06,449
There was more.

1137
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,327
I was just testing to make sure
the kids are asleep.

1138
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:10,412
Pffffft.

1139
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,498
Better that I fart in the bathroom
than during sex.

1140
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,417
You don't want pffffft.
That's not good."

1141
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:20,880
She goes, "I'm not in the mood."
I go, "Neither am I.

1142
01:03:20,964 --> 01:03:24,092
We have a lot of Netflix. Hold my hand.
Just scratch. That's a good scratch."

1143
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,094
Yeah.

1144
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:35,645
And that's based on a true story.

1145
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:37,856
I swear to God.

1146
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,526
Right now, Ed, I guarantee you,
some of the Iranians: "Oh, my God!

1147
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,445
He's doing fart jokes?

1148
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,781
He was supposed to do political material.

1149
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:49,034
Why is he doing fart jokes?"

1150
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,827
[speaking Farsi]

1151
01:03:52,996 --> 01:03:55,915
Ed, <i>"guz"</i> means "fart" in Persian.

1152
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,835
If it makes the sound.
If it's quiet, it's just <i>"choss."</i>

1153
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,590
We're connoisseurs. We have two ways.

1154
01:04:04,424 --> 01:04:05,967
So, give me <i>"guz."</i> Say <i>"guz."</i>

1155
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:10,722
<i>"Guz."</i> And then say <i>"choss."</i>
You're fluent.

1156
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,226
Isa, how do you say "fart" in Arabic?

1157
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:18,897
<i>- "Drat"</i> and <i>"fuss."</i>
- What is it?

1158
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,607
<i>- "Drat."
- "Drav?!"</i>

1159
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,361
Oh, you have two as well?

1160
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:27,072
Look at that.
We have very similar languages.

1161
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:30,784
You got <i>"fuss"?</i>
So, my <i>"choss"</i> becomes your <i>"fuss."</i>

1162
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,536
<i>Choss. Fuss.</i>

1163
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,705
This is like the conversion rate.

1164
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,750
- And <i>"guz"</i> becomes...
<i>- "Drat."</i>

1165
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,001
<i>"Drat."</i>

1166
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,755
It sounds like you're farting.
<i>"Drat!"</i>

1167
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:45,799
Whoo!

1168
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:47,717
<i>"Drat."</i>

1169
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,805
How do you say it in Assyrian?
How do you say "fart"?

1170
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:52,931
<i>- "Arteta."</i>
- What?

1171
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,808
<i>- "Arteta."
- "Arteta."</i>

1172
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,064
Sounds like your fart
is an artist of some sort.

1173
01:05:02,649 --> 01:05:04,442
I give you <i>arteta.</i>

1174
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:07,862
[cheers and applause]

1175
01:05:12,492 --> 01:05:13,701
<i>Arteta.</i>

1176
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:22,710
Do me a favor. Take out your phone.
Somebody google "fart in England."

1177
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:26,381
Yell it. Say what it says. Google.
What does it say? "Fart in England."

1178
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,675
Just google it on your phone. Go ahead.

1179
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,758
- [man] We're gonna get kicked out.
- I'm telling you, don't worry about it.

1180
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:34,848
Google "fart in England."
Say it loud. What does it say?

1181
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,016
- "Trump!"
- "Trump!" "Trump!"

1182
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,687
Yeah! Yes!

1183
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,522
Yes!

1184
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:56,119
In England, they say "trump" for "fart."
They're very smart over there.

1185
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:00,039
Listen, we started with Trump jokes.
We ended with fart jokes.

1186
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,167
We've come full circle. That's the show.

1187

Thank you very much, Kennedy Center.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
