1
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,309
- One or two?
- Let me get three.

2
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,851
Three.

3
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:02,938
How you feelin’, Tracy?

4
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,399
Who’s Tracy?

5
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,712
Y’all do layaway?

6
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,880
What, do I look like a banker to you?

7
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,674
I’m just fucking with you.

8
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,758
What?

9
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,114
Aaah!

10
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,223
Yeah!

11
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,933
Boom!

12
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,395
Wow. That was a lot of love.

13
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:28,857
Yeah, thank you.

14
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,860
Thank you so much. Thank you.

15
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,612
We can get right to it.

16
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,365
Everybody in here know I got hit
by that fucking Walmart truck.

17
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,286
Could’ve been worse.

18
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,247
I could’ve got hit by
a Bob’s Discount Furniture truck.

19
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,958
You know they ain’t got no fucking money.

20
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:52,214
Driven by some dude named Rico.
No license, no insurance.

21
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,757
No registration.

22
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,093
INS is on his ass.

23
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,348
When I was in that wheelchair,
I still shopped at Walmart.

24
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,269
You still can’t beat their prices.

25
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,316
After my settlement,
everything went up a penny.

26
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,541
I’m still here. I ain’t down.
But you know I ain’t shit.

27
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,584
You know I ain’t shit.

28
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,379
’Cause you know that expression,
"Only the good die young."

29
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:37,384
God seen them angels bringing me through
the pearly gates, he said, "Uh-uh.

30
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,178
Take that motherfucker back down.

31
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,392
He gonna do the whole 89 years,
the shit he did in the third grade.

32
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:48,478
Put a bag of doo-doo
on the teacher’s desk.

33
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,398
Just because she failed him
in Social Studies."

34
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,485
When I was in heaven,
I seen some people that I know.

35
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,113
I seen Biggie Smalls.
He looked good, lost weight.

36
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,992
Got that diabetes under control, you know?

37
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,162
Elvis Presley still look
like a piece of shit.

38
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,248
Can’t leave that fried food alone.

39
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,917
Ol’ Dirty Bastard
got ten new kids already.

40
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,964
Michael Jackson told me
what really happened.

41
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,760
He said, "Tracy,
I died in that fucking Pepsi commercial."

42
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,476
But the gravy train was so good
they got a look-alike,

43
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,436
and that motherfucker went crazy.

44
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,105
Start dangling babies out of windows.

45
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,107
Namin’ ’em Blankets and Quilts.

46
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,296
Then he start telling me something
about Latoya and Bubbles.

47
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,040
I said,
"Michael, I don’t want to hear this.

48
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:42,699
Startin’ to come from a bad place."

49
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,535
I seen some people up there I didn’t like.

50
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,371
I seen one dude owed me money
when he was alive.

51
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,249
I asked God, "How’d he get into heaven?
He owe me money."

52
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,960
He said, "Your stupid ass is the one
that lent it to him.

53
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,255
Everybody know Luther don’t pay back.

54
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:58,882
He’s a crackhead. He got a disease.

55
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,344
Now take your ass back down to earth
and be smarter with your money."

56
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,805
And I said,
"God works in mysterious ways."

57
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,350
He had questions for me too.

58
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,144
One day he pull out his cell phone
and show me a picture

59
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:13,522
of Kim Kardashian naked on Instagram.

60
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,022
He said, "How’d she get
those titties and that ass?

61
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,400
I ain’t give that to her.

62
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,113
And why is she showing it
to the whole world?

63
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,491
She’s a married woman with two kids.

64
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,577
Oh, well. At least she don’t have
Ray J’s dick in her."

65
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,215
When I was in that coma, y’all,
I saw the white light.

66
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,593
I saw the white light. But I didn’t go
to it ’cause I thought it was the police.

67
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,555
I got warrants, man.

68
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,848
You can’t get into heaven with priors.

69
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,435
Everything go down in the big book.

70
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,937
Everything.

71
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,690
After my coma, right,
before the accident...

72
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:01,111
I could’ve swore it was three Kardashians,
Kim, Khloé and Kourtney.

73
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,656
And after I came out of the coma,
was six of them motherfuckers.

74
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,952
And one of them won a decathlon in 1976.

75
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,793
Was on a Wheaties box like this.

76
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,301
Caitlyn is a hot MILF.
I’ll fuck the shit out of her.

77
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:29,014
Caitlyn can get this dick.
I’ll fuck the shit out of her.

78
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,560
I’d get her ass pregnant.

79
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,397
You know I’m old school.
I don’t be pulling out.

80
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,652
She might not have a pussy now,
but when I’m done fucking her she will.

81
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,907
Prolapse the shit out of her booty hole.

82
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,995
This is Caitlyn’s butt right here.

83
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,381
She’ll have to go to the hospital
wearing a kilt.

84
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:07,177
"Um, excuse me,
my ass is hanging out of my ass."

85
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,697
"You mean you have hemorrhoids?"

86
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:12,057
"No, my ass is hanging out of my ass."

87
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,058
"Oh, you have colitis."

88
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,185
"No, my ass is hanging out of my ass!"

89
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,646
"What’s your name?" "Caitlyn."

90
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,439
"How do you spell that,
with a ‘C’ or ‘K’?"

91
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,732
"Bruce, bitch!"

92
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,784
I suffered some terrible injuries,
you know?

93
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,954
Traumatic brain injury.

94
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,331
Broke every bone in my face, my ribs.

95
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,291
I pulverized my femur.

96
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,919
And through all of that,
I asked my doctor, I said,

97
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,295
"Is my dick okay?

98
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,050
I don’t need no thighbone, motherfucker.
I need my dick."

99
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,471
That would be horrible if you came out
of a coma and the doctor be like,

100
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,139
"Mr. Morgan, your penis was severed."

101
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,767
I’d be like, "Well, I’m going back
in this coma, motherfucker.

102
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,771
Kill me, motherfucker.
What the fuck am I doing alive?"

103
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,356
I’m suing everybody.

104
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,484
The hospital, the doctors,
especially my wife.

105
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:07,654
’Cause she always called me
a dickless son of a bitch.

106
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,413
Your dick is gone.

107
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,915
And you’re trying to be normal out here.

108
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,970
Goin’ to the club,
trying to pick women up,

109
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:22,544
knowing you can’t do shit for ’em.

110
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,795
"Hey, what up, baby?

111
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,880
Why don’t you come to my house

112
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,425
so I can rug-burn and scissor
the shit out of you.

113
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,513
We’re gonna start a campfire
rubbing these coochies together.

114
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,098
Come on. Let’s rub on it.

115
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,017
Rub on.

116
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,227
Oh, rub on.

117
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,062
Oh, rub it."

118
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,444
I’m from the ghetto, man.
I’m from the ghetto.

119
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,072
And after I came out from the coma,
I was blind for a week.

120
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:53,867
And where I come from,
you don’t want to be blind for a second.

121
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,620
All kind of shit start comin’ up missing
in my hospital room.

122
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,374
One day my uncle was trying to walk out
with my fucking heart monitor.

123
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,520
I said, "Michael, where you going
with my heart machine?"

124
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,213
He said,
"Oh. I was just holding it for you."

125
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,301
Tried to sell it to another hospital.

126
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,138
"Put my heart machine back,
you fucking crackhead."

127
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,726
When I came out of the coma,

128
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:29,778
my whole family came to the hospital
to visit me just to tell me they love me.

129
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,698
My whole family came just to tell me
they love me.

130
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,408
Except for my grandmother.

131
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,745
Like every other old black woman,
all she care about is education.

132
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,039
I’m like, "Grandma...

133
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:43,291
I made it.

134
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,251
I survived."

135
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,754
She said, "Good. Now you can go back
and get your GED.

136
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,966
Do something with your damn self.
You got a second chance."

137
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:57,013
I said, "But, Grandma, I was on <i>30 Rock."</i>

138
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,974
She said, "If you had your GED,
you’d have been on <i>60 Rock.</i>

139
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,769
Go get your fucking GED.

140
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,688
Get your goddamn GED."

141
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,401
Now, she one of them old Southern women.
Church and shit, you know?

142
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,654
So she prays all the time.

143
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,906
One morning I woke up,
she was praying over me.

144
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:18,701
And I said,
"Grandma, stop praying over me.

145
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,329
I already died and went to heaven
and spoke to God."

146
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,497
She said, "What’d he say?"

147
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,917
I said, "God said, ‘Tell your grandmother
to shut the fuck up!

148
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,172
Between her and Tim Tebow,
I can’t get no fucking sleep.

149
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,677
The world is on fire and I’m too tired
to put this shit out.

150
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,930
Jesus, turn that fucking music down.’"

151
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,813
She-She’s a Jehovah’s Witness.
My grandmother’s a Jehovah’s Witness.

152
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,022
Yeah, I know. I know.

153
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,252
If you think it’s messed up when they pop
up at your house at 8:00 in the morning,

154
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:55,321
it’s worse when they pop up at
your hospital bed and your femur’s broke.

155
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,906
You can’t run from ’em.

156
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,785
You can’t curse ’em out.
Can’t slam the door on their face.

157
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,788
Them fucking <i>Watchtower</i> magazines
start piling up.

158
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,460
She come to my hospital room,
I’m pretending I’m back in a coma.

159
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,469
"He’s moving." "No, I’m not."

160
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,139
In a fucking coma.

161
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,436
Then she starts singing
them Negro spirituals.

162
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,484
Even at home, she’s singing this shit.

163
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,580
I said, "Grandma, stop it.

164
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,498
You’re not in a field picking cotton.

165
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,211
You’re at home in your kitchen
making grilled cheese sandwiches

166
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,796
for your grandkids."

167
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,344
’Cause she was a Civil Rights activist.

168
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,138
One time, she even marched 30 miles

169
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,890
just to sit in a restaurant

170
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,643
and eat lunch with white people
that hated her black ass.

171
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,146
So you know there was nothing I could do
about getting her out of my hospital room.

172
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,065
Nothin’.

173
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,487
But it’s good to have relatives around you
when you’re convalescing like that,

174
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,239
’cause they give you the strength
and the motivation to get better.

175
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,575
Just so you get the fuck away
from their ass again.

176
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,412
Y’all know your motivation
when you first left home.

177
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:29,183
"I got to get the fuck away
from y’all crazy motherfuckers.

178
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,501
I’ll do this on
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

179
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,253
but I ain’t gonna do this
on a day-to-day basis. No!"

180
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,050
The one I feared the most
to come seeing me

181
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,593
was my Aunt Flossie.

182
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,096
’Cause she didn’t come see me
’cause she cared about me.

183
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,349
She just wanted to be in the middle
of some family bullshit.

184
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,936
She’s that aunt that’s always
in the middle of some family bullshit.

185
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,459
I knew she was in the hospital
before she even came to my room

186
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,999
’cause I heard her voice
in the waiting room.

187
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,858
"Who you calling a nigga?"

188
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:05,910
She was the most judgmental,
mean-spirited person I know.

189
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,788
Like, she would sit in a chair
in the corner of my hospital room

190
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,457
and judge everybody that came in the room
to see me.

191
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,126
"Who the fuck is this bitch...

192
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,171
with these nylon stockings on
and this tight dress?"

193
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,007
"Flossie, that’s my nurse."

194
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,971
"So? So? She look like
a fucking chickenhead to me.

195
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,764
Cluck, cluck.

196
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,394
She ain’t got to be rubbin’ on you.

197
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,398
Rubbin’ your arm up and down,
saying everything is gonna be all right.

198
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,110
Touchin’ on you. You a married man, Tracy.

199
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,403
She a ho.

200
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,947
She put the ‘ho’ in ho-spital."

201
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,621
Just judgmental.

202
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,167
My grandmother is 84 years old now.

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,171
When she was 72,
she went back and got her GED.

204
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,798
And we were so proud of her.

205
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,176
We were so proud.

206
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,471
We threw a party for her and everything.
A big party with the family.

207
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,348
She’s sittin’ in the corner,
"That bitch still stupid."

208
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,269
"That’s your mother, Flossie."

209
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,729
"So? So?

210
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,856
Is she gonna go to college now?

211
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,233
How’s she gonna get there,
the Underground Railroad?"

212
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:23,488
She’s just mean-spirited.

213
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,073
Nobody in my family’s like that.

214
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,742
She’s even mean to her husband, Bobby.

215
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,702
Bobby’s my favorite uncle.
He’s a good man.

216
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,372
He’s a butcher.
He just can’t read and write.

217
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,874
You know how she introduce him to people?

218
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,794
"Hi, this is my husband, Bobby.
He limited."

219
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:55,728
Just to fuck with him,
she would do sick shit, like on Christmas,

220
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:59,649
she’d make him put the kids’ toys together
knowing he can’t read the instructions.

221
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,447
She’d go, "Hey, Bobby,
put the kids’ toys together.

222
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,949
Watch this."

223
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,079
Bobby’s sitting there
with the instructions struggling.

224
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,251
It was like watching a retarded person
be executed.

225
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:23,339
As they strap ’em down to the gurney,
he’d pop up and go, "See you tomorrow."

226
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,355
She was just too much.

227
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:41,607
But she had three older brothers.

228
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,317
My oldest uncle name is Marvin.

229
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,081
We called him Uncle Jailbird
’cause I didn’t know this motherfucker.

230
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,322
My whole life, he was in prison.

231
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,493
His last conviction,

232
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:56,080
he got arrested for stealing
some kid’s iPod at a bus stop.

233
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,790
It wasn’t even an iPhone.

234
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,961
The judge gave him three extra years
for stealing outdated technology.

235
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,172
Stupid motherfucker.

236
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,842
His first conviction,

237
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:11,345
he got arrested for trying to sell
stolen cold cuts to prostitutes

238
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,723
at a truck stop
on the New Jersey Turnpike.

239
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:20,480
He roll up on a truck and go,
"What can I get for a turkey sandwich?"

240
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,815
"Shit, I ain’t sucking your dick
for no lunch meat."

241
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,320
But selling all that pussy,
you get hungry.

242
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,448
Before you know it, there was
a line of prostitutes outside his truck.

243
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,825
"Can I get a salami sandwich?"

244
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,328
He roll the window down and go,
"I knew you’d be back.

245
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,955
I knew you bitches be back."

246
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,334
The pimps ratted him out.

247
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,337
The prostitutes was too bloated
to sell pussy,

248
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,631
from all the sodium from the cold cuts.

249
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,817
They ratted his ass out.
"We gotta get him outta here.

250
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,135
Get him outta this parking lot.
He got to go.

251
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,263
This is a truck stop, goddamn it.
We sell good pussy here.

252
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,434
These girls work hard, goddamn it."

253
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,439
At his sentencing, a judge asked him,

254
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:07,527
"Where did you get the idea
to sell stolen cold cuts to prostitutes

255
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,946
at a truck stop
on the New Jersey Turnpike?"

256
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,074
This fool looks at the judge and go,
"Hos gotta eat too."

257
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,041
But he was nervous for Flossie.

258
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:26,045
One time Flossie went to visit him
on a visit, and he was real nervous.

259
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:29,465
He’s sittin’ there in the visiting room
trying to make small talk with her.

260
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,759
Saying shit like...

261
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,386
"Thank God today’s Friday, right?"

262
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,014
She said, "In prison, every day is Friday
for you, motherfucker.

263
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,226
There ain’t no Mondays or Tuesdays.

264
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,728
There’s just days where you get
fucked in the ass,

265
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,355
and days where you don’t."

266
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,944
He start yelling at the guard,
"Get me the fuck outta here!

267
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,362
This is abuse!"

268
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,948
And on the way walking back to his cell
she yelled out,

269
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,410
"You better hope today’s your lucky day
and you’re on top, motherfucker."

270
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,498
My family’s crazy.

271
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,128
Everybody in here got that dark side
of their family they don’t fuck with.

272
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:11,132
She’s shakin’ her head.
Yup, everybody here got a dark side.

273
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,260
They’re pieces of shit.
They’re just related to you.

274
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,598
Y’all know who the fuck I’m talking about.

275
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,558
Y’all on your way to the house
on Thanksgiving,

276
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,436
and your father’s driving the car
and y’all in the backseat.

277
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,897
And he’s turning around to go,
"We’re only staying for a half hour."

278
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,442
Them motherfuckers.

279
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,698
Y’all get there. Tryin’ to have
a nice dinner, and their house is filthy.

280
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,826
Y’all eatin’ turkey
and a roach crawl on the wall,

281
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:42,204
and your father go, "Goddamn it! Let’s go.

282
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,624
These motherfuckers are savages.

283
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,377
It smell like German shepherd
and ass in here.

284
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,091
I wouldn’t drink bottled water
with these motherfuckers.

285
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,594
And this chicken ain’t all the way dead.

286
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,764
Let’s fucking go."

287
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,060
It’s worse when they come to your house.

288
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,282
12:00 at night, one of your
fucking cousins is knockin’ on the door.

289
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,692
Your mother go to the door
with that nasty-ass nightgown on

290
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,945
that got a rip right here
and you can see half her areola.

291
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,867
Big ass areola. Look like
she dipped her titty in chocolate.

292
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,079
"Who is it?"

293
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,499
"It’s me, Jimmy."

294
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:30,461
"It’s Jimmy. It’s Jimmy.
It’s Jimmy. It’s Jimmy."

295
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,714
Your father
a big funky looking motherfucker.

296
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,675
Got on these dingy-ass Fruit of the Looms.

297
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:40,096
And he had surgery on his knee,
so he got that big knee brace on.

298
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,640
And he get up and go to the door
with a limp.

299
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,974
"Goddamn it, Jimmy.

300
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,897
You stole my fucking TV.

301
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,733
That was a nice 27-inch Zenith.

302
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,027
Call the police. Call the police."

303
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,948
That’s family.

304
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,036
My family is fucking bugged.

305
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,621
My family crazy.

306
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,958
My family is crazy.

307
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,751
I got a big family.

308
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,462
And at the front of the family
is a lot of elderly people,

309
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,964
and they’re startin’ to die off.

310
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,149
And ’cause of my settlement,

311
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,333
they think I’m supposed to pay
for everybody’s funeral.

312
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,803
And that shit get expensive.

313
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,305
I had to sit them motherfuckers down
and go, "Wait a minute.

314
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,516
Some of you niggas
gonna have to be cremated.

315
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,228
And that’s without a box.

316
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,106
Just slide your ass in like some pizza.

317
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,364
If you want to go in the ground,
I’ll buy one huge-ass coffin

318
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,907
and rent a deep freezer,

319
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,077
and whoever die that year,
every December goes in the ground.

320
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:48,456
And if you don’t like it,
I’ll put fire to your ass.

321
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,418
Hey, I understand
the whole Black Lives Matter,

322
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,961
but you niggas would be dead.

323
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,755
And you niggas won’t matter."

324
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,099
They crazy.

325
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,771
I got a bunch of aunts
that had babies by deadbeat motherfuckers.

326
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,439
All them fucking kids.

327
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,859
And they think I’m supposed to
put all their kids in fucking college.

328
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,320
You fucked for ’em. You made ’em.

329
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,863
You pay their tuition.

330
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,532
I’m all for higher learning.

331
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:26,577
But this is not
the United Niggas College Fund.

332
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:32,541
If the motherfucker can’t play basketball
or run a 4.3 in a 40, he’s fucked.

333
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:37,505
Don’t be mad. UPS is hiring.

334
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,514
When I came out the coma, I got deep.

335
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,766
I wanted to learn who I was,
where I’m from.

336
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,228
So I went online
and got that ancestry.com shit.

337
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,191
The results just came back last week.
You know, the chart says

338
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:01,946
25% Native American, 25% African American,
10% Irish.

339
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,114
My whole chart just said
"Nigga from Brooklyn."

340
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,081
Hey.

341
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,000
I come from a long line
of niggas from Brooklyn.

342
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,336
I’m from the projects.

343
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,564
For all you white people here
that don’t know what that is,

344
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,590
you remember that movie <i>The Lion King?</i>

345
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,176
When Mufasa was talking to Simba,
and he said,

346
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,887
"Everything the light touches
belongs to us."

347
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,532
And Simba said, "What’s that dark area?"

348
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,599
He said, "That’s the projects, nigga.

349
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,979
You don’t go over there, motherfucker.
Keep your ass over here on Pride Rock.

350
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,480
You understand me?

351
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,608
That’s where the pit bulls
and Latin Kings be.

352
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,277
Your Uncle Scar’s a Latin King.

353
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,445
That’s how he got that cut on his head.

354
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,406
Keep your ass over here on Pride Rock."

355
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,703
I’m from the ghetto, man.
The ghetto’s crazy.

356
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,454
The ghetto’s crazy.

357
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,832
Motherfuckers don’t even
have normal names there no more.

358
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,293
Ever since that Five-Percent
of religion came,

359
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:01,589
motherfuckers changed their names to names
that don’t even fit their personality.

360
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,925
Like I know a dude named Knowledge,
don’t know shit.

361
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,181
Motherfucker named Universe
who never left the neighborhood.

362
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,770
I know one motherfucker named Unique,
got an identical twin brother.

363
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,316
Crazy motherfucker.

364
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,206
When I was in the hospital, all my friends
from Brooklyn called me, man.

365
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,792
Well, Jay Z called me.

366
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:41,295
- Chris Rock called me.
- We love you, Tracy!

367
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,378
And I love you too.

368
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,964
Let me see your titty now.

369
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:50,137
Like I was saying, all my friends
from Brooklyn called, you know?

370
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:53,974
All my friends from Brooklyn called.
Jay Z called. Chris Rock called.

371
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,393
Eddie Murphy called. Mike Tyson called.

372
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,229
Yeah, Mike. Mike called me.
He said, "Tracy."

373
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,192
I said, "Who the fuck is this?"
He said, "Me, Mike Tyson.

374
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,779
When you come home from the hospital,
I’m gonna come visit you.

375
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:10,324
We can fly pigeons
and get matching face tattoos."

376
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,785
I said, "No, you’re not coming
to my house, Mike.

377
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,456
My brain is already messed up.
I don’t need your crazy rubbin’ off on me.

378
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,542
I got hit by a truck, nigga.
I ain’t stupid."

379
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,733
When I came out of the coma,
I was behaving erratically.

380
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:29,426
I was acting really erratically.
And the doctors told my wife,

381
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,178
"Mrs. Morgan, that’s the brain trauma."

382
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,263
And my wife looked at the doctors
and said, "Nah.

383
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,643
Nah.

384
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,688
That nigga always been crazy."

385
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:52,074
"I was hoping the accident
was going to fix his crazy brain."

386
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,412
Like an old TV where you can’t get
the picture to work. Goddamn, come on.

387
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,288
Archie Bunker’s comin’ on.

389

My brain was really messed up, man.
It was really messed up, man.

390
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:10,759
I remember coming out of the coma,
had this Donna Summer song in my head.

391
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:14,221
For some reason, I got
this Donna Summer song in my head, man.

392
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,384
But I couldn’t remember the words.
All day, just singing this fucking Donna...

393
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,437
♪ <i>On the radio</i> ♪

394

396
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,659
I couldn’t remember the words
and it scared the shit out of me.

397
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,371
I said to myself, if I can’t remember
the words to this, or simple shit,

398
00:25:39,455 --> 00:25:41,832
they ain’t gonna never
let me out of this hospital.

399
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:42,915

And then it dawned on me.

402
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,303
I never knew the fucking words
to the song!

403
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,861
I don’t think Donna Summer knew the words
to the song, and she wrote the song.

404
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,872
I tell you though, man,

405
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,292
when I was in the hospital,
I masturbated constantly.

406
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,129
That’s all I did all day long
was beat on this dick.

407
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:33,383
That was the only part of my body
that worked.

408
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,428
This dick got beat upon.

409
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,723
I beat this dick like he owed me money.

410
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,810
Give me my shit back.

411
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,523
My dick put a restraining order out
on my right hand.

412
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,737
I tore my rotator cuff on my left arm
beatin’ on this dick.

413
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,948
Had to get Tommy John surgery.

414
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,952
One day, the heart machine went off.
The nurses came running in.

415
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,763
I was in there beatin’ off.

416
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,873
They said somebody need to teach
that motherfucker solitaire or something.

417
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,960
Crossword puzzles or something.

418
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,006
I did physical therapy.

419
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,219
Did physical therapy.
I kept my physical therapist close to me.

420
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,681
’Cause me and my wife planned on
getting married when things settled.

421
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,809
I wanted to walk my wife down the aisle.

422
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,895
Without a crutch. Without a cane.

423
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,067
So I kept her near me. But when she came
to my house for the first time,

424
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:36,488
the physical therapist,
I opened the door and I was like, "Whoa."

425
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,782
This white woman was 6’1".

426
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:43,787
Blue eyes, blonde hair. And I never seen
a white woman with a booty like this.

427
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:48,125
Yeah. Huge, nice, fat, small waist.

428
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:51,378
Look like she swallowed
a young black girl from Harlem.

429
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,421
Damn.

430
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,633
An amazon. Can I get my on?

431
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,430
Ah, man, she was beautiful.
I mean, I remember one time...

432
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:05,517
one time she bent over in front of me,
I seen, like, five inches of butt crack.

433
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,936
And it was beautiful.
It was like watching a sunset.

434
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,360
I felt like I should’ve been laying in
a hammock,

435
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,112
sippin’ on a piña colada.

436
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,239
Beautiful sight to behold.

437
00:28:20,324 --> 00:28:24,369
Beautiful butt. It would inspire
young black males to stay in school.

438
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,708
One day I had a wardrobe malfunction
and my dick had popped out.

439
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,085
And the mouth on my dick
was grinning at her.

440
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,592
Then it started singing to her.

441

00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,246
This woman really worked me out.

444
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,022
She was dedicated to gettin’ me
on my feet.

445
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,442
She worked me out sittin’ between my legs
and stretching me out.

446
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,361
And rubbed my muscles
and relaxed my muscles.

447
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,363
And I would look at her.

448
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,281
And I started to fall in love with her.

449
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,618
I started to have feelings for her.

450
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,537
But it wasn’t true.
It was just a syndrome.

451
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,421
It’s called
the Florence Nightingale syndrome.

452
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:13,543
True story. Florence Nightingale was
a nurse in the Crimean War in the 1800s.

453
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,772
She would nurse all the wounded soldiers
back together,

454
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,339
and they would fall in love with her.

455
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,423
And that happened to me.

456
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,259
And then one day my wife saw that shit.

457
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,052
She said, "What the fuck is going on?

458
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,932
And why is your dick singing
‘On the Radio’ to her?"

459
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:33,105
I said, "No, baby. I’m sorry.

460
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,315
I’m sorry. I don’t love her. I love you.

461
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,025
I didn’t mean it. I love you.

462
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,112
It’s just a syndrome. It’s called
the Florence Nightingale syndrome."

463
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,615
She said, "Yeah, motherfucker, guess what.
I got a syndrome too.

464
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,326
It’s called the Big Dick Mailman syndrome.

465
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,622
And
the Pussy-eatin’ Pool Cleaner syndrome."

466
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,000
I said, "You have dual syndromes?

467
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,668
Can I watch?"

468
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,385
My speech therapist was a good woman.
She helped me out, helped my life out.

469
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,220
You know, I kept her close to me because

470
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,557
I wanted to recite the vows
to my wife at our wedding correctly.

471
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,019
I wanted to say "I do,"
and not "Fuck you."

472
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,109
So she worked really closely with me.

473
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:24,281
And because of the brain trauma, some
days were dark, and some days were okay.

474
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,244
I remember one day,
she came over on a dark day,

475
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,910
and she said,
"Mr. Morgan, I would like for you

476
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,829
to repeat after me, okay?

477
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:35,208
Say, ‘The man is on the corner.’ Okay?
Say that.

478
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,920
‘The man is on the corner.’"

479
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,048
And I said, "The man is on the corner."

480
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:42,799
She said, "No. Say, ‘The man’"...

481
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,676
I said, "Bitch, that’s how I talk.

482
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:47,639
Everybody can see that man
on the fucking corner.

483
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,140
Don’t talk to me
about that fucking man on the corner.

484
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:53,560
He got a green jacket? That’s
my Uncle Marvin on that fucking corner.

485
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,480
He’s selling stolen cold cuts
on that fucking corner."

486
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:59,232
And she see that she hurt me.

487
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,110
She said, "Mr. Morgan, are you okay?"
I said, "I’m a’ight."

488
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,403
She said, "No, say, I’m"...

489
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:05,864
I said,
"Bitch, I told you that’s how I talk."

490
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,034
Then I see that I hurt her.

491
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,243
And I said, "Are you okay?"

492
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,037
She said, "I’m a’ight."

493
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,247
I said,
"This bitch playing with my head now.

494
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,352
She trying to get in my head
and live rent free, goddamn it.

495
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,627
Okay, you win.

496
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,545
The man is on the corner."

497
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,559
You know what was cool?
When I was in my wheelchair.

498
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:39,314
My daughter was 14 months old,
and I got to see her take her first steps.

499
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:41,608
And that right there...

500
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,691
Yeah, thank you.

501
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,277
I got to see that.

502
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,279
That’s important to a man.

503
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,450
That inspired me to get out of
my wheelchair, and I took my first steps.

504
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,286
So now, me and my daughter
walk hand in hand for life.

505
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,622
’Cause we learned how to walk
at the same time.

506
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,040
That’s magic.

507
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,458
Magic.

508
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,001
I’ll never forget it.

509
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,588
I remember,
one night me and my wife, Megan,

510
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:05,674
we saw her running down the hallway,

511
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,968
for the first time
in her shitty doo-doo Pamper.

512
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,471
I started running down the hallway
in my shitty doo-doo Pamper,

513
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:12,848
tryin’ to catch her little ass.

514
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:13,932
"Come here, goddamn it."

515
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,400
Then it got competitive
with me and my daughter.

516
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,087
One day I seen her breast-feeding
with my wife.

517
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,321
I said,
"Damn, she suck titty better than me."

518
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,659
I took her technique
because I love me some titty milk.

519
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,078
Titty milk and Splenda.

520
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,414
I gotta watch my carbs, you know?

521
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,252
Ben & Jerry’s should make that
a new flavor.

522
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,380
Could I get two scoops of Titty Milk
and Splenda?

523
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,090
No, just put it in a little cup.

524
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,594
I don’t want a waffle cone. Just a little
cup. Titty Milk and Splenda. Thank you.

525
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,221
Thank you very much.

526
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,183
I miss y’all.

527
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,018
I miss doing this.

528
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,521
I really miss y’all. I love you.

529
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,983
Whoa, it was... scary.

530
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,195
I knew when I was ready to come back.

531
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:12,407
’Cause my wife, my rock,
stopped pitying me.

532
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,867
That’s when I knew.

533
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,912
’Cause when the accident happened,
you know, I got depressed,

534
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,748
you know, watching my friends,
like Tina Fey, Kevin Hart,

535
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,625
all those people doing what I love to do.

536
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,793
I started eating a lot of comfort food.

537
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:25,670
And I put on a lot of pounds.

538
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,194
And then one day my wife
just got fed up and was looking at me

539
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,925
laying on the couch like a beached whale.

540
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,343
With disgust.

541
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,347
It was like she was counting
the stretch marks, you know?

542
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,201
And she said,
"Why don’t you get off the couch

543
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,227
and go to the comedy club
and do some comedy,

544
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,063
you big-gut, shitty,
Pamper-wearin’ motherfucker?"

545
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,193
And I jumped up and said, "I’m back!"

546
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:51,863
Whoo!

547
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,118
Whoo!

548
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,914
’Cause let me tell you something, man.

549
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,916
Let me tell you guys something.

550
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,894
You’re nothing.
I don’t care who you think you are,

551
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:08,588
how special you think you are,
how much money and pretty and looks.

552
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:10,507
You nothing without your health.

553
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,009
Take it from me, man.

554
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:14,803
Let’s not take it for granted.

555
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,264
You gotta take care of yourself,
know what I’m saying?

556
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:21,017
Look at Tiger Woods,
the greatest golfer in the world.

557
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:24,145
Four back surgeries later,
he’s just a normal nigga like me.

558
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,984
I mean,
the blackest thing Tiger Woods ever did

559
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,652
was suck at golf.

560
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,781
Y’all can handle the nigga now.

561
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,246
I just can’t believe, like, at the height
of his career he denied being black.

562
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:45,041
I’m like,
"Tiger, your dad’s name is Earl Woods."

563
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,796
"Every Earl Woods I know is black.

564
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,007
And he drive a white van.

565
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,509
He sell fish out the back of that van.

566
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,845
And he’s fucking my aunt.

567
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,265
Tiger, you got two little half brothers
up in Harlem.

568
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,766
You need to go see ’em.

569
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,935
Rodney and Darius."

570
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:14,029
Tiger Woods went downhill
when he started cheatin’ on his wife.

571
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,573
Only little boys do that.

572
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,285
You got a good rider,
a good woman with you by your side,

573
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,828
you don’t cheat on her.

574
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:25,290
You got a good woman by your side.
And what I’m saying in essence, fellas,

575
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,334
don’t go chasing waterfalls.

576
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:31,379
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes
you’re used to.

577
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:37,993
Chasing them young girls out there.

578
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:40,597
One of them young girls
gonna give you herpes in your mouth.

579
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,225
And everybody at CVS
know what that cream is for.

580
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:51,441
You don’t wanna be that dude in your 50s
sittin’ in that free clinic

581
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,193
with them young motherfuckers.

582
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,528
Just sittin’ there.

583
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,447
"Excuse me. Are you the doctor?"

584
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,616
"No, I got clap. I’m next."

585
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,202
"What is clap?"

586
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,745
"Old school VD."

587
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,084
"After we get our shots, could you buy
me and my friends a case of beer?"

588
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,877
"You gonna get me some young bitches?"

589
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,508
That’s arrested development.
You gotta grow the fuck up.

590
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,467
Yeah!

591
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,635
You do!

592
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:24,307
Can’t keep doing the shit
you were doing when you was 18.

593
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,560
I was watching <i>Couples Therapy</i>
the other day.

594
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,604
They have Flavor Flav on there.

595
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,775
Flavor Flav is 62 years old.

596
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:37,862
I’m not calling no 62-year-old man
Flavor Flav.

597
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,700
What is your real name? Derek?

598
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,248
And take that clock off, goddamn it.

599
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,670
Arrested development.

600
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,632
He had a hat on to the side
with reading glasses on.

601
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,634
When you have reading glasses on,

602
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,637
it’s time to turn the brim around
to the front

603
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:05,140
and become a real Padres fan.

604
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,436
And put a belt on, goddamn it.

605
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,939
Them young sags out there.

606
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,252
That’s why I don’t go
to strip clubs no more.

607
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,736
That’s arrested development.

608
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,696
I don’t go to strip clubs no more.

609
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,299
I just got tired of fighting
with them bitches

610
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,868
on how many songs I paid for
on the lap dance.

611
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,454
I said three songs.

612
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,247
Mixtapes don’t count.

613
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,669
I just got tired of them bitches
recognizing me in the street

614
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,254
while I’m with my wife and kids.

615
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,339
"Hi, Tracy.

616
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,884
It’s me Janet, aka Cinnamon."

617
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,969
"Damn it, Cinnamon!
I said don’t talk to me

618
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:45,054
unless we’re in the Boom Boom Room."

619
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,394
You don’t want to be the old man
bringing flowers on Valentine’s Day.

620
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:53,164
At the strip club.
You don’t want to be that.

621
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,064
"Hi, Cinnamon. These are for you."

622
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:58,485
"Oh, these are so nice. Could you
set these in that water over there

623
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:01,946
while I lap-dance this guy
till he comes in his pants?"

624
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,578
Arrested development.
Women, y’all got arrested development too.

625
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,623
Me and my wife went to a wedding
two weeks ago.

626
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,250
And when you get to a certain age,
this is dancing.

627
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:15,710
Two-steppin’.

628
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,337
That’s all you gotta do...

629
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,923
is one move.

630
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,008
Stomach out. Stomach in.

631
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,803
Stomach out. Stomach in.

632
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,347
Stomach out. Stomach in.

633
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,682
Stomach out. Stomach in.

634
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,185
Stomach out. Stomach in.

635
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,270
That’s all you gotta do.

636
00:38:34,354 --> 00:38:36,439
We was dancing next to
this 50-year-old woman,

637
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,067
and this bitch start doing
all this Ciara shit.

638
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,694
And I was still smiling.
But in my mind, I was saying,

639
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:43,363
"If this bitch kick me in the femur...

640
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,785
I’m gonna knock her the fuck out."

641
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,540
Just keep the beat, you big bitch.

642
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,502
Arrested development.

643
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,172
Madonna has arrested development too.

644
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,467
You seen all the plastic surgeries
she had trying to look like a young girl?

645
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,012
I like saggy mom titties.

646
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,390
I like that.

647
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,351
You breast-fed two kids with them titties.

648
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,895
They’ve earned the right to relax.

649
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:24,571
Titties all the way down
by her C-section scar.

650
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,283
The nipples and pussy is this far away.

651
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,869
As far as I’m concerned,

652
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,831
ain’t nothing better than eating pussy
and sucking titties at the same time.

653
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,341
Women, don’t be ashamed of your bodies.

654
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,677
Don’t be ashamed.

655
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,140
My first love was 300 pounds.

656
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,894
In the ghetto.
And that was Big Mertis. 300 pounds.

657
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:57,687
That was my baby girl.

658
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,566
Me and her go back to the fourth grade.
She was 250 then.

659
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,988
I loved Big Mertis. She was
the first girl I ever fucked naked.

660
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,675
You know?
’Cause when you’re in high school,

661
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,993
you pull your pants down to your knees
when you fuck...

662
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,013
in case somebody coming up the stairs.

663
00:40:14,037 --> 00:40:15,496
You can pull your shit back up.

664
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,918
She let me fuck her naked.

665
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,604
’Cause her mother worked at night.

666
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,668
So I would go up there
and fuck her for ten minutes,

667
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,341
then sleep for two hours,
just like I do now.

668
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,267
I remember one time,
I was tearing that pussy up.

669
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,771
And she said, "Tracy, I want you
to pick me up and fuck me on the wall."

670
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,648
I said, "Bitch, you’re 300 pounds.

671
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,277
You know I got that scoliosis in my spine.

672
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,447
You gotta pick me up
and fuck me on the wall."

673
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,991
And she did!

674
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,662
She fucked the shit out of me on the wall.

675
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,581
And she cured my scoliosis.

676
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,501
Thank God it was a weight-bearing wall.

677
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,799
That was my baby girl. She broke my heart.

678
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:11,177
Broke my heart. Shattered my shit.

679
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,472
’Cause I didn’t know
everybody in the hood was fucking her.

680
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,809
Everybody was fucking her.
I found that out the hard way.

681
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,144
One time I had her doggy style,
tearin’ up...

682
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:23,314
"Who pussy is this? Who pussy is this?"

683
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,651
And she turned around and said,
"You mean right now?

684
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,923
Well, it’s yours right now,
but in ten minutes when Derek comes,

685
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:32,323
it’s gonna be his.

686
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,702
But go ahead and knock yourself out.
Goddamn it, knock yourself out.

687
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,954
Go knock yourself out."

688
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,541
Pattin’ that booty.
"Go and knock yourself out."

689
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,380
I love everything about a woman’s body.

690
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,966
I donk everything. I love everything.

691
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,302
I like making love to women
who got C-section scars.

692
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,114
And I ain’t talking about
that little slit there.

693
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,848
I’m talking about the old-school shit.

694
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:01,728
Old school. Her stomach look like
that cut on Frankenstein’s forehead.

695
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,439
"Friend."

696
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,781
Just got married.

697
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,701
Just got married again.

698
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,929
This is my second marriage.
This one gotta work.

699
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,705
I fucked that first marriage up.

700
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,623
I fucked it up.

701
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:23,958
This one gotta work.

702
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,753
Know how much alimony and child support
that’d be.

703
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:29,380
I would have to get hit
by a second Walmart truck.

704
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,092
And a Doritos truck.

705
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:35,553
And a FedEx plane.

706
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,515
Heard you could make
a quiet 20 million off a FedEx plane.

707
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,769
If you survive with all your faculties
and limbs and shit.

708
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:45,563
That’d be messed up
if you was just a torso and a head.

709
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,275
Your friend carry you around
in a Gucci bag on his back.

710
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,571
"Yo, take me to the beach, man.
Put me where the bitches be.

711
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,950
If it get too hot, I’m gonna go, ‘Ooh!’
That mean come get me."

712
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,330
You’re just a torso with a chinchilla on.

713
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:13,174
Y’all will know if I ever go broke.
Y’all hear about me.

714
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:16,594
Ridin’ on the turnpike,
dressed in all black on a ten-speed.

715
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,389
"There goes that news van again."

716
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,519
I fucked that first marriage up, man.

717
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,145
I fucked it up, man.

718
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:27,688
Just too much drinking.

719
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,148
Too much drinking.

720
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,109
I remember my first DUI.

721
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:34,570
The cop gave me a line test
and I kept stepping on his shoe.

722
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:36,781
And I said,
"Move your foot, motherfucker!"

723
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,993
He didn’t think that was funny.
He took my black ass to jail.

724
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,539
My second DUI,
they didn’t even give me a Breathalyzer.

725
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,208
I just sat in the backseat
my goddamn self.

726
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:49,168
I know how much I drank.

727
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,587
I had two Long Island Iced Teas
and three Incredible Hulks.

728
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:52,797
Let’s go.

729
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,885
I read myself my own Miranda rights.
You have the right to remain...

730
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,428
Then I waived them.

731
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,141
Then I beat the shit out of myself
just for being black.

732
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,023
They made me go to AA meetings.
That shit was depressing.

733
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,377
One motherfucker stood up at the meeting
and said,

734
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,903
"Alcohol made me burn my house down."

735
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:18,906
Another fucker stood up and said,
"Alcohol made me want to kill myself."

736
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,076
I stood up and said,
"You motherfuckers are a bunch of liars.

737
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,370
That wasn’t alcohol. That was crack."

738
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:28,457
Alcohol don’t do that to you.
When I’m drunk at the club,

739
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,544
all I wanna do is pull my dick out
on the dance floor and sing.

740
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:36,382
♪ <i>She came from somewhere back</i>
<i>In her long ago</i> ♪

741
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:42,430
♪ <i>She had a place in his life</i> ♪

742
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,351
They made me do community service.

743
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:50,354
But the fucked-up thing about that,
nobody wanted me in their community.

744
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,733
They want to see you on TV.

745
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,027
Don’t want to see your black ass
in nobody’s backyard...

746
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,653
peein’ in their shrubs.

747
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:01,449
"Who’s that in Jim’s backyard
peeing in the shrubs drinkin’ a 40?"

748
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:04,327
"That’s Tracy Morgan
from <i>Saturday Night Live."</i>

749
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,663
"If the nigga pee in these shrubs,

750
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:10,583
that’s gonna be Tracy Morgan
from <i>Saturday Night Dead."</i>

751
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:15,546
My wife is strong. She’s a strong woman.

752
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,049
She showed me her strength. She’s strong.

753
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:20,051
As a woman, you would have to be strong

754
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,970
to have a motherfucker
with a face like this on top of you.

755
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,564
I look like a cross between Wesley Snipes
and Biz Markie.

756
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:44,116
I remember the first time
I had sex with my wife after the accident.

757
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,576
I came hard.

758
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,913
I mean, I came hard. Like in high school.

759
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:52,792
I came hard.

760
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,462
Remember in high school,
you’d come hard and shit?

761
00:45:58,506 --> 00:46:00,216
I had a William Tell dick.

762
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,593
I could knock an apple off your head
from right here.

763
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,434
Remember in high school, your dick
got hard... that high school hard-on?

764
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,603
You could break brick with that dick,
goddamn it.

765
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:17,358
But when you get in your 40s and 50s,
you’re playing semipro now.

766
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:23,280
She gotta suck your dick for two hours
just to get you semi-hard.

767
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,492
Her nose start bleeding, mascara running.

768
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:30,246
She gotta dislocate her jaw
like a boa constrictor.

769
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,335
"You need help."

770
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,091
And, ladies, when you’re making love,
spit on his dick. Spit on it.

771
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,594
Spit on that dick.
I love when a woman spit on my...

772
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:47,263
Spit on it like you hate it.

773
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,225
Call it a racial slur.
"You Czechoslovakian son of a"...

774
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,143
Goddamn it.

775
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,812
Spit on that fuckin’ dick.

776
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:57,064
"You Ecuadorean mother"...

777
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,568
"You Mexican immigrant <i>puto"...</i>

778
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,737
Please, spit on that dick, goddamn it.

779
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:05,114
Spit on that fucking dick.

780
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:12,580
I’m an older man now. So being intimate
with my wife now, you know,

781
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,081
is different, you know.

782
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,792
Before sex,
I gotta pull out a black tool bag.

783
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,713
Inside the bag is a Zorro mask...

784
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:24,967
a vibrator, some spare batteries
and an apology letter.

785
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,013
"What’s the apology letter for?"

786
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,096
"You’ll see.

787
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,390
You’ll see."

788
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:42,068
I don’t care who you are here.
If you’re a couple, keep fucking.

789
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:44,278
You got to. Keep your relationship hot.

790
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,590
’Cause if y’all live together
and y’all not fucking no more,

791
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:48,074
y’all are nothing but roommates.

792
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,554
Don’t let her start that headache shit.
’Cause they always start with that.

793
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,412
"I got a headache."

794
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,433
"Yeah, well, you’re gonna have a headache
with this dick up in you, goddamn it.

795
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,794
I drive that truck all week.
I spend good money in here, goddamn it."

796
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,171
Fuck all that headache shit.

797
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,424
"You need a Bufferin, goddamn it?

798
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,178
You need a Bufferin?"

799
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,764
You gotta keep it hot.

800
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,977
I don’t care if you’re 90 years old.
You stick that foreskin up in her.

801
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:20,439
I don’t care if you got one hump left.
Goddamn it, here.

802
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,113
With a bunch of foreskin.

803
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,532
Gotta keep it hot.

804
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:32,618
Foreplay is not just before sex.

805
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,079
Foreplay is all day long.

806
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,457
You let her know I’m still attracted
to your anatomy.

807
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,352
When she in the kitchen cooking
for you and the kids,

808
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,086
go in there and squeeze her booty.

809
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,879
"Go ahead now, Robert.

810
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,800
You see these damn kids here.
You better go ahead now."

811
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:51,512
When you’re driving in the car,
pull her titty out at a red light.

812
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:54,306
"You better stop it!
I’m not playing with you.

813
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:56,642
I ain’t playin’."

814
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,816
And, fellas, when you’re making love
to your wife, take your fucking socks off.

815
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,281
Ladies, if he don’t take his socks off,
that’s not love.

816
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,950
That’s just two ships passing
in the night.

817
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,126
My wife is 18 years younger than me.

818
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,837
Okay, my wife is 18 years younger than me.

819
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:30,259
Sometimes... Sometimes the age difference
can be a little difficult.

820
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:32,612
Like we had an argument the other night,
and I told her,

821
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:35,055
"Listen, I’m a 47-year-old man.

822
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,893
I’m not gonna sit here with you all night
and argue about Beyoncé."

823
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:44,940
She said, "But Beyoncé and Jay Z
is show business royalty."

824
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:48,277
I said, "Let me tell you something.
Jay Z just got hit by Solange.

825
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,070
I got hit by a Walmart truck."

826
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,995
I’m madly in love with her, man.
That’s my baby.

827
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,539
My wife. I’m madly in love with her, man.

828
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:03,500
But when you got a beautiful young wife
like that you’re married to,

829
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:04,853
and you’re madly in love with her,

830
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,379
it puts you at a disadvantage
in the relationship.

831
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:08,964
’Cause you ain’t gonna never leave.

832
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,217
You ain’t gonna never leave her. Never.

833
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,719
You talk your shit like you will,
but you ain’t.

834
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,095
And she know it.

835
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,115
I told my wife the other day,
"Let me tell you something.

836
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,058
You keep treating me the way you treat me,

837
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,351
one morning you gonna wake up,

838
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,354
and I’m gonna be sittin’ right there,
goddamn it.

839
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:26,982
That black medical bag
and your cappuccino.

840
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,026
Right there. I ain’t going nowhere.

841
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:30,109
I ain’t going nowhere."

842
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,073
They ain’t going nowhere.

843
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,785
My wife is beautiful.
She’s half white and half black.

844
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,913
There’s up sides to that
and down sides to that, you know?

845
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,291
’Cause she use the nigga word with me,
I don’t know what side called me a nigga.

846
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,172
If the black side of her
called me a nigga, cool.

847
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:54,301
But if the white side of her called me
a nigga, we got a fucking problem.

848
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,264
You gonna make me say, "Don’t call me
a nigga, you cracker bitch!

849
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,349
You honky whore."

850
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:09,709
’Cause when I’m fighting with my wife,
I hope I’m arguing with the white side,

851
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:13,404
’cause white women don’t curse you out
and insult your genitalia.

852
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:16,573
In an argument,
a white woman will listen to you...

853
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,534
and then she’ll huff,

854
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,745
and then she’ll walk to her room
and call her lawyer.

855
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,794
I mean, where you think that term
"irreconcilable differences" come from?

856
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,671
It didn’t come from a black woman.

857
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,132
For a black woman,
every difference is reconcilable,

858
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,426
long as she got a knife
and a fucking rolling pin.

859
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,683
’Cause we live in a very
affluent neighborhood now.

860
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,185
So when we argue...

861
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,982
we don’t yell no more because
there’s an echo in the suburbs.

862
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,860
And that shit reverberates
all the way around the block.

863
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,988
"Motherfucker! Motherfucker.
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.

864
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,490
Motherfucker. Motherfucker.
Motherfucker. Motherfucker...

865
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:01,076
Oh, shit! Somebody in our house."

866
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:04,663
But in the ghetto, ain’t no echo.

867
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,107
There’s just a bunch of motherfuckers
yelling at each other.

868
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:10,711
And if you think somebody in your house,
somebody’s in your house.

869
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,426
Now I forgave the driver.
I forgave that driver that hit me.

870
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:18,844
I’m not even mad at him.

871
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:22,306
But I’ll tell you who is mad at him.
All my white neighbors.

872
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:29,813
"Now if you ain’t never hit this nigga,
he wouldn’t be livin’ next to me!

873
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,357
I got daughters.

874
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,447
Group of biracial motherfuckers
runnin’ around here."

875
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,207
You know, God gave me a second chance.

876
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,625
And I wanted to do better.

877
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,461
I wanted to do better.

878
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,549
Especially on my marriage.
Like my wife, I love my wife.

879
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,675
She call me on my shit.

880
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,570
She said,
"Tracy, let me tell you something, man.

881
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,389
It’s all right to be an asshole,
but don’t become a piece of shit."

882
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,434
’Cause there is a difference between
an asshole and a piece of shit.

883
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:10,896
Asshole will ruin your summer.
Piece of shit will ruin your 20s.

884
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,982
Asshole will call you fat.

885
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,694
A piece of shit will sell your
diabetes medicine for Powerball tickets.

886
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,743
Just trying to control my emotions now.

887
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:26,829
When my wife yell at me,
I don’t yell back.

888
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,289
I just go to my side of the house
and I mutter.

889
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:33,001
Sometimes I fuck up
and I say the word "bitch" too loud.

890
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:36,171
Her black side heard that.
"Who the fuck is you calling a bitch?

891
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:39,174
You want this rolling pin
up aside your head again?"

892
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,512
Then I huff,
and I walk to my room and call my lawyer.

893
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,351
I’m a jealous guy, man.

894
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,478
I don’t mean to be with my wife,

895
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,605
but I’m probably gonna be jealous
in the afterlife.

896
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,525
In the afterlife...
I told my wife the other day,

897
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:59,528
you know, "If I should leave this earth
before you, God forbid...

898
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,823
you better sit on that pussy
for two years.

899
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,286
Show your damn love.
If you wanna go to other women, cool.

900
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:11,331
I’m a ghost. I’ll be haunting you.
I might want some girl-on-girl action.

901
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:16,462
But if you give it to another man,
I’m gonna put my ghost foot in his ass.

902
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,048
And if that don’t work, I’m gonna use a
cell phone or a candlestick, goddamn it."

903
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,384
I’m serious, man.

904
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,679
You give that shit up too soon,
you be ridin’ the next motherfucker,

905
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:27,514
and I’ll knock a picture off the wall.

906
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,683
"He’s here!"

907
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,226
"Who the fuck is here?

908
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:35,022
You better ride this dick, goddamn it.
I drive that truck all week.

909
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,024
I spend good money in here."

910
00:54:40,861 --> 00:54:43,780
Let me tell y’all something, man.
When it’s my time to go back to heaven,

911
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:44,990
I’m ready.

912
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,408
I won’t be scared.

913
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:47,868
I’m ready.

914
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,244
I’ll be all right.

915
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,038
I met God. He’s cool.

916
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,791
You know, he’s a hard ass,
but that’s only ’cause he’s Old Testament.

917
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,837
Old Testament.

918
00:54:58,921 --> 00:55:00,839
You know, Jesus was cool.

919
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:03,592
I was up there partying with Jesus.
He cool.

920
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:04,927
’Cause he New Testament.

921
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,346
You know what kind of guy Jesus is?

922
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:10,432
Jesus is that guy
that was always at the party

923
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,768
and he always brought the good reefer.

924
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,563
They didn’t call it weed yet.
They called it reefer.

925
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,942
And he’s the one that roll the spliffs
in the corner

926
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,486
on top of a Stevie Wonder album cover.

927
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,239
And the party’s poppin’ ’cause of him.

928
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,200
This is Jesus at the party
rollin’ the joints.

929
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,092
Who is it?

930
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,468
It’s Jimmy Mack.

931
00:55:46,552 --> 00:55:48,804
Let him in. He cool. That’s my man.
Let him in.

932
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:04,987
Who is it now?

933
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,530
It’s Tracy Morgan.

934
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,657
Nah, don’t let that nigga in. He’s crazy.

935
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,450
Send him back down.

936
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,928
Jesus!

937
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,682
Turn that shit down now!

938
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,058
That’s my pops.

939
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,185
Put on something mellow.

940
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,538
My name is Tracy Morgan. I love you.
Peace. I’m out.
