00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,880
A NETFLIX COMEDY SPECIAL

2
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,360
CASINO LEBANON

3
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello.

4
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,320
Wow, this is great!

5
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,080
This is great! Good evening.

6
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,040
Good evening!

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,000
God rest his soul!

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,880
Hello there. "Hello."

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,120
So bored! How are you all?

10
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,560
This is so cool. That much!

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,440
Hello up there. Good evening!

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,280
Yeah, I see you.

13
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,200
It's like you've arrived from outer space!

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,560
I want to say thank you for being here.

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,240
Thank you for traveling all the way
from Beirut to be here.

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
Quite a distance. I came on Thursday

17
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,680
so I wouldn't be late.
I usually don't travel for anyone.

18
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,720
See how important you are to me?
I came on Thursday.

19
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,280
Can I come down and kiss you all?

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,760
Will this make you late for anything
if I come down to kiss you all?

21
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,120
We love to kiss.

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,960
It's amazing how much we love it!
We Lebanese just adore kissing each other.

23
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,840
Is anyone here not Lebanese?

24
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,560
Yeah? Where are you from?

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,360
- Where are you from?
- Jordan.

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,800
Jordan? You arrived from Jordan
just now? Welcome.

27
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,120
I have a real issue with Jordanians.

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,080
You know why? Because you kiss
three times, just like us.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,479
We kiss three times.

30
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,560
And I didn't know
that in Jordan, you kiss...

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,520
Some time ago,
I was in Jordan and met someone.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,080
We were about to greet each other
with a kiss.

33
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,160
I started my...
and he also started his...

34
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,080
and we kept on going sideways like that.

35
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,760
It was dramatic!

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,640
His tongue touched my tonsils!

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,160
I looked at him and said, "That's it!
What are you doing tonight?"

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,960
We really should stop this kissing!

40
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,160
Who in the audience is not Lebanese?

41
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,640
- Where are you from?
- Syria.

42
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,480
I said not Lebanese!

43
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,560
With all confidence, Syria.

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,040
We're your guests now, God bless you!

45
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,040
I welcome us over here in your country.

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,800
We're almost competing with them here.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,440
Glad that you're here with us.

48
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,280
The Syrians and us kiss in the same way.

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,960
Or do you have a different way?

50
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,320
Two kisses, like Europeans. Perfect.

51
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Not like us Lebanese and Jordanians.

52
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,120
Who else is not Lebanese?

53
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,920
There's a crowd here from abroad!
Where are you from?

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,560
Egypt? Great.

55
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,680
In Egypt too it's just two kisses, right?
Two kisses, nice!

56
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,399
Now this is culture, not like us!

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,240
We are a horny people!

58
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,760
The minute we see each other,
we kiss! Jesus!

59
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,240
But with all due respect
to all your nationalities,

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,360
we Lebanese are super kissers.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,120
You see how the minute we meet,
we start kissing?

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,000
You've only left him for five minutes,
but when he sees you again, he goes...

63
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,600
Come!

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,320
Come!

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,800
Not like this. Like this!

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,000
In whatever situation, we kiss.
Whatever, we kiss.

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,840
Even if a guy is sick, you kiss him.
He sneezes.

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,920
So what? If one guy is sick,
he infects half of Lebanon!

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,240
When we meet, we kiss.
We say farewell, we kiss.

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,000
And those guys with a bushy beard!
It's a new trend.

71
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,360
Now what is that? A new trend, that!
He comes to kiss you, no chance he won't.

72
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,840
The minute he hugs you, you feel his fur!

73
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,200
It's like you're kissing a bear!
Totally drowned by it!

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,000
If the beard is sharp like steel,

75
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,320
it's like being on an emery board!

76
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,800
But that's not the guy I usually meet.
I only get the guy

77
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,040
who, just as you enter the men's room,
you hear the flush,

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,800
then the door opens and out he comes,
barely finished his business.

79
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,360
And there we are. "Hello!

80
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,960
Come here, you."
And you go, "Hello. Hello!"

81
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,840
He says, "Come here, you."

82
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,640
And you start thinking of
what he's been up to in there.

83
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,280
Didn't wipe it.

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,800
And he sees you. "Hello."
He touches your face.

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,960
"Who's my best friend?
Who's the guy I love, man?"

86
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,120
I wish we would learn from women...
how they kiss.

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
They kiss from a distance.

88
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,960
There's always a space.

89
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,040
You'd think they were disgusted
by each other!

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,240
"Hi!"

91
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,040
We could be sweaty, and still kiss.

92
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,920
It's like kissing someone in the rain
at the Roucha.

93
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,800
Some guys are born kissers.

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
Like the guy who sells clothes
on Haamra Street at 1 p. m.

95
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,080
Just eaten falafel,

96
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
and has his falafel sandwich in his hand,
a chilli pepper in the other,

97
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
and holding it out
so it wouldn't drip on him.

98
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,680
You know that guy? Standing there
munching on the sandwich,

99
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,480
his moustache full of falafel crumbs,

100
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,760
tahini and chilli pepper,

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,480
and chilli pepper seeds
dangling from his nose hair!

102
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,360
You look at his face
and he goes, "Hello! Come here, you.

103
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
Come here, you."

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He hugs you and you get one side
with tahini and the other, red turnips!

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,200
But the worst is the guy
who's eaten chicken,

106
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,520
then had a breath mint.

107
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,880
He comes over, close to your ear...

108
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,960
"Hey, dear!"

109
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,680
He blows it all in your ear.
And the smell of garlic is everywhere!

110
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,760
You say, "You smell like garlic."
He says, "I had a breath mint!" What mint?

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,040
You need a stomach pump, damn you!

112
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,760
If you decide to add up all the kisses
you get in a day,

113
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,760
mathematically, it's like you've had sex.

114
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,200
All day long, kiss, kiss, kiss.
You should be up here...come on!

115
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,200
Speaking of food and falafel,

116
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,159
we Lebanese,

117
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,039
for those who don't know us,
and this is just my personal opinion,

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
our stomachs are like garbage cans!

119
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,120
Whatever you dump in, we eat it.
Everything.

120
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,080
I mean, have you ever thought
about the sheep that falls into our hands?

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,600
Poor thing!

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,280
When a Lebanese gets his hands on a sheep,
he's worse than ISIS!

123
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,840
We make it disappear!
We eat every bit of it.

124
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,760
We leave nothing out!
The head is made into nifa.

125
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,960
You're invited to a nifa meal,
the best thing they offer is the eyeball.

126
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,240
"Here, try it, it's tasty and crunchy.
But juicy!"

127
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,440
The tongue we cook with lime and garlic,

128
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,120
and they say, "Wow! Delicious."

129
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,520
The liver we make into sawda.

130
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,240
Is anything more delicious
than having raw sawda for breakfast

131
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,480
with onion and mint? Delicious!

132
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,080
What else? The intestines.
We don't throw them out!

133
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,680
For those of you who are not familiar
with how the Lebanese do it,

134
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,840
we don't throw out the intestines.
We make them into sausages.

135
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,640
We stuff them with rice and meat.

136
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,840
You could say,
"Ew! There used to be shit in there!"

137
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,440
And I'd say, "That's OK.
We wash them first."

138
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,160
Even if there's still a bit of shit, we
douse them in lime and garlic, no problem.

139
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,400
No big deal. Now, is there anything
tastier than the sheep's balls?

140
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,360
They're delicious.

141
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,080
But my favorite is the fatty tail.

142
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,440
That's really something,
if you think about it, though.

143
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,520
The sheep grazes all day long,
eating greens.

144
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,640
So his tail is right over his asshole.

145
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
All day long, he grazes then...

146
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,440
You'll be totally grossed out by sheep,
just you wait!

147
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,440
You know that we eat every bit
of the sheep except his penis!

148
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,360
I never got that! Why not? Suck on it!

149
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,560
Suck on it and see where that'll get you.

150
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,320
The fleece? We never throw out the fleece.
We make it into a rug.

151
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,160
Not right to waste any part of the sheep.
You have a friend who's a taxi driver,

152
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,440
he'll think the world of you
if you give him the fleece.

153
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,600
He'd put it on the dashboard,
with that waving-hand thing.

154
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,160
And what's hot now is that toy dog.

155
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,640
You stick it on the dashboard
and he goes...

156
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,040
You just press the brakes and...

157
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,600
Then with all that,
they tell you you'll be fine.

158
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,040
When you eat sheep meat,
drink Araak with it.

159
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,320
It kills the microbes.

160
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
What microbes?

161
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,520
Do you see what crap you're eating?
You need to drink acid to clear that!

162
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,400
A while ago, I was invited to a friend's.
They had slaughtered a sheep.

163
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,720
I ate so much! I pigged out.

164
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,120
I sucked the bones, legs, intestines.

165
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,880
I was going to burst! I was suffering!

166
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,760
That's normal. No way you won't suffer
after eating like that.

167
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,720
All kinds of microbes
were floating in my stomach.

168
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,160
They immediately took me to the ER.

169
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,720
Now, our Lebanese hospitals are odd.

170
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,200
If you go there in an ambulance,
the minute they reach the ER,

171
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,920
they press the brakes
and open the door

172
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,280
and they dump you on a wheelchair
like you were a pizza ready for the oven.

173
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,000
The minute I got there, they put me
on a wheelchair, and I'm dying here!

174
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,200
And what can I do? Whenever I go to
the hospital, no one believes I'm sick!

175
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,880
Weird! What? Can't I get sick?
The minute I got there...

176
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,400
You know, once you get to the ER,
before they ask what's wrong with you,

177
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,160
their first question is,
insurance or no insurance?

178
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,640
They want to make sure
they're getting paid!

179
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,280
They want to know how to handle you.

180
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,440
They wouldn't believe I was sick.
A woman came over.

181
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,120
They're all venomous.

182
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,920
They can really choose them.

183
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,720
She walked over,
and I was sprawled on the chair.

184
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,960
She came over...

185
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,800
"Oh, it's you.

186
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,760
You've come to make fun of us?"

187
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,640
Dripping venom!

188
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,400
Then another one...a question
they always ask me. "Where's Abbas?"

189
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
Abbas and I should be sick together!

190
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,440
They put me on the stretcher,
dumped me there.

191
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,080
The third venomous lady came,
trying to insert the drip.

192
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,480
I'm in agony! My screams are going up
to God. She kept jabbing and jabbing.

193
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,800
She needed a hammer to push in
whatever the heck that was!

194
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
She drilled my bones
and finally it got in.

195
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,120
I screamed in pain! She said, "Enough.

196
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,440
Are you the only one
who gets to hurt people?"

197
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,280
After they examined me,
that's where the problem started.

198
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,040
They said, "You need a colonoscopy."

199
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,840
You laughed
because you went through that too.

200
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,800
I saw you flinch.

201
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,440
Yeah, colonoscopy.

202
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,320
Who's been through that?

203
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,960
Who has the courage
to say he's been through with it?

204
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,560
You've all been through it!

205
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
You're all lying!
Who's been through it up there?

206
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,120
You all have your hands on your asses!
Not me!

207
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:48,400
OK, they sent me to the colonoscopy
specialist. He came to explain.

208
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,560
He said, "We'll do this procedure because
we have to know what's happening inside.

209
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,000
We'll go in and find out."

210
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,320
I said, "But, Doctor,
it might hurt my tonsils."

211
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
He said, "No, they won't hurt."

212
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,840
I said, "Don't you go in from here?"
He said, "No, from down there."

213
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,040
I said, "OK. So what do we do?"

214
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,680
He said, "Don't worry.

215
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,160
Just relax."

216
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,160
"What do I do now?" He said,
"We'll have to give you an anesthetic.

217
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,640
Do you want a local
or a general anesthetic?"

218
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,760
I said, "I've never done this before."

219
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,160
I thought it was a money trap,

220
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
so I said a local anesthetic.

221
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,320
I shouldn't have said that.

222
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,600
They dressed me in a gown.

223
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,440
The gown for the colonoscopy
is different from that of the hospital.

224
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,680
You remember it, right?

225
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:44,480
It's like...You know the Teletubbies?

226
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,320
You look just like Teletubbies.

227
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,960
You wear a full-on onesie,
but...open in the ass!

228
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,520
So they know where to aim!

229
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,480
And during the procedure,
you're not alone.

230
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,480
There are four or five others
ready for this procedure.

231
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,320
You're all standing there
looking like Teletubbies

232
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,600
with your asses out there,

233
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,320
and the nurses looking at all those asses!

234
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Is that a woman or a guy laughing?

235
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,600
A ringing laugh!

236
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,760
So, they came
and stuck in the colonoscope.

237
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,200
They lay me on my side.

238
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,000
On your side so he can check you.

239
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,839
That doctor had two trainees with him.

240
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm lying there, and the trainees...

241
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,800
are taking notes.

242
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,880
"First, you dip it in the Vaseline,
put it in the Vaseline."

243
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,440
The doctor is explaining.
It's a colonoscope!

244
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,000
Not a...Colonoscope!

245
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,480
He dips it in the Vaseline
and starts to poke it in.

246
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,000
The trainees with him are really focusing

247
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,040
so they don't miss anything.
They don't want to fail.

248
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,080
He kept poking and poking.
You'd think it's local anesthetic.

249
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,080
But, no! There's something to be said
about that!

250
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,520
Poking and poking till I felt...

251
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,920
Doctor!

252
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,120
As he was poking and stuffing it in,
a student came rushing in.

253
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,440
"Sorry, Professor, for being late.
Traffic was terrible."

254
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,440
No worries, we'll get it out again.

255
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,120
And there I was.

256
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,320
To tell you the truth, I kind of liked it!

257
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,160
It's kind of special!

258
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,400
So he said, "Don't worry, we'll put it
in the Vaseline, and stuff it in again."

259
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Stuff, stuff, stuff...
A fourth student came in.

260
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,280
"Sorry, Professor..." I said, "Fuck!

261
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm gonna start liking that!

262
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,480
I've never considered that.
You're making me think about it!

263
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,200
It was supposed to be simple.
What is this?"

264
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,640
I said, "Doctor, what are you doing?"
He said, "It's OK."

265
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,720
He started pulling it out.
I said, "What do you mean, it's OK?

266
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,040
Before the fourth student,
I was this size. Now I'm this size!"

267
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,440
We finished the procedure,

268
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,040
and they said, "Mr. Karam, you have
to spend the night in the hospital.

269
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,560
We'll take you up to the room to rest."

270
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,120
I said, "OK."

271
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,840
He said, "You have insurance?"
I said, "Sure."

272
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,480
"But your insurance covers you
for second class."

273
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,920
I said, "What is that?"
I didn't know what second class meant.

274
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,240
I thought...second class,
OK, it's cheaper, but it's OK.

275
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,680
Turns out, there's a big difference
between second class and first class.

276
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,360
A whole different story.

277
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,400
They took me to the appropriate floor,
sitting in the wheelchair.

278
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,160
In second class, there is no privacy.

279
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,040
Everyone on the second-class floor
knew I'd had a colonoscopy.

280
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,120
Everyone!

281
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,280
They put me in a wheelchair that had
the round rubber thing so I could sit.

282
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,320
A guy passing by said, "What?

283
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,280
You got stuffed?

284
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,720
Cool!"

285
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,680
They took me to my room.
Number 104, I still remember it.

286
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,360
On my way, a Bengali orderly looked at me.

287
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,680
He said, "Hello, sir,
how was the colonoscopy?

288
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
Hurt your ass?"

289
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
Anyway, they took me to the room.

290
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,480
In second-class rooms, there are two beds.
I didn't know.

291
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,480
It was my first time.
Thank God I was old enough.

292
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,200
So, there were two beds in the room.

293
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,960
The one on the left had a view.

294
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,000
What view, you ask? A cemetery!

295
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,480
The right-hand-side bed
was against the wall.

296
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,640
What's cool is,
when they take you to the room,

297
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,760
they throw you on the bed
like a sack of potatoes.

298
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,600
"Throw him!"

299
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,640
And there you are.

300
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,240
That's what it's like in second class.

301
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,320
The nurses came to hang the drip
and take my temperature.

302
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:23,360
In the next bed there was an elderly man,
about 80 years old.

303
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,560
I got to know him and his wife.
She was, like, 70.

304
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,360
His name was Abo Dani,
and his wife, Em Dani.

305
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,600
I'll tell you all about them.

306
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,440
The nurses came; two nurses in charge
of the whole floor in second class.

307
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,960
Their names were Enaam and Aida.

308
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
What blew my mind was when you call
for Enaam, ten nurses answer!

309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,040
And when you call Aida, ten answer!

310
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,880
That floor was specifically
for the Enaams and Aidas!

311
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,840
Enaam had served 15 years
of hard labor in prison,

312
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,480
and then was pardoned.

313
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:09,440
Her hair was black and crinkly,
thick eyebrows, itty-bitty eyes,

314
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,800
and sideburns running down to her mouth,
with a bleached moustache,

315
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,720
as if the problem were its color!

316
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,560
Aida, on the other hand,

317
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,280
she was short, skinny,
with short white hair,

318
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,760
a fuzz of hair here, and she hates men.

319
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,720
They came to take my temperature.

320
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,600
They lay me on my side, with my face
to the wall and my ass to Abo Dani.

321
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,360
At this point, my asshole was this wide.
The thermometer wouldn't stay in!

322
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,800
She puts it towards the bottom, it slips.
She puts it up top...

323
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,720
Now, mind you, Abo Dani
had been there for a long time,

324
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,120
so he's familiar with Enaam and Aida.

325
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
He was joining in too!

326
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,120
Abo Dani looked and said,
"I don't know.

327
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,680
Son, clench your asshole
so this will work."

328
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,680
I said, "Abo Dani, what do you mean?
I'm clenching! It's not working."

329
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,680
Then Em Dani chimes in,
"Wrap some gauze around it to thicken it."

330
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,120
Yeah, right, all between me,
Abo Dani, Em Dani, Enaam and Aida.

331
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:28,360
Em Dani got up,
came closer and looked at my ass.

332
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,720
She said, "Abo Dani, I see a zit.
I don't like the look of his ass."

333
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,120
He said, "Tell him to put some mallow
on it. It'll go."

334
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,840
Abo Dani

335
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,560
is really something.

336
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,800
I liked him a lot.
We got quite attached.

337
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,800
He had been in that room for a long time.
A long time in 104.

338
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,760
How did I know that?
When I got into the room,

339
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,640
it didn't feel like entering
a hospital room.

340
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,320
It felt like I was going
into Abo Dani's home.

341
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,000
Em Dani had put a welcome mat
at the door.

342
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,240
Then as I was lying there,
I noticed there was a shelf under the TV.

343
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,640
Em Dani
had her children's pictures up on it!

344
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Dani as a child, Dani as he got older,
Dani is fat,

345
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,520
a picture of Danielle, their elder
daughter, married and living in Canada.

346
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,960
On top of the TV, Em Dani
had put a piece of crotchet work.

347
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,680
You know, crotchet.

348
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,600
What did it say?
"Our Father who art in Heaven..."

349
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,960
Crotchet work saying, "Our Father
who art in Heaven..." on top of the TV!

350
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,880
In the corner Em Dani had put up
a shrine to the Virgin Mary,

351
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,520
with dripping candles,

352
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,360
and a charity box
for the restoration of Mar Shalita church.

353
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,800
Thank God the doctor came.

354
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,760
He didn't come to my room. The doctors
don't usually come to second class.

355
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,520
Only trainees.

356
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,120
Impossible to see a doctor.

357
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,240
Even if you holler, no doctor comes,
only trainees.

358
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,200
One came and said, "Mr. Karam,
the doctor told us to tell you

359
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,600
that you'll need to spend another night
in hospital." I said, "Wait!

360
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,560
OK. Is it possible to upgrade
to first class?" He said, "Sure."

361
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,320
I said, "Fine. Send me a surgeon.
I'll have to sell you my kidney, I guess."

362
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,280
The move is expensive! The change to
first class is an issue! Damn expensive.

363
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,880
Anyway, I was moved to first class.

364
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,800
In first class,

365
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,480
there's no Enaam and Aida.

366
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,680
There's Cynthia and Jennifer.

367
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,240
You feel euphoric
the minute you reach first class.

368
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,040
You smell the jasmine.

369
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,640
You look, and there are Cynthia
and Jennifer. Let me tell you about them.

370
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,560
They look kind of like Anabella.

371
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Tall, beautiful, sexy, you could just
eat them up! Gorgeous.

372
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,600
They live on toast and quinoa.

373
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,880
Just lovely.

374
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,360
What's cool is that when they come
to hook up the drip,

375
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,240
they're nothing like Enaam and Aida.
When Enaam came to do that,

376
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,520
she stepped on the bed, smashed my face
and hooked up the drip.

377
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,400
Cynthia bent down and hooked it up.

378
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,960
Five-star treatment in first class!

379
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:34,680
If only you could see how Cynthia
received me. They're multi-lingual!

380
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,640
"Bonsoir, Monsieur Karam,
welcome to first class.

381
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
Welcome, Mr. Karam."

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,160
The room, let me tell you about that.

383
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:47,520
Lovely. Very spacious, white walls.
No green walls here.

384
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,040
A king-size bed,
an LED-screen TV...curved!

385
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,080
The remote control is there in your hand.
Not like with Em Dani!

386
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,120
Only a champ could get it from her.

387
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,440
If you touch it...stop it!

388
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,440
In first class, there are no trainees.

389
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,400
They're all professors and up.

390
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,720
A professor came to check on my status.
I was asleep.

391
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,720
Snoozing. I felt his hand touching my ear.

392
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,600
"Mr. Karam?

393
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,800
Mr. Karam?

394
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,000
Sorry to wake you up.
We just need to check on you.

395
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,800
I'm Professor Ajeeaa."

396
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,200
I said, "Hello, Professor."
He said, "Guess who is here with me."

397
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,680
I looked and said, "Who?"

398
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,240
He said, "The insurance company manager,
the hospital manager and the doctor.

399
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,000
Look who else is here." I looked up
and saw all the saints there.

400
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,920
Even Mar Shalita was there!

401
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,160
Food in first class is another story.

402
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,920
When you eat there, it's like watching
one of those cooking shows on MTV.

403
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,760
Unbelievable.

404
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
I asked, "What are we having today?"

405
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,960
She said, "Mr. Karam, today it's duck
with cauliflower and red radish."

406
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
I said, "Wow, cool."

407
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,920
She went on, "And for dessert,

408
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,840
we have puff pastry
with a raspberry and cherry reduction."

409
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,240
I said, "Perfect!"

410
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,960
The food comes accompanied
by a violinist!

411
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,280
There I was using
the fork and knife and...

412
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
When I finished, I saw Jennifer standing.

413
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,000
She said, "Mr. Karam,
we're ready to burp you."

414
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,840
Six months later, I went to the hospital
to visit a sick friend.

415
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,640
He had some health problems.

416
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:57,440
When I went there, I realized that
that was where Abo Dani was.

417
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,160
So I decided
to go and see how he was doing.

418
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,960
On my way, I met a trainee and asked him,
"Is Abo Dani still here?"

419
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,800
He said, "Where else would he be?

420
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,680
He's kind like a guinea pig!
We're experimenting on him!

421
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,240
He's here for good!"

422
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,040
I got to his room, and found some extras
that Em Dani had added.

423
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,640
Things I hadn't seen before.
They installed a bell!

424
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,840
His name was on the door: Edmond Megaes,
and, in brackets, Abo Dani.

425
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,400
I heard a whirring sound inside.

426
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,840
I rang the bell...birds chirruping.

427
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,840
She couldn't hear it. I knocked hard
on the door. She finally opened it.

428
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,400
Her hair was up and she was vacuuming!

429
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,240
She'd brought down the winter clothes
and laid out a rug.

430
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,040
She even had a Christmas tree up.

431
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,720
As I walked in, I heard Abo Dani...

432
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,880
I said, "Hey, Abo Dani, how are you now?
I hope you're feeling better."

433
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,760
He said,
"Yeah, thanks to yesterday's meal."

434
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,760
My dear Abo Dani,
I will never forget him,

435
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,480
like I will never forget
my trip to Africa.

436
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,080
I want to tell you
about my experience there.

437
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,560
There might be a lot of people
who know about it,

438
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,800
but also there are many who don't.

439
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,080
Who's been to Africa?

440
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,600
Anyone visited Africa?

441
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,760
We should all go visit Africa.
We men should go visit Africa

442
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,600
to get an idea
of what things are like there.

443
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,080
Some time ago I went to Africa
to visit my friend Ali Shour.

444
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,880
I love my friend. Bonjour, Aloush.

445
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:56,440
I'll tell you. I was with Ali
in the Ivory Coast, a beautiful country.

446
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,280
The roads, left and right,
are lined with banana trees.

447
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,440
I was in the car with Ali, I remember.
We were talking.

448
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,200
I am a bachelor, and this was guys' talk.

449
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,120
I said, "Aloush, I want to
meet an African woman.

450
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,600
Everything is naturally 'built in.'
No plastic surgery."

451
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:24,000
"Yeah, sure," he said. "I know
a beautiful woman, I'll call her."

452
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,360
He was calling her,
we're sitting in traffic.

453
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,000
I swear to you, this is what happened.

454
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,840
I was sitting in the car,

455
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,120
and over on this side, there's a river.

456
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,040
As he was calling her,
I was looking around.

457
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,280
I saw a guy bathing. An African guy.

458
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:45,320
At first glance,
I thought he had three legs.

459
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,240
I saw three legs!
I looked again and, no, not three legs!

460
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,920
He saw me staring at him down there,
so what did he do? He hauled it up,

461
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,880
and started scrubbing himself.

462
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,840
He picked a banana leaf
and started scrubbing.

463
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,440
He was grabbing it and scrubbing.

464
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,240
I mean, what is that?
I couldn't believe it!

465
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,840
I said, "Ali, hang up.
Don't just hang up, switch it off!"

466
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,400
He said, "Why?" I said, "Look!

467
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,200
What is that? He's in the water.
It's shrunk, but it's still that long!"

468
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,480
He said, "So what?" I said, "Cancel
the call. I don't want that woman."

469
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,800
He said, "But we already called her."
I said, "I don't want to look bad!"

470
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,520
He said, "Why?" I said, "Imagine I go to
the hotel, I strip down and she comes in.

471
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,080
The first thing she'll say is,
'Where is it?'

472
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,160
She's used to the half-meter and more!

473
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,400
What would she think of 17 centimeters?
She won't even see it!

474
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,000
She would need a pair of tweezers
to pull it out!

475
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,400
I'll be humiliated. Don't want it.

476
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,160
Did I come to Africa to be humiliated?

477
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,720
She'll be like,
'Alright, just come and tickle me.'"

478
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Their sizes are really different.

479
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,720
Different. No, no. I was traumatized.

480
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,400
I noticed something else there too.

481
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,960
They sell water in a bag,
and pistachios in a bottle.

482
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,000
Go figure.

483
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,200
They are so comfortable
with their sex organs.

484
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,800
No problem. Here, things are censored.
There, it's all good.

485
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,000
If a guy feels like it, he just whips
it out, right there and then.

486
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,320
I went to the hotel, depressed.
My room was on the 13th floor.

487
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,640
Out on the balcony having a smoke.
I used to smoke back then.

488
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,400
I saw the hotel manager
walking around with a guy

489
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,480
talking about removing a banana tree,
and doing this and that.

490
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,720
I saw him, and I guess he needed to pee.

491
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,600
Mind you, I'm on 13th floor.

492
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,560
He unzipped his pants
and started rolling it out like a rope!

493
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,679
And I'm standing there on the 13th floor,
and I see something really long! Really!

494
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,560
And he's just talking
as he was pulling it out,

495
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,719
and he was going about his business.

496
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,000
On the other side, a woman
had this red sack on her head.

497
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,080
She's topless, with a tree leaf here,
and walking along.

498
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,440
Big ass!

499
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,960
She was going to pass in front of the guy
as he was peeing.

500
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,520
Right in front of him.

501
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,920
For a second,
I imagined he was gonna tell his friend

502
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,960
to grab the other end of it
and go like this. "Come."

503
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
After that...

504
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,760
After that I told Ali,
I don't want to go to Africa.

505
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,560
From now on, if I travel,
I'd be better off going to China.

506
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,960
In China, 17 centimeters,
you'd be a champ!

507
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,240
Rocco, the stud!

508
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,480
You laughed when I said Rocco!

509
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,840
Guess you know who he is!

510
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,640
Rocco is a porn star.

511
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,560
She blushed! She knows him.

512
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:46,000
Only men are supposed to laugh at that.
I said Rocco and she went...

513
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,360
Speaking of porn, you know?

514
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,920
Statistics show that we Arabs
rank number one in watching porn sites.

515
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,840
Seriously. But we don't admit it.

516
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,080
You know who else doesn't admit it?
Women.

517
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,880
You ask a woman, do you watch porn?
She goes, "Ew!

518
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,440
Disgusting!"

519
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,640
A new bride would be sitting there
and the groom comes along,

520
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,000
thinking that she's...

521
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,760
He'd asked her before,
"Do you watch porn?"

522
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,680
She said, "No, that's disgusting!
Don't mention porn!"

523
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:37,040
He starts undressing and turns around,
she's there in high heels and lingerie.

524
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,440
Suddenly it's all spilling out.

525
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
"What shall we do today, baby?

526
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,520
Eagle position?"

527
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,680
"What's the eagle position?"

528
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,240
"You climb on top of the closet, jump off,
and I'll be here with my legs wide open,

529
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,880
and when you get here
you flap and gyrate."

530
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,920
He's shocked!

531
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,080
"How do you know?
You've never seen porn."

532
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,960
"Yeah, whatever. I know a few things.
Let's try the chandelier position."

533
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,800
"What's that?"

534
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
"You climb up the chandelier, you twirl,

535
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,160
I lay here, you come down
on top of me and twirl."

536
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,600
"Where do you get these ideas?"

537
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,800
"You know what my favorite position is?

538
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,680
The washing machine.

539
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,800
I sit on top of the washing machine,
you stand,

540
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,080
and the washing machine
does all the work."

541
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,680
So you know Rocco.

542
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,760
He gets really sweaty! A lot!

543
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,000
Have any of you ever watched
a full porn movie?

544
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,920
I've only gotten as far as 15 minutes,
that's my maximum.

545
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,800
No more. I wish someone would tell me.

546
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,840
What happens at the end?
Does the leading man die?

547
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,360
I would like to know
what happens to him.

548
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,360
How does a porn movie end? I don't know.

549
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,480
You finish off and that's it.

550
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,880
In porn movies, the leading man
is always the pizza delivery guy.

551
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,640
Before I started acting,
I worked in a pizza place.

552
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,640
I had my eye on our neighbor.

553
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,000
I was waiting for her to order a pizza.
One day, she did.

554
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,440
I got ready and put on my pants,
wearing nothing underneath.

555
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,640
In porn movies they slip off their pants
and they're ready.

556
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,800
I arrived with the pizza,

557
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,280
ready for action
and doing all the porn-star moves.

558
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,160
Like this. She opened the door,
took the pizza, kicked the door shut.

559
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,000
There's also the pool man.

560
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,520
Yeah? He's always cute.

561
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,200
The women sit there around the pool,
lying there, then they get topless.

562
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,000
And he's there cleaning the pool.

563
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
And they're there, flirting.

564
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,560
He moves closer. And closer.

565
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,280
And he does them!

566
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,880
But the best guy is the plumber who wears
his overalls, with nothing underneath.

567
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,120
She calls him, "Please, I need a plumber."

568
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,800
He arrives right away. She opens the door,
he's standing there, with a body like a V!

569
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,000
He undoes his overalls, and he's naked!

570
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,280
Our plumbers are different!

571
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,320
Our plumber comes over with a belly,

572
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,760
he bends down and you see his ass.

573
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,200
A plumber comes to your house
to fix the tap.

574
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,640
He bends over
and you can see red butt cheeks.

575
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,520
There are different levels.
Plumber with red butt cheeks,

576
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,720
plumber with non-red hairy ass,

577
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,200
and the higher level has red butt cheeks
and hairy ass.

578
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:27,200
Hair coming out at you.
No hair on top, but hair down there.

579
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,200
You'd be standing in dripping water
with your wife.

580
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,280
He's bending over, in front of her.
And there's his ass!

581
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,200
"Enough!

582
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,960
Shut up!

583
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,480
Let him fix the tap. It's good he came!"

584
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,120
I don't watch porn.
It means nothing to me now.

585
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:04,680
My advice to all guys is, if you want
to watch something to get you worked up,

586
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,840
watch a women's tennis match.

587
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,800
I speak from experience.

588
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,720
When I watch a women's tennis match,
I get...a shiver!

589
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,600
When you see the match,
you feel like they're challenging you.

590
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,640
Think about it. Their skirts are so short,
and their thighs! How do they get those?

591
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,240
So long! The way she holds the racket!

592
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,960
You get the point! When I go to watch
a match, I prepare myself.

593
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,920
A towel, a whisky bottle, tissue paper,

594
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,240
a trash bin, and I sit, ready.

595
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,600
I'm prepared. I won't watch otherwise.

596
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,840
Look at how they stand,
holding the racket like that.

597
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,600
The director always takes
close-ups of her face.

598
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,200
You see the sweat running down.
And she goes...

599
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,160
The other player, with her thighs.

600
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,720
He takes a shot from below, going up,
with sweat running down.

601
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,840
The short skirt,
and two balls stacked there.

602
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,360
And the referee says, "Quiet, please."

603
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,400
He wants silence.

604
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,320
It starts and she dribbles the ball...

605
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,080
I pull off the towel and get going.

606
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,520
And I go...

607
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,560
Damn you!

608
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,840
In porn, we don't go more than 15 minutes.
Here, we don't go more than one set!

609
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,680
I can tell you all this
because I'm not married.

610
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,000
Can you imagine if I were married?
God forbid!

611
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,720
I hate marriage.

612
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,680
I was married once.
It's my fault, not hers

613
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,840
I don't want to be overdramatic.

614
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,960
But I won't have it.
I don't even like going to weddings.

615
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,600
Weddings in Lebanon are weird.

616
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,720
I noticed something. Our weddings here,
if you don't know, are all the same.

617
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,000
I hate going to weddings. Hate it!

618
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,200
When I get invited,

619
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,000
I feel I'm going to applaud a couple
who are going to screw after a while.

620
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,720
The shittiest occasion in the world!

621
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,440
Imagine, standing there clapping...

622
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,800
What the hell is this?

623
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:10,640
And weddings here are all the same.

624
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,680
The venue always has a staircase.

625
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,680
If you go to any wedding, there's
a staircase, and the bride comes down.

626
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,040
There's always a wedding procession.
This last wedding had extra.

627
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,040
Not a regular procession,

628
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,600
but 100 costumed performers.

629
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,880
And on the other side, 100 costumed women.

630
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,680
They took us back in history to Saladin's
days. Women carrying water jugs.

631
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,160
And the men swinging their swords.

632
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,880
If you go to the toilet, you have to
be careful. They might slice you in half!

633
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,920
There's this loud guy at the party

634
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,160
who stands with the microphone, calling
for the bride to come down the stairs.

635
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,640
As he does that,

636
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,480
everyone is supposed to stand there
waiting for the bride to appear.

637
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:11,680
I was sitting there at this wedding.
Luckily I knew the groom, not the bride.

638
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,920
This guy started shouting.

639
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:20,240
She was on a seat carried by four guys.

640
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:26,480
She sits there and they carry her down
the stairs, so that people can be awed!

641
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,240
So the guy starts calling for her...

642
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,160
"Reveal yourself, you beautiful gazelle."

643
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:37,760
"Reveal yourself, face of the moon."

644
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,600
"Reveal yourself, night moon..."

645
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,480
When he says that,

646
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,640
she's supposed to appear up there.

647
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:56,280
The minute he said that,
something appeared.

648
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,040
Night Moon appeared up there...

649
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,320
and everyone went...

650
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,400
A woman sitting next to me wet her pants!

651
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,120
"What is that?"

652
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,840
You know the witch on the broom?

653
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,080
She's a beauty
compared to our Night Moon.

654
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,920
Coming down those stairs,
the four guys were like...

655
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,480
And she's just sitting there.

656
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,280
And that idiot, the groom...
thinks she's a real beauty!

657
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,840
It was such a shock, because
Lebanese women are usually beautiful!

658
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,680
But at weddings,
I'm not sure what happens!

659
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,600
Do you see what happens to women
when they go to weddings?

660
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,200
They all think they have to surpass
the beauty of Night Moon.

661
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:08,960
She'll be, like, 1.30 meters tall,
and her husband is 1.85 meters.

662
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,440
At weddings. She'll be walking
with her husband...

663
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,600
She's in high heels,

664
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,480
with huge hair, tons of eyeliner,

665
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,560
in her shimmering dress,
holding her husband's hand.

666
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,840
He's walking next to her
and she's strutting along.

667
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,800
<i>Avatar!</i>

668
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,120
At that wedding, I was scared shitless!

669
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,920
And Night Moon's girlfriends.

670
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,040
Usually at the table, you're with people
you don't know, so you can mingle.

671
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,280
A girl was sitting next to me
in a shimmering dress,

672
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,720
next to her mom. Her mom was like...

673
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,240
with all the nipping and tucking,

674
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,200
this was here and that was there!

675
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,520
A little too much nipping and tucking!
No more places to tuck!

676
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,000
She's sitting next to her mom,
who starts to poke her.

677
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,520
"Get up and dance.

678
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,920
Get up and dance!

679
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,560
That's Patrick, just arrived from Dubai."

680
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,520
Her mom is her pimp!
I'm, like, what is this?

681
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:29,960
And the fat girl, a friend of Night Moon,

682
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,560
all she cares about
is catching the bouquet.

683
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,680
Wants to get hitched. She has, like,
250 bouquets, but it hasn't worked yet.

684
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,240
She has a greenhouse at home.
No matter.

685
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,080
Night Moon got hitched by chance!

686
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,240
My favorite is the girl
who had her eye on that idiot.

687
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,520
But Night Moon got him first.

688
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,320
Know when she showed her true colors?
The dancing.

689
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,520
The music started and she got up.

690
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,760
So cool,

691
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,080
she got up to dance.

692
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,960
Showing him her moves. Like, "Look what
you're missing out on, asshole!"

693
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,200
There's also that mutual friend
of Night Moon and the idiot.

694
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,120
He's always this huge guy.

695
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:31,080
One meter 95. He picked up the idiot
and picked up Night Moon like this

696
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,680
and started to dance with them,
jumping up three meters.

697
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,400
Can you imagine? He's in a shiny gray suit

698
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:40,360
and white shoes,

699
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,360
red hair that's sticky
because he's sweating.

700
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,840
He's carrying them both
because he's friends with them both.

701
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,640
Just like being in a rodeo! Hang on!

702
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:56,280
Night Moon wipes her eyeliner
and looks even shittier.

703
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,560
And the more he sweats,
the more he wipes his face on her dress.

704
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,480
She kicks him and says "You'll dirty
the dress, you bastard! It's rented!"

705
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,440
But the best at the wedding
are the groom's friends.

706
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,120
They've been drunk for two days.

707
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,600
They arrive drunk
and leaning on each other.

708
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,120
One is leaning like this, and the other
like this, drinking whisky.

709
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,680
It's not going in their mouths!

710
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,960
It's spilling.
And they're telling terrible jokes.

711
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,480
Like...

712
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,520
Their mouths are drooling!

713
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,720
"Hey, groom...

714
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,360
Hey, groom."

715
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,520
They want everyone to listen.

716
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,160
"Groom, we want you
to make us hold our heads up high."

717
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,880
I looked at him and said,
"What do you mean?

718
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,200
What's your head got to do over there
between her thighs?

719
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,400
Say something else!"

720
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,880
So what did they start joking about?
One said, "Listen to this.

721
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,000
Hey, groom.

722
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,840
Did you eat caviar?"

723
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,480
Egging him on. The other guy poked him.
"No no, groom. Eat shrimps."

724
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,960
I said to him, "Eat shit."

725
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:20,040
The best thing for you two.
No more dumb jokes.

726
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,320
Enough. I left that wedding
and it was the end of my sorrows.

727
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,640
I don't go to weddings anymore.
I am happy to attend funerals.

728
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,440
If the idiot and Night Moon die,
I will be the first at their funeral.

729
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,280
I love going to funerals.

730
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,200
I really like it. I really enjoy it.

731
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,400
The minute they see me,
they poke each other

732
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,960
"He's here.

733
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
The one who makes you
forget about your sadness."

734
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,720
I kiss them, and I don't know,
should I look happy? Sad?

735
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,440
I feel lost at a funeral.

736
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:58,800
We also have a certain way at funerals.

737
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:03,400
In Lebanon, all the funerals you go to
are exactly the same.

738
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,560
The family members stand
to receive condolences.

739
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,160
You go, "May he rest in peace."

740
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,600
There's always that one
who hugs you tightly

741
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,200
and starts to cry.

742
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,680
"We lost our dear one, we lost him."

743
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,040
He sniffles all over you.

744
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,440
You say, "May he rest in peace,
God be with you."

745
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,920
You go to the deceased's family
and ask, "Who's that?" They don't know!

746
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,240
He sniffled all over me! Who is he?"

747
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,920
And then you're sitting there

748
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,560
and the coffee guy comes along.

749
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,360
"Coffee, sir?" "No, thanks."

750
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,720
He walks around.

751
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,440
"Water?" "No, thanks."

752
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,200
Then he offers it over your shoulder.
"Coffee?"

753
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:01,720
At every funeral, there's the liar.

754
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,000
The coffin is in the middle of the room.

755
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,560
I'm sure you've seen this.
The coffin is in the room,

756
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:14,320
he waits till there's no crowd.
He's been hiding somewhere.

757
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,600
He wants to be the star. He approaches.

758
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,320
"Where is he?

759
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,440
Where is he? I lost my dear one!

760
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,960
You shouldn't be lying there!

761
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,560
Get up, little one.

762
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,120
Get up, my dear."

763
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,880
The family starts to cry.
"I lost my dear one!

764
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,440
What happened? How did he die?
He was with me three days ago. He was OK."

765
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,080
He hasn't seen him for three years.

766
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,520
"You're a liar. You shouldn't be here.

767
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,560
Only Aunty Audette should be here."

768
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,000
Aunty Audette. I've run into
Aunty Audette at, like, 15 funerals.

769
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,160
She's about 75. But looking at her,
you'd say she's around 50.

770
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,600
Nipped and tucked. Always smiling.

771
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:14,600
Her husband died 45 years ago,
and she looks like this,

772
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,920
and she's so old.
Two guys carry her in.

773
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,400
They go with her to put her
in front of the coffin.

774
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,440
They carry her in. "Where is he?"

775
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,520
These two are always with Aunty Audette.

776
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,840
They go with her to funerals
to put her in front of the coffin.

777
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,520
They throw her. And she starts.

778
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,880
"No, no, no.

779
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,200
This is not possible.

780
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,320
This is not possible.

781
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,280
You shouldn't be lying there!"
She kisses his cold hand.

782
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,320
"You left us too soon."

783
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,880
But something I've heard from her,

784
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,160
at all 15 funerals,
she says the same thing.

785
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,880
She says to every dead body she sees,
"Give my love to Edward."

786
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,440
That's her husband who died 45 years ago.

787
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:09,840
How can he send her love to Edward?

788
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:12,280
Is he the Lebanese postal service?

789
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,240
How can he do that?

790
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,160
She imagines he'll go up there, "Hi, guys.

791
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,280
Which one of you is Edward?"

792
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,480
And Edward is over there
playing backgammon.

793
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:32,760
He says, "I'm Edward". He says,
"Audette sends you love." "Yeah, I know.

794
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,640
You're the fourth one today
passing on her love."

795
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,520
So he asks him, "Edward, how did you die?"

796
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:43,160
"I killed myself
to get away from that bitch!"

797
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,720
I'm really happy to see you all.

798
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,520
I had so much fun with you.
I hope you had fun too.

799
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,240
In every show...

800
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:19,400
This is such a big night for me,

801
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:24,320
such a big night for me as a Lebanese.
The first Lebanese to be on Netflix.

802
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,280
You deserve it.

803
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,680
- Thank you, dear!
- You really deserve it.

804
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,680
My dear Alex, I recognize your voice.

805
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,680
If you'll allow me,
since this is such a special show,

806
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,440
I would like to dedicate each show
to my father.

807
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:50,560
He left us 18 years ago
and I really love him very much.

808
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,320
I really do.

809
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,200
And I want to say something, Dad, through
Netflix, Dad, I dedicate my show to you.

810
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,000
Wait!

811
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,960
Dad, give my love to Edward.

812
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,600
