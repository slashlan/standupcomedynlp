138
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,330
<font color="#ffff00">A lot of pauses with this one.
No, I bet that's it."</font>

139
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,292
<font color="#ffff00">No, there hasn't been one punch line
in that story.</font>

140
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,587
<font color="#ffff00">Just a long, boring story.</font>

141
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,424
<font color="#ffff00">Lucky for you, there's more to the story.</font>

142
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,429
<font color="#ffff00">The final day that I was working,
that Friday,</font>

143
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,682
<font color="#ffff00">I was sitting at my desk</font>

144
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:22,061
<font color="#ffff00">and the owner of the company
was crouched down doing something--</font>

145
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,689
<font color="#ffff00">I couldn't see. She was...
She was maybe...</font>

146
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,650
<font color="#ffff00">stacking or filing papers,</font>

147
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,861
<font color="#ffff00">just using little kitty paws, just...</font>

148
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,663
<font color="#ffff00">I'm known for my physical humor, so...
this is actually a highlight of the show.</font>

149
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:49,338
<font color="#ffff00">Again, no clue what she was doing,</font>

150
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,549
<font color="#ffff00">but she finally took an interest</font>

151
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,636
<font color="#ffff00">in who I was
as a human being on this planet.</font>

152
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,098
<font color="#ffff00">And she turned to me and she said...</font>

153
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,393
<font color="#ffff00">"So when you're not temping,</font>

154
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,687
<font color="#ffff00">what do you do?"</font>

155
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,232
<font color="#ffff00">And I could not wait...</font>

156
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,070
<font color="#ffff00">to turn to her
with every part of me destroyed...</font>

157
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,239
<font color="#ffff00">and say...</font>

158
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,460
<font color="#ffff00">"I'm a comedian."</font>

159
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,636
<font color="#ffff00">I might as well have said...</font>

160
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,978
<font color="#ffff00">"I'm training
to be a motivational speaker.</font>

161
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,898
<font color="#ffff00">And on the weekends,</font>

162
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,983
<font color="#ffff00">I play in a funk band."</font>

163
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,743
<font color="#ffff00">I'm happily married
forever and ever, amen.</font>

164
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,708
<font color="#ffff00">I take offense.</font>

165
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,837
<font color="#ffff00">The applause makes it seem
like you're thrilled</font>

166
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,131
<font color="#ffff00">that I'm finally off the market.</font>

167
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,011
<font color="#ffff00">But it's true.
I can't believe that Stephanie exists.</font>

168
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,555
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe that I found her.</font>

169
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,058
<font color="#ffff00">I can't believe that she loved me back.</font>

170
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,060
<font color="#ffff00">This is all true.</font>

171
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:30,940
<font color="#ffff00">And at least once a day...</font>

172
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:36,612
<font color="#ffff00">she says something
where I'm left utterly confused.</font>

173
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,867
<font color="#ffff00">Just unprompted yells across the house.</font>

174
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:48,499
<font color="#ffff00">For instance, "Do you know what time
Yum-Yum Donuts opens?"</font>

175
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,669
<font color="#ffff00">"Yum-Yum...</font>

176
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:59,593
<font color="#ffff00">No... No. Have you ever heard me say,
'I got to head down to Yum-Yum Donuts,</font>

177
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,178
<font color="#ffff00">beat the rush?'</font>

178
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,598
<font color="#ffff00">I don't even know what that is.</font>

179
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:08,686
<font color="#ffff00">Sounds delicious,
but I don't know anything about it."</font>

180
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,857
<font color="#ffff00">We were going on vacation,
driving to the airport,</font>

181
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,068
<font color="#ffff00">and in the car, she turned and asked,</font>

182
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,615
<font color="#ffff00">"Do you know what they're serving
for breakfast on this flight?"</font>

183
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,118
<font color="#ffff00">"Hmm...</font>

184
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,204
<font color="#ffff00">Mnh-mnh.</font>

185
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,040
<font color="#ffff00">No, I don't.</font>

186
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:32,835
<font color="#ffff00">Do you?"</font>

187
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:39,508
<font color="#ffff00">"Probably nothing surprising,
maybe eggs. I don't know."</font>

188
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,804
<font color="#ffff00">"Can a bee sting another bee?"</font>

189
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:52,938
<font color="#ffff00">"That I do not have the answer to.</font>

190
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,859
<font color="#ffff00">What I do know</font>

191
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:01,197
<font color="#ffff00">is it all of these questions
feel very Googleable."</font>

192
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,710
<font color="#ffff00">Stephanie and I adopted
a precious little kitten...</font>

193
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,837
<font color="#ffff00">named "Fluff."</font>

194
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,091
<font color="#ffff00">And that's her given name.</font>

195
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,804
<font color="#ffff00">We kept it out of respect
for her birth parents.</font>

196
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,558
<font color="#ffff00">And a couple years into having Fluff,</font>

197
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,395
<font color="#ffff00">I realized that I had never meowed at her.</font>

198
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,359
<font color="#ffff00">So I saw her across the living room,</font>

199
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:42,029
<font color="#ffff00">and I just thought, "You know what?
I'm gonna go ahead and meow at Fluff."</font>

200
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,032
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

201
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,911
<font color="#ffff00">I looked her right in the eyes and...</font>

202
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,164
<font color="#ffff00">I says to her, I says...</font>

203
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,212
<font color="#ffff00">Why do people talk like that?</font>

204
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:05,010
<font color="#ffff00">To say "I says to her" is improper,</font>

205
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,472
<font color="#ffff00">and then
to add on top of that "I says..."</font>

206
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,141
<font color="#ffff00">It's like, "Get outta here!"</font>

207
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,605
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway...</font>

208
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,108
<font color="#ffff00">I says to her, I says...</font>

209
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,027
<font color="#ffff00">"Meow!"</font>

210
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,196
<font color="#ffff00">And Fluff was like, "No way!</font>

211
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,991
<font color="#ffff00">How is this just now coming up?"</font>

212
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,161
<font color="#ffff00">She'd never been around another cat,</font>

213
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,999
<font color="#ffff00">and so I think she thought
she had made up her own language</font>

214
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,626
<font color="#ffff00">which consists of one word,</font>

215
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,089
<font color="#ffff00">which, of course, is "meow,"
and she uses it for everything.</font>

216
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,843
<font color="#ffff00">And here I was fluent the entire time.</font>

217
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,764
<font color="#ffff00">She was stunned...</font>

218
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,768
<font color="#ffff00">just as stunned
as a little kitten could be...</font>

219
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,980
<font color="#ffff00">Her mouth agape...</font>

220
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,901
<font color="#ffff00">her little paw in the air...</font>

221
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,071
<font color="#ffff00">her little microphone...</font>

222
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,661
<font color="#ffff00">Then, she meows at me, she meows...</font>

223
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,123
<font color="#ffff00">Here's the thing.
Let me explain something.</font>

224
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:20,127
<font color="#ffff00">I told this story once,
and Stephanie heard me.</font>

225
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,504
<font color="#ffff00">And she said, "After you say...</font>

226
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,133
<font color="#ffff00">'I says to her, I says,'
you should say,</font>

227
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,636
<font color="#ffff00">'She meows at me, she meows.'"</font>

228
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,431
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "Oh, that's not funny."</font>

229
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,518
<font color="#ffff00">She said, "No, I think it is."</font>

230
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,064
<font color="#ffff00">And I said,
"You do your thing, I'll do mine."</font>

231
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,781
<font color="#ffff00">And she said, "No, just please try it."
And so...</font>

232
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,241
<font color="#ffff00">I did a show one night...</font>

233
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,118
<font color="#ffff00">and I tried it.</font>

234
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,787
<font color="#ffff00">It bombed.</font>

235
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,248
<font color="#ffff00">I did it the night after,</font>

236
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,334
<font color="#ffff00">it bombed again,</font>

237
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,378
<font color="#ffff00">And then after that second show,</font>

238
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,423
<font color="#ffff00">I was just like, "All right, that's it.
I'm doing this every night."</font>

239
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,718
<font color="#ffff00">So she meows at me, she meows...</font>

240
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,472
<font color="#ffff00">"Meow!"</font>

241
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,349
<font color="#ffff00">Then I says to her, I says...</font>

242
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,017
<font color="#ffff00">"Meow..."</font>

243
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,811
<font color="#ffff00">We're going back and forth,</font>

244
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,106
<font color="#ffff00">having the time of our lives...</font>

245
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,692
<font color="#ffff00">and then Stephanie...</font>

246
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,404
<font color="#ffff00">leans out of the kitchen and says...</font>

247
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,490
<font color="#ffff00">"I wouldn't do that if I were you."</font>

248
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,368
<font color="#ffff00">"What?"</font>

249
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,371
<font color="#ffff00">"You don't know what you're saying to her.</font>

250
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,126
<font color="#ffff00">It could be rude...</font>

251
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,336
<font color="#ffff00">or inappropriate."</font>

252
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:52,094
<font color="#ffff00">No, I think Fluff and I are clear
on the fact that you're out of your mind.</font>

253
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,980
<font color="#ffff00">After a party,
we had some ribbons from some gifts</font>

254
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,607
<font color="#ffff00">that were strewn about the house,</font>

255
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,028
<font color="#ffff00">and Fluff really took to these.</font>

256
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,740
<font color="#ffff00">And at bed time, time she would grab</font>

257
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:16,368
<font color="#ffff00">about three ribbons in her mouth,</font>

258
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,456
<font color="#ffff00">and she would drag them
down the long hall...</font>

259
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:22,833
<font color="#ffff00">down the stairs...</font>

260
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,378
<font color="#ffff00">down the other long hall,</font>

261
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,548
<font color="#ffff00">and jump up on the bed and just be like,</font>

262
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,383
<font color="#ffff00">"There you go.</font>

263
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,719
<font color="#ffff00">Let's get some sleep now."</font>

264
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,723
<font color="#ffff00">And we were like, "Thank you, Fluff...</font>

265
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,855
<font color="#ffff00">We couldn't possibly get any sleep
without this pile of trash at our feet."</font>

266
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,193
<font color="#ffff00">Some nights,</font>

267
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,572
<font color="#ffff00">we would notice her little walnut brain...</font>

268
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,535
<font color="#ffff00">realize she'd forgotten
what we called her "night-night ribbons."</font>

269
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,704
<font color="#ffff00">And she'd be like, "Oh, hold on."</font>

270
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,208

being hauled down the...</font>

277
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,105
<font color="#ffff00">because she really believed
in her tiny little heart</font>

very clearly that's what was happening,</font>

Stephanie comes out of the bathroom</font>

<font color="#ffff00">and turns and just casually says,
"Careful of her neck.</font>

and Fluff was hanging...</font>

00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:38,695
<font color="#ffff00">I guarantee she wouldn't just be like,
"Oh, yeah, of course, you hung the cat."</font>

<font color="#ffff00">She'd be like, "You hung the cat?
Walk me through how you hung the cat."</font>

00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,039
<font color="#ffff00">All right. Well, I was standing here.</font>

313
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:52,042
<font color="#ffff00">I was dangling ribbons and...</font>

00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:03,345

She couldn't even grab it.</font>

318
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,478
<font color="#ffff00">the ribbons started to lower.</font>

319
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,983
<font color="#ffff00">And it started to wrap around her neck...</font>

<font color="#ffff00">It was four in the morning or so.
We were lying in bed.</font>

every couple of hours.</font>

00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:54,321
<font color="#ffff00">And these little things they sit in ,</font>

403
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,241
<font color="#ffff00">there's four tiny wheels underneath
and a plastic tray in front of them,</font>

404
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,995
<font color="#ffff00">and I somehow figured out</font>

405
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,706
<font color="#ffff00">that Finn loves</font>

406
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,251
<font color="#ffff00">when I kick his little car,</font>

407
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,171
<font color="#ffff00">and he shoots across the room
at a high speed.</font>

408
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:15,467
<font color="#ffff00">Then he scoots back towards me
and then I kick him again.</font>

409
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,137
<font color="#ffff00">Here's the problem:</font>

410
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,474
<font color="#ffff00">the entire front of our house
is just all windows.</font>

411
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,771
<font color="#ffff00">And there's a sidewalk
that runs along our house,</font>

412
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,899
<font color="#ffff00">and the neighbors are walking by,</font>

413
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,737
<font color="#ffff00">and all they saw was me kicking</font>

414
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,824
<font color="#ffff00">and this tiny little baby head flying
to the back of the house</font>

415
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,618
<font color="#ffff00">at a very high speed</font>

416
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,578
<font color="#ffff00">and then just...</font>

417
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,333
<font color="#ffff00">scooting back towards me
and then kicking again.</font>

418
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:52,504
<font color="#ffff00">And at that point, I just thought,
"Okay, I have to close these curtains."</font>

419
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,465
<font color="#ffff00">But then we just kept making memories.</font>

420
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,259
<font color="#ffff00">[sighs]</font>

421
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,636
<font color="#ffff00">Me and Finn.</font>

422
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,813
<font color="#ffff00">This is something where it's like</font>

423
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:14,442
<font color="#ffff00">I wasn't even really planning
on telling this story I'm about to tell</font>

424
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,486
<font color="#ffff00">'cause it happened so recently,</font>

425
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,531
<font color="#ffff00">but I also think it's amusing,</font>

426
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,117
<font color="#ffff00">and I'm also just like, "Who cares?"</font>

427
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,410
<font color="#ffff00">So...</font>

428
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,537
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, stick with me.</font>

429
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:27,664
<font color="#ffff00">Max and Finn...</font>

430
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,292
<font color="#ffff00">we used to push 'em down to the street</font>

431
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,628
<font color="#ffff00">where there was a lot of traffic
and we'd point out...</font>

432
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,671
<font color="#ffff00">[audience laughing]</font>

433
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,554
<font color="#ffff00">I did not say...</font>

434
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,100
<font color="#ffff00">we pushed our children into traffic.</font>

435
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,771
<font color="#ffff00">We pushed them down the hill
near the traffic.</font>

436
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,023
<font color="#ffff00">We stopped them just in time.</font>

437
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,651
<font color="#ffff00">We love them.
They're our precious baby boys.</font>

438
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,656
<font color="#ffff00">We would point out the cars.</font>

439
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,242
<font color="#ffff00">We'd say, "Car. Car. Car."</font>

440
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:08,079
<font color="#ffff00">And then Max started thinking
that cars were called car-cars.</font>

441
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,666
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.
Here's the other part of the story...</font>

442
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,753
<font color="#ffff00">that's gonna sound unrelated,
but hang in there.</font>

443
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,756
<font color="#ffff00">They were not breastfed.</font>

444
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,800
<font color="#ffff00">I can't help in that department.</font>

445
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,387
<font color="#ffff00">I tried my best, not successful.</font>

446
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,515
<font color="#ffff00">Stephanie didn't breastfeed them.</font>

447
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,477
<font color="#ffff00">I also don't know
why I'm telling you our personal details.</font>

448
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,899
<font color="#ffff00">Anyway, one day,
Max pulled Stephanie's shirt</font>

449
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,526
<font color="#ffff00">and saw down her shirt.</font>

450
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,906
<font color="#ffff00">They have not seen boobs in their lives.</font>

451
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,616
<font color="#ffff00">He was...</font>

452
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:51,873
<font color="#ffff00">Max stopped in his tracks,
just like, "What?"</font>

453
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,962
<font color="#ffff00">And then he looked up...</font>

454
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,465
<font color="#ffff00">and he said...</font>

455
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,511
<font color="#ffff00">"Car-car?"</font>

456
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,847
<font color="#ffff00">Just like as if to say...</font>

457
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,477
<font color="#ffff00">"I... I have very limited knowledge here.</font>

458
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,648
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know exactly what I'm looking at,</font>

459
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,567
<font color="#ffff00">but tell me, is that a car-car?</font>

460
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,031
<font color="#ffff00">Are those car-cars?!"</font>

461
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:29,035
<font color="#ffff00">So now that's of course what we call them
around the house.</font>

462
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,246
<font color="#ffff00">"Them," that's terrible.</font>

463
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:34,332
<font color="#ffff00">I'm talking specifically
about Stephanie's boobs.</font>

464
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,253
<font color="#ffff00">And everyone's.
They're car-cars, from here on out.</font>

465
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,172
<font color="#ffff00">I had no plan on telling that story.</font>

466
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:42,924
<font color="#ffff00">Okay.</font>

467
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,846
<font color="#ffff00">"Car-car?"</font>

468
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,932
<font color="#ffff00">"Yes, son. That's car-car."</font>

469
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,605
<font color="#ffff00">Max didn't say first words.</font>

470
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,983
<font color="#ffff00">He actually said first sentences.</font>

471
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,236
<font color="#ffff00">Very similarly to his mother,</font>

472
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,113
<font color="#ffff00">out of nowhere, no prompting,</font>

473
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,990
<font color="#ffff00">just across the house.</font>

474
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:09,284
<font color="#ffff00">Just...</font>

475
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,871
<font color="#ffff00">"Bob, I forgot."</font>

476
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,252
<font color="#ffff00">Stephanie and I were just like,</font>

477
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,880
<font color="#ffff00">"Did he just say, 'Bob, I forgot'?</font>

478
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,386
<font color="#ffff00">Who's Bob?"</font>

479
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,764
<font color="#ffff00">Let me tell you something, Bob.</font>

480
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,267
<font color="#ffff00">Max actually didn't forget.</font>

481
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,770
<font color="#ffff00">He's an infant. He has zero information.</font>

482
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:41,357
<font color="#ffff00">He panicked
because you were riding his ass so hard.</font>

483
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,485
<font color="#ffff00">Now get out of our house.</font>

484
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,821
<font color="#ffff00">You weirdo.</font>

485
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,998
<font color="#ffff00">A couple of months...</font>

486
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,708
<font color="#ffff00">a few months ago,</font>

487
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:03,212
<font color="#ffff00">he, again just out of nowhere, yelled...</font>

488
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,423
<font color="#ffff00">"I'm gay!"</font>

489
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,012
<font color="#ffff00">And I said, "We love you, son.</font>

490
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:14,182
<font color="#ffff00">We accept who you are, no matter what."</font>

491
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,812
<font color="#ffff00">And then a few weeks went by
and then again, "I'm gay!"</font>

492
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,442
<font color="#ffff00">"Listen, Max,
you don't have to keep coming out to us.</font>

493
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,528
<font color="#ffff00">We remember."</font>

494
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,870
<font color="#ffff00">Days before coming here, again...</font>

495
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,457
<font color="#ffff00">just, "I'm gay!"</font>

496
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:43,878
<font color="#ffff00">"Yeah, Max, the whole family's gay.
It's not a big deal!</font>

497
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,300
<font color="#ffff00">Except for Finn,
but even Fluff is bi-curious."</font>

00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:58,267
<font color="#ffff00">[chuckles]</font>

499
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:04,899
<font color="#ffff00">I'm well beyond my first words,
I'll be honest.</font>

500
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:11,322
<font color="#ffff00">You know what words I personally enjoy
are elongated words,</font>

508

<font color="#ffff00">explain to them
that you don't need maxi pads...</font>

when you've been shot in the crotch.</font>

512
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:53,114
<font color="#ffff00">explain to them that you have,
in fact, been shot in the crotch</font>

513
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:55,992
<font color="#ffff00">and that you are gonna
need maximum padding.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Let me know
how that conversation goes for you.</font>

00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,088
<font color="#ffff00">No, don't contact me.</font>

518
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:11,924
<font color="#ffff00">I'll call the Police.</font>

519
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,844
<font color="#ffff00">Not the authorities, but the band.</font>

of this very weird situation</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I... I'm not great with strangers.</font>

524
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,448
<font color="#ffff00">I was--</font>

525
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,700
<font color="#ffff00">I was at the airport,</font>

526
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,495
<font color="#ffff00">and I was on a travelator.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">You know what a travelator is, no?</font>

528
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,335
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not gonna tell you,
but what I will tell you is</font>

529
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:51,589
<font color="#ffff00">I was standing still
while moving forward.</font>

530
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:57,970
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, anyway,
so I was scooty scoot scooting along,</font>

531
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,515
<font color="#ffff00">travelating my face off.</font>

532
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,186
<font color="#ffff00">This guy was travelating towards me,
and he turned, and he said,</font>

533
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,313
<font color="#ffff00">"Yo, Tig, what's up?"</font>

534
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,190
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Oh, my gosh.</font>

00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,528
<font color="#ffff00">That is my favorite interaction

<font color="#ffff00">and I couldn't wait to share a glance
to acknowledge how funny that was</font>

537
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,076
<font color="#ffff00">so I turned around...</font>

540
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,087
<font color="#ffff00">that felt compelled
to be like, "Yo, Tig, what's up?"</font>

541
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:34,048
<font color="#ffff00">and then just travelate off
into the universe?</font>

542
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,304
<font color="#ffff00">I think about that man...</font>

we were always meant to be.</font>

547
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:04,954
<font color="#ffff00">Sometimes I imagine him in his apartment.</font>

00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,874
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know why I know</font>

<font color="#ffff00">that he cannot afford
a mortgage payment right now.</font>

00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,298

00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:19,760
<font color="#ffff00">just hanging out, watching TV...</font>

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,264
<font color="#ffff00">maybe I come on the screen...</font>

553
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:29,520
<font color="#ffff00">and he says, "Oh, yeah.
I saw her at the airport once."</font>

556
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,451
<font color="#ffff00">You know where I do thrive is actually
in large groups of strangers...</font>

I'm in heaven.</font>

00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,002

560
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,755
<font color="#ffff00">and together,
we do what we call our "party bits"</font>

00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,091
<font color="#ffff00">where we kind of mess with people
at parties.</font>

562
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,803
<font color="#ffff00">And so Henry had invited me
to meet him at this party.</font>

563
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:06,807
<font color="#ffff00">He was like, "I don't know anybody here."
And I was like, "Be right over!"</font>

564
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,731
<font color="#ffff00">As soon as I got there,
I walked over to the kitchen...</font>

565
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,192
<font color="#ffff00">and I looked in there,</font>

566
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,986
<font color="#ffff00">and there were five people just chatting,</font>

567
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,406
<font color="#ffff00">and I leaned on the door frame
and I said,</font>

568
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,618
<font color="#ffff00">"Hey... just so you know</font>

in, like, ten minutes."</font>

570
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,332
<font color="#ffff00">Then I just walked off.</font>

571
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,961
<font color="#ffff00">I had no idea if the owner of the house
was in the kitchen.</font>

572
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,005
<font color="#ffff00">So, I tell Henry,</font>

573
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,841
<font color="#ffff00">and he's like,
"Oh, my gosh.That's hilarious."</font>

574
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,053
<font color="#ffff00">And again,</font>

575
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,639
<font color="#ffff00">use any of this, just gives me credit.</font>

00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,852
<font color="#ffff00">[sighs] He said, "There's, like,
300 people in the backyard."</font>

577
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,021
<font color="#ffff00">And I was like, "Be right there!"</font>

578
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,234
<font color="#ffff00">So I walk out on the back patio</font>

579
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,361
<font color="#ffff00">and just yell,</font>

584
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,748

<font color="#ffff00">not even ten o'clock.</font>

586
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,423

I don't have to live there</font>

596
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,707

"How can I help?"</font>

672
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,649
<font color="#ffff00">Okay, I know what this looks like.</font>

673
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:17,071
<font color="#ffff00">It probably looks
like the Indigo Girls aren't here.</font>

674
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
<font color="#ffff00">But...</font>

675
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,329
<font color="#ffff00">I'm tapping them on the shoulder
right now.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Do you think I can make that up?</font>

677
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,126
<font color="#ffff00">Folks, I can't make this up.</font>

678
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,505
<font color="#ffff00">I love when comedians say that.</font>

680
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:39,927
<font color="#ffff00">Like, "Why are you bragging
that you're bad at your job?"</font>

681
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:45,808
<font color="#ffff00">But seriously, they-- they're--
I just looked over at them,</font>

682
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:48,602
<font color="#ffff00">and they're standing there like this
with their guitars.</font>

683
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,981
<font color="#ffff00">Do you think I can make that up?</font>

684
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,485
<font color="#ffff00">No, that's something
from what I actually saw.</font>

685
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,866
<font color="#ffff00">Who here is like...</font>

686
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,413
<font color="#ffff00">"I don't think the Indigo Girls are here"?</font>

687
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:17,339
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sorry, but you think
the Indigo Girls are not here</font>

688
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,674
<font color="#ffff00">and that I'm just...</font>

689
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,510
<font color="#ffff00">Really?</font>

690
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,929
<font color="#ffff00">Well, let me tell you.</font>

691
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,974
<font color="#ffff00">The brunette broke one of her strings</font>

692
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:30,602
<font color="#ffff00">and had to go off and fix the broken--</font>

693

<font color="#ffff00">What? Listen. I'm tell--
I'm trying to tell you--</font>

694
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,985
<font color="#ffff00">I'm trying to keep you up-to-date
with the news here of what's going on.</font>

695
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,612
<font color="#ffff00">But partly, what's funny to me is that...</font>

696
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,991
<font color="#ffff00">I know what their names are.</font>

697
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:48,746
<font color="#ffff00">And it's kind of funny to me
to call her the brunette.</font>

698
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,039
<font color="#ffff00">I know her name.</font>

699
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,751
<font color="#ffff00">And she is back here.</font>

700
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,920
<font color="#ffff00">But you guys think--</font>

00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,839
<font color="#ffff00">You think I've made up</font>

<font color="#ffff00">the Indigo Girls are here.</font>

704
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,806
<font color="#ffff00">The Indigo Girls who were...</font>

705
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:13,520
<font color="#ffff00">nominated for a Grammy in 1989...</font>

706

<font color="#ffff00">yeah...</font>

707
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,611
<font color="#ffff00">as best new artist
and lost to Milli Vanilli,</font>

00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,658
<font color="#ffff00">But ended up winning the Grammy
the following year.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">But listen,
you think they're not back there.</font>

711
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:35,584
<font color="#ffff00">Who here-- Don't get an attitude with me
like, "Yeah, that's right. We don't."</font>

712
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,670
<font color="#ffff00">Who here is like...</font>

713
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,674
<font color="#ffff00">"I actually kind of think
they might be here."</font>

714
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,057
<font color="#ffff00">Wait a minute, so you think...</font>

715
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,896
<font color="#ffff00">that I'm gonna do an entire set,</font>

716
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,106
<font color="#ffff00">I'm gonna do my show...</font>

717
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,234
<font color="#ffff00">and then... [clears throat]</font>

718
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:05,656
<font color="#ffff00">the Indigo Girls
are gonna show up at the end</font>

<font color="#ffff00">and perform for you?</font>

720
