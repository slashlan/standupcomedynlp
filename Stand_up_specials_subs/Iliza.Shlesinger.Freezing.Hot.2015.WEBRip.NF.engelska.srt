1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,763
[techno music playing]

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,849
We're in Denver. I have what
I'm hoping is altitude sickness

3
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,143
and not some, like,
weird form of meningitis.

4
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:21,188
They keep telling me it's not meningitis,
but they don't know.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,564
We've got an amazing crowd.

6
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:25,442
All the tickets are gone,
which is great. All fans.

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,529
People who are coming to my show
should expect a healthy dose

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:31,406
of very honest, hilarious,
aggressive comedy.

9
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,826
The special's called Freezing Hot,
so the set is freezing hot.

10
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:38,163
There's a big old explosion
in the background, palm trees and snow,

11
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,041
and then there's a surprise at the end:
my girl Blanche.

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,627
When I first started traveling,
I decided to get her

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,838
so I'd have someone to be with me
on the road, and fans like her.

14
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,048
Come here!

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,638
Okay, thank you. We have to go
make an hour special.

16
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:58,183
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Iliza Shlesinger!

17
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:02,104
[cheers and applause]

18
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:08,193
[techno music thumping loudly]

19
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,536
Thank you!

20
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:18,829
Denver!

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,455
[audience cheering]

22
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,207
I picked... I picked this city.

23
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,669
I picked this city as my favorite city
to do comedy in, for this special.

24
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,171
- Thank you.
- [cheers and applause]

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,552
Thought it was gonna be a lot colder.
Really did.

26
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:36,221
I always feel like weather is
something you can use

27
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,223
to ingratiate yourself toward other girls.

28
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:42,227
Guys have sports, when they meet:
"What's up, bro? You see 30 for 30?"

29
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,105
"Fuckin' right, I did. Yeah."

30
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,816
[laughter]

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,112
With girls, it's not fashion
or anything else, it's the weather.

32
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,574
It's like, "Oh, my God, it was so hot.

33
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,702
Like, earlier."

34
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:04,249
And then the other girl's like,
"It was so hot! I noticed that, I feel.

35
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:08,795
I love it when it's hot, but not too hot.
Do you know what I'm talking about?"

36
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,007
"I know what you're saying.
Like, I totally get it. But not too hot.

37
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,717
But I also like it when it's cold."

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,638
"Me too, but not too cold, no.
If it's too cold, it's like, brrr."

39
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,139
[laughter]

40
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,974
I like to talk about the weather.

41
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:26,480
But the weird thing for being a girl
is even if you live in cold weather,

42
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,233
girls always have an issue with deciding
what outer layer we should wear.

43
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,361
We always defer to the guy.

44
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,779
Like, "Babe!

45
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,990
Should I do a jacket?

46
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,325
[laughter]

47
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,495
Jacket?
A short one?

48
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,080
A long one?

49
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,623
You're not looking? Okay.

50
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,166
[laughter]

51
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:49,669
If I should do a jacket. For the...
Are we going to the thing? [bleats]

52
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:50,753
[laughter]

53
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,382
Do a jacket? Should I do it?
Should I do a jacket?

54
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:56,676
Will you just pause Halo
for two seconds? Thanks.

55
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,097
Jacket... should I do it?
Should I do a jacket? Not a jacket.

56
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,100
Should I just do, like,
four scarves and no pants?

57
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,768
[laughter]

58
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,311
Seems counterintuitive.

59
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,605
Do a jacket? Jacket?
Jacket? Jacket?"

60
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,234
Finally her boyfriend's like,
"Yeah, bring a fuckin' jacket!"

61
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,362
And you're like,
"I don't want to bring a jacket!"

62
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,742
- "Why not?"
- "'Cause then I have to carry it!"

63
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,620
Girls hate the idea of carrying a jacket.
"It's too heavy!"

64
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:27,624
The female body is capable
of carrying a human being...

65
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,378
for nine months, but apparently
a lightweight jacket

66
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,339
stuffed with feathers
is where we draw the line.

67
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,550
[laughter]

68
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,510
"Should I bring a jacket?"

69
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,721
In your 20s,
you never bring a jacket.

70
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,557
Some of you are in your 20s,
so remember, like, yesterday?

71
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,350
Do it.

72
00:03:45,434 --> 00:03:49,187
In your 20s, you never brought a jacket.
You're invincible and a little stupid.

73
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,564
"I don't need one."

74
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,025
That's why it's so funny for those
over 30 to watch 20-year-olds

75
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,528
at, like, 2:00 a.m.,
like, braving the cold.

76
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,780
[laughter, cheers]

77
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,323
Shivering.

78
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,159
[cheering]

79
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,245
Doing this shit with their dresses.
Like, pulling it down.

80
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,748
All those shoes cracking
under the pressure.

81
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,040
"My dress won't..."

82
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,585
"You're not wearing a dress!
It's a tube sock!"

83
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,795
[laughter]

84
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:15,297
You always rationalize it.

85
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,466
"It's not that far
from the car to the bar."

86
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,261
In your 20s, you risk that icy walk for
the glory of not having to wear a jacket.

87
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:23,472
You have no problem
with that two-minute walk.

88
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:28,477
Not every girl makes it. I've lost
many a hot Amber to that walk.

89
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,228
You're like, "Where's Amber?"

90
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:33,148
Amber's frozen. Like, "Go!

91
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,818
Order a lemon drop
and toast to my memory!"

92
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,614
It's the worst when you're cold,
you can't find your car.

93
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,058
If you're with a group of girls,
resign yourself to the fact

94
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,243
you're probably
not going to find your car.

95
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:49,122
Even if you're brilliant, there's
something in the genetic makeup of women

96
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,292
that disables us from remembering
where the car is parked.

97
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,753
It's rare that a woman
parks the car and is like,

98
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,506
"Boop! Okay, I'm in spot 4-F.
Let me remember that.

99
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,176
Let me be responsible
for my choices in this life.

100
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:05,347
Something disengages and takes over,
and we're just like, "Boop! What's this?"

101
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,184
- [blows]
- [laughter]

102
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,146
And then we just, like,
wake up in a Sephora.

103
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,484
Always bring at least one guy.

104
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,529
There's something in the male makeup.
Men always find the car.

105
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:23,406
They throw down breadcrumbs,
Hansel and Gretel-style.

106
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,117
Maybe they've got
a tracking device in their junk.

107
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,036
I don't know. Like, ping, ping, ping!

108
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,830
He may not even find your car.

109
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,707
He will find you a car,
and you'll get in it.

110
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:37,629
Guys, I'll tell you a secret: We don't
want to look for the car. It's boring.

111
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,590
If I do a scan and I don't see it,
I'm like, "Someone stole it!"

112
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,010
That's always the go-to. "Stole it!"

113
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,683
Sometimes we'll act like we're stressed,
even if we're not. That's our go-to.

114
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,977
Women have been told
they're feebleminded.

115
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,688
Once in a while,
we'll play into it to our advantage.

116
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,691
"I don't know where the car is, okay?
I'm sorry!

117
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,986
You're perfect! And I don't know
where the car is.

118
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:05,615
I don't even... I don't know where
the car is, okay? I'm trying, okay?

119
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,955
I'm stressed out because I'm working,
like, ten hours a week.

120
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,500
- And I'm like...
- [laughter]

121
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,087
There's the car.
Thank you, Officer, we found it.

122
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,423
Like your jacket."

123
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,551
Girls always defer to the guy
when it comes to weather questions.

124
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,470
Every girl's done this,
where you wake up in the morning,

125
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,723
next to your husband,
your boyfriend,

126
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,809
or whatever Dairy Queen manager
Tinder has set you up with.

127
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,561
[laughter]

128
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,939
8:00 a.m., first thing out of your mouth,
you're like,

129
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,443
"Babe... is it cold outside?"

130
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,238
And your boyfriend wants
to be there for you.

131
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,491
He's like, "I don't know
'cause I'm inside."

132
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,703
[laughter]

133
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,748
"It's chilly. Chilly."

134
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,043
Girls hate being cold. We hate it.
Girls don't like to be chilly.

135
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:01,963
Guys, don't let your date get cold.
We're not happy when we're cold.

136
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,549
"Come here, babe.
I gonna warm you up."

137
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,844
"Don't fucking touch me.
It's not what I want."

138
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,847
Girls don't want to have sex
when they're cold.

139
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:13,767
In my life, I've never been like,
"Oh, my God, I'm so cold,

140
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,061
I just wish I had somebody to fuck!"

141
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,604
It doesn't really happen.

142
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,440
[laughter and scattered applause]

143
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,985
We don't get horny when we get cold.

144
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,822
It sends a message to our brain:
Time to go home. Time to hibernate.

145
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,576
Time to watch a show on TLC about
a 600-pound woman eating herself to death.

146
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,954
That's what we want to do. "Cold!"

147
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,225
Don't let your date get cold.
We're not happy when we're cold.

148
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,770
The body language for "I'm cold"
and "I'm fucking pissed at you"

149
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,546
is the same body language.

150
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:47,008
Girls don't like being cold...
but we love cold weather.

151

That's girl logic for you.

Everything's a contradiction wrapped
in a bow. "It gets pretty. Glitter."

153
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,726
It's the same thought process
that's like,

"I'm gonna wear tight pants,
but don't you look at my butt!"

"I am so cold, I'm sweating.

It is freezing hot in here.
I don't know. I don't know how I feel."

All girls love fall.
I don't know if you know that.

All girls are required to love fall. Yeah.

- Required. That's right.

went to the girl counter.

They hold your girl card up.
"What's your favorite season?"

162
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,962
And you go, "It's fall, motherfucker."
And they're like, "All right.

163
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:28,049
Here's your girl card, your uggs,
your glitter. Go have fun, be insecure."

You don't even have to tell girls
when it's fall. We know.

Oh, we sense it.

The second it turns fall,

173
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,406
the second a leaf falls somewhere
in, like, Connecticut, we feel it.

Sit at home, watching TV.

175
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,369
Outside the temperature
drops from, like, 86 to 63.

176
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,497
We pop out of the ground like gophers.
We sense that fall is here.

177
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,167

in Los Angeles."

"Fine. I'm going to the grocery store
and throw apples at children. Something!"

We go on Pinterest,

Leaves, that's a fun thing
we like to fuck with.

191

Every year the leaves change color,
and we lose our shit.

and now they're brown!"

They're not brown.
They're fuckin' dead, you sicko!

They're fuckin' dead, and you're
doing crafts with their corpses.

Have you no respect for nature?

That was a living thing, you monster!

your fiancée has already planned
your entire wedding on Pinterest.

We should do a chocolate waterfall.

Instead of chocolate,
we should do bridesmaid's tears.

298
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:08,699
What are they? They're small plates.
You do, like, five to ten per person.

299
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,703
It runs you about 100 bucks each.
Totally worth it. Yeah."

300
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,498
Girls love anything small,
not filling, and expensive.

301
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,042
We would eat diamonds if we could.

302
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,754
"They're tapas. They're small plates.
It's Spanish. What Spanish?

303
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,216
It's, like, their Spanish, not
the country below the United States.

304
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,219
It's a different Spanish.
It's got a fucked-up 'th.'

305
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,347
I went to Spain for two days
when I was 16, so I'm cultured, okay?

306
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,852
They're small plates. Platito.

307
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,313
They're so small,
it's like a Frisbee for a rat.

308
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,274
Like, small plates.

309
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,527
It's like a monocle for an amoeba.
Just, like, really small.

310
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,529
One time I ate the plate,
on accident.

311
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,283
That was pretty horrific.
Small plates."

312
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,494
It's an absolute joke.
I don't like anything about it.

313
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:57,373
Comes on a wooden block,
like you're eating lunch at Home Depot.

314
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,710
Some guy, with his bare hands,
balls up some ham in the corner

315
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,045
and then throws some shards
of manchego cheese

316
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,340
and some haphazard drizzle of honey
so you can eat like an Andalusian farmer

317
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:10,136
taking a lunch break in a field in 1830
for, like, a hundred bucks. Cool.

318
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,930
[cheers and applause]

319
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,101
"Small plates."

320
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,645
One friend gets annoyed
you don't want her suggestion.

321
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,691
"You don't want tapas? Fine.
Just trying to accommodate the group."

322
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,946
Guys don't ever get tapas.
It's a girl food.

323
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,157
"You wanna get tapas?"
It's never dudes.

324
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,243
"Now, look, bro! Wanna get tapas?

325
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,873
We'll go after fantasy draft.
You wanna do tapas?

326
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,751
We'll get one meatball,
split it with four dudes, no homo."

327
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,424
"You don't like my suggestion?
What do you want?

328
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,343
Do you want to do a flatbread?

329
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,138
You want to do a flaahbread?

330
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:57,975
What is it? It's like a thin crust pizza,
but, like, annoying."

331
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,270
It's always the one girl in the group
that suggests the flatbread.

332
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,898
"Do you guys want to do it
for everyone, a flatbread?"

333
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,742
She's the one suggesting it.
She's the one that got everyone together.

334
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,320
She's the one that printed the Groupon.

335
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,490
Her name is usually something
like Amanda.

336
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,702
"You want flatbread? Do you? You do?

337
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,747
Not eating? Don't do gluten?
Not doing dairy? You don't do fun?

338
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,333
Sleeping? That's weird. We're in public.

339
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,671
Do you want flatbread?
Ask her. Does she want flatbread?

340
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,798
I can't. My phone's dead.
I can't text her.

341
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,969
Ask her if she wants flat...
Do you want flatbread?

342
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm asking if you want a... [quacks]

343
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,806
[laughter]

344
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,392
[mouthing softly]

345
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:43,271
[quacks] Aflac!
Do you want flaahbread?

346
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:46,983
Ask Cynnamon with a Y
if she wants flatbread.

347
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,445
Then tell Kinnamon with a K
her name is not phonetically sound. Okay.

348
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,947
I'm gonna do the ordering.

349
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,409
Hi! We're in a rush
because we're entitled.

350
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,702
Um...

351
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,582
Wanna do one flatbread
for the 40 of us, yeah?

352
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,561
She's not eating, she's gonna have a bite,
doesn't do dairy, doesn't do gluten,

353
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,629
she doesn't know what gluten is, but feels
like she doesn't do it this week.

354
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,340
And we're gonna do...
What do you guys want to drink?

355
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,758
No, don't order your own.

356
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:16,387
We're just gonna do
a trough of white wine. Yeah?

357
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,680
How do you want to drink it?

358
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,474
You're being annoying. Stop.
No, we don't need glasses.

359
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,102
[demonic voice]
We're just gonna drink it with our hands!

360
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,355
What do you guys want to get on it?

361
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,857
Let's just go crazy.

362
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,568
Let's do half goat cheese, half air.
Thank you!

363
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,362
[Aflac duck's voice] Flaahbread!"

364
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,742
Went on a date recently. Uh...

365
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:39,827
I made a real effort in my 30s.

366
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,455
I'm 31. Made a real effort
to try to date normal guys.

367
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,207
When you're in your 20s,
you can date whoever you want.

368
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:48,210
You'll live forever, you're hot,
you're in your 20s.

369
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,671
"Wanna go out? We're both
carbon-based. Let's do it."

370
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,590
And it's, like, fine.

371
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,884
Tried to make responsible choices
in my 30s.

372
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,179
Recently I went out with someone
based on the way he was dressed.

373
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,806
He was an accountant.
[retches] But, okay.

374
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,100
I'll carry the conversation.
That's fine.

375
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,269
[laughter]

376
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,108
He had a plaid shirt,
tucked into khakis. Okay.

377
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,819
All right. Little nerdling.
That's okay.

378
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,781
Cell phone in a holster on his hip.

379
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,282
[laughter]

380
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:20,409
Dad-style.

381
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,579
To the dads in the audience
and subsequently watching this,

382
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,165
what text is coming in so fast

383
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,251
you have to have your hand ready
O.K. Corral-style?

384
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,590
And then what are you
sending out so fast

385
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:37,134
that it's rendering your
cellular device smoking,

386
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,220
and you've got to holster it?

387
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,642
The point is, he was dressed responsibly.
Nonthreatening. Nice, like an adult.

388
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,143
I knew I had to respond in kind.

389
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:49,980
I couldn't dress like a 19-year-old
lesbian Hot Topic manager. I get it.

390
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,609
Made a real effort, folks.
I made a real effort.

391
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,070
Asked my girlfriends
that are in their mid-30s...

392
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,239
Dating awhile, very mature, right?

393
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,532
"What should I wear?"

394
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,992
"You need to get...

395
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,786
like, a silk blouse.

396
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,332
So, just wear it and, like,
cover that shit up and just tuck it in,

397
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,084
blouse it out, silk blouse."

398
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,545
I'm here to say right now,
I reject a silk blouse.

399
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,630
Fuck a silk blouse, okay? Yes!

400
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:18,300
Just because you're not 20 doesn't mean
you have to be ashamed of your body.

401
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,594
I don't need to wear a tent over it, okay?

402
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:25,433
They're burkas for American women.
I said it and I meant it. All right?

403
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:29,353
They're oppressive, ugly, hot, shapeless,
and if you wear an underwire bra

404
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,772
under your silk blouse
and you sweat through it,

405
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,150
it's gonna look like a face
with its eyes closed.

406
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,568
[laughter]

407
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,945
Fuck a silk blouse.

408
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,574
But I bought one anyway.
I'll be like, whatever.

409
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,661
Went to a nice store. Made a real effort.
I went to a Nordstrom...'s.

410
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,874
I asked the sales girl...
She was 19, and just hot.

411
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,334
- "I need a silk blouse."
- "What about this one?"

412
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:55,254
It was white.
It had black splotches all over it.

413
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,006
She was like, "It's abstract."

414
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:00,843
I was like, "Yeah, like a Rorschach test,
but less interesting."

415
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,636
She's like, "I don't get it."

416
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,848
I'm like, "That's 'cause
you work here. Okay."

417
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,725
"No, it's like a fun pattern."

418
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,728
I'm like, "That's a cow print.
Like, one hundred percent.

419
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:14,648
It's black splotches. I'm gonna look
like a model for Gateway printers.

420
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,192
I'm not wearing that."

421
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:20,070
Here's the fact: it's a cow print.
You can't wear it if you're normal.

422
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:23,073
If you're a model, you can wear
something stupid and look hot.

423
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,618
You can wear a blousy cow print
and be like,

424
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,245
"Fuck yeah. Moo, motherfuckers. Unh!

425
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,290
Unh! Moo, yeah, unh!

426
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,958
Unh, right?"

427
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,835
[laughter, applause]

428
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,879
Not dicks, udders.

429
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,051
Normal girl wearing a cow pattern,
if you tuck in a blousy cow,

430
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:46,055
you're gonna look like a cow that had
gastric bypass surgery. Just blousy.

431
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:50,017
Tucked-in blousy cow, so I got it.

432
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,189
Tucked-in blousy cow.
Then I bought pants that were very tight.

433
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,649
You want to wear tight pants.

434
00:21:56,732 --> 00:22:00,110
The tighter the pant, the more effort
it shows you've put into it, okay?

435
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,779
Not unlike Chinese foot-binding,

436
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,907
you want your pants so tight
that they form your muscles and bones

437
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,203
into this kind of, like, palsy effect.
Okay?

438
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,289
And you want to have shoes
that are so high, the heel is so high,

439
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,708
that you are literally
cantilevered off the edge

440
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,419
and it forms a dainty hump
in the back.

441
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,756
Men like this, trust me.
Men love a good hump, okay?

442
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,675
Like this. So you're ready.

443
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,885
So you've got blousy cow, palsy pants.

444
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,598
You want your shoes so high that you
can't run from your rapist if you want.

445
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,893
Blousy cow, palsy pants,
and I was ready for the date.

446
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,229
I brought a special bag.

447
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,440
There's a special bag women
are required to carry on a first date.

448
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:40,317
It's called a clutch.

449
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:44,029
Small mouse purse.
A clutch, for those that don't know,

450
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:47,575
is neither a synonym for the word "cool,"
nor does it have to do with a car.

451
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:52,037
A clutch is a tiny purse
that women carry on a first date.

452
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:54,873
The reason we carry it
is because we can't carry a big bag,

453
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,584
'cause men don't like big bags.

454
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,085
First, it's not attractive.

455
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,297
You can't show up to a guy's house going,
[husky voice] "Hey! Huh huh.

456
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,425
Ready for our first date, Steve?
Well, I just brought my...

457
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,718
[thuds]

458
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:09,138
...bag right here. We don't gotta go
to no fancy dinner or nothing.

459
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:13,267
Nope, I brought me a hot plate.
We can just plug it in right here.

460
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,146
We can do it on the lawn, unless
you're ashamed of me. [chortles]

461
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,982
You got an external power source?
Maybe a generator?

462
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,359
I call mine Jenny. It's a little joke.
We could...

463
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,737
Do you like beans, Steve?
I brought beans.

464
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,239
I don't need a can opener.
I've got this shit."

465
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,325
[imitates whirring can opener, splutters]

466
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:36,415
[cheers and applause]

467
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,711
We carry the little bag
because men don't like big bags.

468
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,213
Men don't like big bags
because big bags scare men.

469
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:45,633
You show up with a big bag,
guys' first thought is,

470
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,594
"Fuck, she's trying to move in."
That's the first thought.

471
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,766
Men don't like surprises. They're already
weirded out by women in general.

472
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:57,102
They don't know what's in that bag.
You could have guns, medication.

473
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:01,690
"What's in the bag? What's in the bag?
What's in the bag!

474
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,070
Tampons, alimony papers,
Gwyneth Paltrow's head?

475
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,946
What's in the bag?"

476
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,282
[laughter, applause]

477
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,953
Could have medication in there,
restraining order.

478
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:18,332
Taking around that garbage with you,
that's why it's called baggage.

479
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,294
So we carry a little, tiny clutch,

480
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,588
carry a tiny bag to fool you.

481
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,217
We want you to think all this perfection...
I said perfection!

482
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,387
Comes from the contents
of this tiny rat purse.

483
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,139
"Just a couple of things."
Every girls' told that lie.

484
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:37,893
"It takes me, like,
ten minutes to get ready, so..."

485
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,020
As you're telling the lie,
you can feel it.

486
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,815
"I promise, I'm telling the truth.
[retches] It's fine.

487
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,317
Ten minutes."

488
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:49,863
And no woman in this room
has ever closed a clutch on the first try.

489
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,951
Because... it's true.

490
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,327
[scattered applause]

491
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,372
"It was hard getting here.
It wouldn't close on the first try."

492
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,416
Because when women
pack for a first date,

493
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,710
we don't pack for the date
we're going to have,

494
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:05,504
we pack for the date we want to have.
Imaginations take over.

495
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,549
"I should bring one lip gloss
for every degree the sun sets,

496
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,969
'cause we're gonna watch
the sunset from the yacht. Do it.

497
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:14,763
Also, bring my AAA card,
in case his Porsche breaks down.

498
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,267
He has a Porsche. [gasps]
What if he's, like, a secret millionaire,

499
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,270
and he, like, wants to make sure
that, like, I love him for him

500
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,647
and not his money,
'cause he's had problems

501
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,316
with other girls in the past
wanting him for his money,

502
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,777
and he didn't know if their love was pure?

503
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,238
I'll pretend, like,
'You don't have to test me, '

504
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,200
but he does, because I really like money,
but I'm gonna pretend it's not a big deal.

505
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,078
And maybe he's the prince
of a recently liberated country

506
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:41,498
that I don't care about,
and I should pretend I care about him,

507
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:43,709
so I should plan
for this date to be amazing,

508
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,670
so I should bring a passport
in case we go to dinner in Paris."

509
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,885
You get it all in the bag,
start to zip it.

510
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,679
You've got it in your teeth, the zipper.
Fuckin' close! Please!

511
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:57,890
You get it, like, halfway zipped.

512
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,602
You can't go on a date with a bag
zipped halfway. That's ratchet.

513
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,605
So what do you do?

514
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,066
You take everything out, all your
accessories, you lay 'em all out.

515
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,653
You gotta make some cuts.
So sorry, ladies.

516
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:15,657
You're all very valuable to the team.
Not everyone can make varsity.

517
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,704
And rather than get rid of anything,
right, what do you do at least once?

518
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,082
You make an attempt to put
everything back in the bag,

519
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,876
but slowly...

520
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,380
thinking if you're somehow
purposeful in your actions,

521
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,550
you will sneak up on the bag...

522
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,720
and it won't know that it's full.

523
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,348
And you get it down to one thing,
and then you snap.

524
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:43,685
You're like, Fuck it! Everything goes in!
LUNA bars, Activia, uggs, Dad issues.

525
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,978
Let's go.

526
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,064
[imitates thudding footfalls]

527
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,612
So we went to a bar,
and we're sitting there,

528
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:58,033
and we sit down, and he ordered
one drink... the whole night.

529
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,369
Here's my problem with that. Um...

530
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,371
[laughter]

531
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:06,166
It was a Friday night, and I'm a lady.
I want to party, but I'm a lady.

532
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,753
So, if you only have one drink, that means
I'm only going to have one drink.

533
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:13,966
If I only have one drink, how the hell
am I supposed to want to touch you later?

534
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,718
- [laughter, cheers]
- Okay?

535
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,804
Yes. Thank you for being honest.

536
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,099
Do the math on that one,
accountant. Yeah.

537
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,810
Anyone not laughing,
you're lying to yourself.

538
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,687
That's what alcohol is for.

539
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,982
Loosen yourself up a bit. Make choices
you wouldn't normally make.

540
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,942
"Whatever. I had some wine. It's okay."

541
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,111
Otherwise, why waste the calories?

542
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,573
Let's all just have a glass of warm milk
and punch ourselves in the face.

543
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:41,368
[laughter and scattered applause]

544
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:45,163
He didn't even get alcohol.
He had a beer. He had, like, an IPA.

545
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,501
And he had, like, taken a sip of his.
I was done with my vodka soda.

546
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:51,211
I thought we were having a race.

547
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,882
Sipping on his beer,
I'm down to the ice in my drink,

548
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:58,093
tonguing it like a dog on a hot day.
Just like...

549
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,974
I'm running into the bathroom,
taking shots of Scope from the attendant,

550
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,935
trying to get, like, a prison buzz,
introduce alcohol.

551
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,563
I'm holding my breath,
trying to get some kind of high.

552
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:14,109
My problem wasn't necessarily
that he only had one drink.

553
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,945
My problem with it, really,
was that I had a problem with it.

554
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,989
I should have been mature about it.

555
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,033
And had I been dating more in my 30s,

556
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,577
I think I would have been okay
with that situation.

557
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,496
My friends in their mid-30s,
they'd be okay with that drink.

558
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,291
I wish that I was. I wish I could
have normal girl thoughts.

559
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:32,252
I wish I'd sit and have the drink
and have normal girl thoughts.

560
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:34,671
"This one drink is really nice.
I'm so grateful.

561
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,840
This is great.

562
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,550
He seems like a really sweet guy.

563
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,887
He's got really nice eyes.
I wonder what they'd look like in a jar."

564
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,680
Like, normal thoughts.

565
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,849
[laughter, applause]

566
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:50,520
But I'm still of the mindset
that when I get a drink in me,

567
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,690
it sends a message to my brain...
[demonic voice] that it's go time!

568
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:55,651
That's what it says, all right?

569
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,071
[cheers and applause]

570
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:02,658
I'm 31, I'm not 90. It was Friday,
not a Tuesday during high tea.

571
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,535
Let's make some fucking mistakes.
That's what it's about.

572
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:06,828
I got...

573
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,249
[cheers and applause]

574
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:15,087
I feel a lot of people are wired this way.

575
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,924
A sip of liquor sends a message to
my party goblin that it's time to do it.

576
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,302
Some people have party goblins
that have lost their ability to walk,

577
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:24,763
from partying too much.

578
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,307
My party goblin sleeps on a bunk bed,
on the top bunk.

579
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,227
My dignity sleeps on the bottom bunk.
He is not invited.

580
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,480
The second I taste liquor, it wakes
her up. She smells it in my brain.

581
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,566
She's dreaming of eating frozen pizza,
'cause she's a monster.

582
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,611
[muttering, snorts] "Huh?"

583
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,530
[laughter]

584
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,659
"Vodka. Top shelf."
[grunting]

585
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,203
She goes to the megaphone
that controls my actions.

586
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,205
We've all had party goblin control
our actions.

587
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,624
[gruff voice] "You need to rage!

588
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,168
Find the door guy!
Ask him if he has drugs!

589
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:58,046
Do not specify.
See what he comes up with!

590
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,548
[laughter]

591
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,967
Do it! Fuckin' go!

592
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,177
Jump on top of that table.

593
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,888
Start dancing. There is no music.
I will provide the music.

594
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,891
♪ La la la la la la-la-la la! ♪

595
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,561
You look so pretty.
Jump off that table. Run outside.

596
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,105
Push that cop,
see if he finds it adorable.

597
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,356
[laughter]

598
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,942
Ask if you can touch his gun.
The answer's always no.

599
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:21,236
[blows raspberry]
Go over to that CVS.

600
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,572
Find the dairy aisle.
Grab some whipped cream.

601
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,450
Do some Whip-its.
It might kill you. It's fucking worth it.

602
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:29,077
Go outside. Take a picture.
Put it on Instagram.

603
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,205
Take it down ten minutes later
'cause, oops, we could see your nipple!"

604
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,915
Like, that's how it usually is.

605
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,751
[cheers and applause]

606
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,969
So, we left the bar, right?

607
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:49,473
Super buzzed off of our drink.

608
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,852
And he drove me home, so now
we're in front of my house, okay?

609
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:57,147
We're sitting in front of my house.
This is where a kiss takes place.

610
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,066
This is where a first kiss takes place.

611
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,818
Now, as a girl, you know
when you've put out the vibe

612
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:05,447
that you want a kiss, all night, okay?
Men and women are wired differently.

613
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:09,576
Men are putting out the vibe all the time.
Right now, lot of vibes, all the time.

614
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,622
"God, I hope she sees my wiener."
That's what...

615
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,835
The vibe is ever-present with guys.
"You want this? Yeah?

616
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,338
Anyone? Anyone. No?

617
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,716
Little bit?
What, you're calling the cops?

618
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,009
Okay.

619
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:30,055
See you on Facebook. Okay."

620
00:31:31,098 --> 00:31:34,309
For girls, we're very specific
about when we put out the vibe.

621
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,978
Can't just throw that shit around.
Got to be specific.

622
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,272
Every girl's got things
she does to throw out the vibe.

623
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:40,982
Maybe touch her hair a little bit.

624
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,318
"That's funny." [titters]

625
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,986
Maybe you show off part of your body.

626
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:47,864
Every girl's got that one body part
better than any other girl's.

627
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,992
Maybe it's your forearm.
Maybe all night, you're like, "Fuck, yeah.

628
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,452
[laughter]

629
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,830
Yeah? Ehh?

630
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,916
You want it? You wanna fuck, eh?

631
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,043
Yaaahhhh.

632
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,461
That's weird? Okay."

633
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,463
[laughter]

634
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,591
When a girl knows that a guy's
a little vulnerable and into her,

635
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:09,052
we become like an evil witch
in Enchanted Forest,

636
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:12,264
and the guy becomes, like,
the lost ingénue.

637
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,974
Say your girlfriend broke up with you.

638
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,144
Let's say you were cheated on.
You're a little wounded.

639
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:19,354
You're sitting there.
"I hope I find a girl."

640
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:22,190
And we, out of nowhere,
are just like... [raspy voice] "Hello.

641
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,276
[laughter]

642
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,569
Apple?

643
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,529
[laughter]

644
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,073
What's that?
Yes, I used to work in a pharmacy.

645
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:34,411
[laughter and scattered applause]

646
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,541
Whole new life for myself."

647
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,710
We start saying things to you
to lure you in.

648
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,130
"Yes, this way.
Sports? I love sports. This way.

649
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,674
This way. Come this way. Oh, yes.

650
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,301
What? A relationship? Not me.

651
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:53,388
No, I just want to fuck in perpetuity
until you grow tired of me. This way!

652
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,016
Yes, what's that? Your ex-girlfriend?

653
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:00,312
She sounds like a bitch I would love
to fight with my shirt off. This way.

654
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,024
This way to my gingerbread house.

655
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,193
Yes. Yes.

656
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:10,197
Come and nibble on the walls
of my gingerbread house. Yes!

657
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,699
What's that? Yes,
it's a metaphor for my vagina.

658
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:16,411
You're very clever.
This way. This way.

659
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,914
[whoops and applause]

660
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,084
[whistling, cheering]

661
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,378
Said the right things,
did the right things.

662
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,714
I knew we were gonna have
a mouth kiss.

663
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,424
Now, for the guy...

664
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,220
he has to decide
how he wants to kiss the girl.

665
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:37,140
That's a tough role. You have
to decide how you're gonna kiss a girl.

666
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,726
If you kiss her too soft,
you look like a big puss.

667
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,187
If you kiss her too hard,
charges will be filed.

668
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,105
So you have to be careful.

669
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,858
In this interaction,
the girl also has her part to play.

670
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:50,862
There are only three places you can look
in the passenger side of a vehicle,

671
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,073
only one of which is
truly acceptable, okay?

672
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,201
You cannot look right at him.
That's too much eye contact.

673
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,537
He might take it as a threat.
He might bite your neck.

674
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,957
We don't know what he'll do.
Okay? We don't know.

675
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,626
Plus, it's creepy.
"Do I kiss this girl? I don't know."

676
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,711
And you're just like... [snorts]

677
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,880
[laughter]

678
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,636
[laughter]

679
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,807
But you can't stare out
your passenger side window.

680
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,102
That's not enough eye contact,
and you'll look touched in the head.

681
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,397
He's looking at you.
"Do I kiss this girl?"

682
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,941
And you're just like...

683
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:30,068
[laughter]

684
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,823
[laughter]

685
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,910
[sings high note]

686
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:44,124
Side note, ladies: If his window
does this, do not date him. Okay.

687
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,383
So the girl only has one option,

688
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:57,220
and that is to sort of look down
and stare at her hands,

689
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:00,599
and all of a sudden become fascinated
with her cuticle situation.

690
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,769
"Amazing. I used to have feathers.
That is so weird."

691
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:08,148
And sort of monitor the impending kiss
out of your periphery.

692
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,067
And when he gets about halfway,
you strike.

693
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,821
Teeth first, so you know
that he knows you mean business.

694
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,451
I've kissed two guys.
I think I know what I'm talking about.

695
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:23,246
So I was all set.
Blousy cow. Palsy pants.

696
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,291
Fuckin' forearm. Creepy witch.
Like, I was all set.

697
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:30,086
I knew we were gonna have a mouth kiss,
and apparently he had a different plan.

698
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,672
- He had a cheek peck planned.
- [sympathy moans]

699
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,924
And I did not see that coming.

700
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:37,886
Now I'm going to show you
what happens when a cheek peck

701
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,263
meets the intention of a mouth kiss.

702
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,765
This is me, and this is him.

703
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,267
"I'm just sitting here.
Oh, my God. Nails."

704
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,480
[laughter]

705
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:52,192
[laughter and applause]

706
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,865
Let's see the slow-motion replay.

707
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,660
[slurring speech]

708
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,913
- [laughter]
- Huh?

709
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,706
No?

710
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,750
Fuck!

711
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:13,546
Tuck and roll!

712
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:17,050
[cheers and applause]

713
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,514
So embarrassing!

714
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,224
It was so embarrassing.

715
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,477
It was sexual rejection, like,
in the weirdest form.

716
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,604
I don't even remember
how I got in my house.

717
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,481
I just know that I ended up there.

718
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,484
What I think happened is that
my embarrassment materialized

719
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,152
into a magician's smoke bomb.

720
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:39,948
And I was just like,
"This never happened!" And I was gone!

721
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,368
So now I'm inside my house.

722
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,453
We've all had this happen.
It was, like, 10:30.

723
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,539
We've had this happen
where you come home

724
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,083
earlier on a weekend
than you thought you would.

725
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:53,586
You were all planning to go out,
and you come home way earlier.

726
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,463
Guys, they want to go back out, right?

727
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,800
You wanna get back out there, right?
Go team.

728
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,053
Get back out there.
You want to get drunk and meet chicks.

729
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,140
For girls, it's a different motivation.
"Why don't you want to go back out?"

730
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,060
"'Cause I don't wanna waste an outfit."

731
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,062
You try to contact your friends.

732
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,357
There's something energywise
that makes it very difficult

733
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:18,570
when you're sober to go back out
and rejoin your drunk friends.

734
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,573
You ever try getting a location
from your drunk friends?

735
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,908
It's like texting with a house cat.

736
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,706
They send you the weirdest stuff.
Here's what happens.

737
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,251
They don't really care if they see you
because they went out together.

738
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:37,255
You went rogue. You went off on a date,
selfish, went to go find love.

739
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,174
Your friends formed a little mini-mob,

740
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,593
and they band together
and they formed a phalanx.

741
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,180
"Let's find dudes,"
and they went out together.

742
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,058
They don't care if they see you.
They send you weird texts.

743
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:53,396
Like, "We don't know the name of the bar!
We don't know how long we'll be here.

744
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,233
We're in outer space. Come find us!"

745
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,821
After, like, 20 minutes of trying,

746
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,532
you resign yourself to the fact
you're gonna be home.

747
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:08,161
What's the first step?
You take off your going-out clothes.

748
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,206
I had a silk blouse on.
I didn't know how to care for it.

749
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,167
I didn't know what to feed it.
I didn't know.

750
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,463
It's the fanciest material. It's like
the caviar of the material family.

751
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,548
I stood by open French windows
for ten minutes

752
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,259
waiting for bluebirds
to come and undress me.

753
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:25,929
[laughter and applause]

754
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,099
Took it off.
Put on my at-home clothes.

755
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:32,227
Girls know what at-home clothes are.

756
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,230
The clothes you put on
when no one else is around.

757
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,148
Super gross.

758
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,943
All the guys here are like,

759
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,087
"I've been with my girl when we're
by ourselves. She's super cute."

760
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:43,321
No, we don't do that.

761
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,824
We don't wear roll-down boxers
and socks up to here

762
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,034
'cause you're kind of
a pedophile, and pigtails.

763
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,954
We don't do that when we're by ourselves!

764
00:38:52,956 --> 00:38:56,584
Girls, we dig deep into the trunk of,
like, old T-shirts.

765
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:01,339
You pull out your T-shirt from
middle school. It's got paint on it.

766
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,758
You got your Abercrombie
varsity athletic pants

767
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,677
from, like, 1997, stripes on 'em.

768
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,387
You put those on, right?

769
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,516
Sweatshirt's got holes. Pants have holes.
Underwear has holes. Socks have holes.

770
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,311
Why are there holes in your clothes?
Because tears corrode.

771
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,146
[laughter]

772
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,984
[scattered applause]

773
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,486
And you wander listlessly
through your house.

774
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,907
You look homeless, but you're in a home,
so that doesn't make sense.

775
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:29,576
You wander from room to room.

776
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,786
You're just kind of not ready
to go to bed yet.

777
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,122
You go to a room where
the light's off. You flip it on.

778
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,417
One percent of you is expecting
there to be, like, a serial killer.

779
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:41,212
Knowing full well if he's there,
you're done for,

780
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:45,884
'cause you're in your at-home clothes.
Nothing's... can't defend yourself.

781
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,511
Flip it back off.
You wander into the kitchen.

782
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:51,014
You don't really
make a meal for yourself, do you?

783
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:53,766
You just stick your hand deep
in a bag of deli turkey.

784
00:39:56,603 --> 00:40:00,148
Right? Couple of crackers.
Maybe, like, two Starbursts for dessert.

785
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:05,278
Staring at nothing. Maybe
you have a show in the background.

786
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,907
Maybe Frasier's on,
hypothetically me every night.

787
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,661
Sitting there eating. You start
saying weird things to your dog.

788
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,622
"One day, you'll be my wife."

789
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,877
I'm sitting there doing this.
Phone buzzes.

790
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,171
It's a text message.
Who's it from?

791
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,381
The accountant.
[gasps]

792
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,760
What does it say? Is he gonna
ask me out again? Does he like me?

793
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,720
"Hey, Iliza, had a great time tonight.

794
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,473
Would love to have kissed you,
but I have to be up early."

795
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,147
I don't even know
how to answer that like a human.

796
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,858
You sent me a text
that is un-text-backable.

797
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,862
And first of all, who are you
making out with, wolverines,

798
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:50,990
that your legs are immobile the next day?

799
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,700
You send me something that stupid,

800
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:57,580
I'm not giving you the dignity
of a normal text back.

801
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,791
[cheers and applause]

802
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:04,003
You're not even getting back a regular
emoji. No winky face. No sad face.

803
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,089
I'm going deep into that emoji bank

804
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,633
and I am pulling out... fried shrimp.

805
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,886
[laughter]

806
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,013
[mouthing silently]
Fried shrimp.

807
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,353
What bothered me about the whole thing
is it was sexual rejection,

808
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,063
no matter how you slice it.

809
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,483
I wasn't saying, "Let's get married.
Let's make plans to meet my mom."

810
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,653
It was a kiss. And so,
even though you denied the kiss,

811
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:32,281
it's still denying me sexually,
which is very uncomfortable for girls.

812
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:34,951
Guys get sexually rejected,
it's part of being a guy.

813
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,120
"You want it? Nope? Okay.
Anyone else? Hey?

814
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:40,832
One over here. Dick over here.
Penis over there. One, two, two, two.

815
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:45,169
Sold! To the seven in the corner
with low standards."

816
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,467
It was a mouth kiss. You rejecting that
is the equivalent of you

817
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,387
being like, "Hey, Iliza!
You see this? None for you!"

818
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,139
[blasts]

819
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,561
Let's talk about this for a second.

820
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:05,565
I talked about this on my last special.
Every girl's seen a guy do this.

821
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:13,031
So, I've done some thinking
on the topic of this...

822
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:15,742
I want to let you girls know,
'cause girls get offended.

823
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:19,787
"That's so gross. Why are you doing that
at a family picnic? What are you doing?"

824
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,250
I want to give you peace of mind
and let you know,

825
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,127
it has nothing to do with you.

826
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,130
He would be doing this
whether you were there or not!

827
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:33,092
[laughter and scattered applause]

828
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,887
Take it as an insult,
take it as a compliment.

829
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,805
I don't have an issue that guys do this.

830
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,975
My issue is that there's
no reciprocation on the female end.

831
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,686
Gentlemen, you'd be very upset...

832
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,813
if you were laying in bed,
ready to have sex,

833
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:48,191
game's on pause, ready to go.

834
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,777
And your girlfriend came
out of the bathroom

835
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:52,904
in just a T-shirt and no bottoms.

836
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,198
"Hey, babe."

837
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,242
And she just did some sort of, like,
weird vaginal puppetry.

838
00:42:58,326 --> 00:43:00,536
[laughter]

839
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,004
Hashtag vaginal puppetry.

840
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,840
[laughter]

841
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,927
You'd be very upset if she just
came out and was like, "Babe!

842
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,221
Hey.

843
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,057
[whispers] Hey."

844
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,018
[laughter and applause]

845
00:43:28,231 --> 00:43:32,652
If there are any guys here not laughing,
that's how we feel about that!

846
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,202
It would disrupt the entire cycle
of human procreation.

847
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,079
Men would cease having sex with women.

848
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,374
They'd be super grossed out.
They'd move to the woods.

849
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,002
They'd take raccoons as wives.
It would be horrible.

850
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,881
What's weird about it is, as a girl,

851
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:57,552
you are open to the threat
of a guy doing this at any point.

852
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,180
If you're dating a guy, he could do it
a week in, a year in, ten years in.

853
00:44:01,264 --> 00:44:03,641
It could be in the bedroom,

854
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,977
at a concert, the produce aisle.

855
00:44:06,102 --> 00:44:08,396
This could happen at any minute.

856
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,481
That fear is ever present in your mind,

857
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,776
so I think if men and women
are to ever be fair and equal,

858
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:16,821
guys should have
an inherent fear of raptor vag.

859
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,284
Hashtag raptor vag.
[rasps]

860
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,578
It's only fair.

861
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,288
So I have a plan.

862
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:28,708
Tonight, we strike.

863
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,793
[laughter]

864
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:34,797
[women whooping, cheering]

865
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:38,801
Every guy in here on a date
is like, "Jesus. Fuck.

866
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,596
Why did we buy tickets for this?
They were free? Still."

867
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,602
Here's my plan, okay?
Tonight...

868
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,395
while my boyfriend is sleeping...

869
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,023
Let me take it back.
I'm gonna get a boyfriend.

870
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,608
[laughter]

871
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,444
Wait till he's sleeping, okay?
Sneak up in there...

872
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,447
And when you do this,
'cause you're going to do it, pinky swear?

873
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,909
When you do it, you want to make sure
that he's in REM sleep.

874
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,411
It's the deepest,
most luxurious sleep, okay?

875
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,747
You need to check
to see that he's in REM sleep.

876
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,166
How do you make sure
someone's in REM sleep?

877
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,627
You open their eye...

878
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,047
while they're sleeping.

879
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,175
You ever do this to someone
while they're sleeping?

880
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,719
Fuck you guys! I'm not
the only one that's done this!

881
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,221
[laughter, applause]

882
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:30,394
And you say things like, "I love you!
Look back and forth if you love me too!"

883
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,941
Make sure he was sleeping.
So he's sleeping.

884
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:37,902
And I go into the other room,
and I would pin for a little bit...

885
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,029
Pin pin pin...
And then I would go in,

886
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:42,740
and I would take out
my raptor claw, okay?

887
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,535
And I would sharpen my nails down,
not to a point that was sharp enough

888
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,413
that you could stab a meerkat
and eat it if you wanted to,

889
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,708
but you want a rounded point
so the pressure will be localized, okay?

890
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,460
Like an apex of sorts, okay?

891
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,878
Rounded.

892
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:59,799
Like, if a raptor went to get a manicure,
she'd be like, "Make it lovely."

893
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:05,221
So I'd make it lovely, and I'd sheath it
for my own protection,

894
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,432
and I'd go in, and I'd descend
upon the sleeping boyfriend,

895
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,935
and I would apply the raptor claw
to his cheek,

896
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,521
and I would gently stroke.

897
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,774
Not enough to awaken,
but merely to stir.

898
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,860
Okay? Why am I doing that?

899
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:23,364
I'll tell you, what I'm doing
is introducing external stimuli

900
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,241
into his land of slumber.

901
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,534
Who talks like that?

902
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,537
I'm introducing external stimuli
into his subconscious,

903
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,622
thus permeating his dreams, okay?

904
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,333
Whatever he's doing in his dream,
he's gonna feel this.

905
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:38,129
Somewhere in the back of his brain,
he's gonna be, "Oh, shit, raptor vag."

906
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,802
Doing this lets him know.

907
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:46,971
It's not unlike
when you're having a dream.

908
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,932
Let's say you're talking to a model,
and your alarm clock goes off.

909
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:52,226
"Another reason
I don't like to wear underwear..."

910
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,853
[imitates alarm clock buzzing]

911
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,771
It's the equivalent of that, okay?

912
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:00,484
I would do this, so in his dreamland,
he would feel that and he would know.

913
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:03,195
And then, he's still sleeping,
but he's feeling this,

914
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,072
and then, for the final stage,

915
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:09,160
I would sneak up to him,
and I would sound the raptor mating call.

916
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,455
It would resonate all throughout
the land of Nod, and he would know.

917
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:16,792
He's in his dream, delivering his naked
high school commencement speech,

918
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,629
he would hear the raptor mating call,
and he'd be like, "Oh, fuck, Mama's here."

919
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:22,131
He would know.

920
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,886
I'd get in his ear and do the raptor
mating call right before I striked, okay?

921
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,471
I stroked? I striked.

922
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:30,890
I stricked? Okay.

923
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:34,393
Do it. I'd get in his ear,
raptor mating call.

924
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,355
[guttural clicking]

925
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,858
And he would, "Huh?"

926
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:44,028
And I'd go... [screeches]
"That's right, motherfucker!"

927
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,280
[laughter and applause]

928
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:52,119
[cheering, whistling]

929
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,500
It's like a jacket.

930
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,506
Girls are weird. We do weird things,
but we're cute, so it's okay.

931
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,134
Girls do crazy things.
It's our own brand of crazy.

932
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:09,553
Guys do crazy things too,
like rape and war.

933
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:13,766
They do their own kind of crazy things.
Girls have a more insidious kind of crazy.

934
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:17,520
We'll start a fight just to see if we can
make it look like you started the fight.

935
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:23,025
We have do it three times a year
or we lose our standing in the club.

936
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,904
Every girl's done that,
just to see how strong your powers are.

937
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,031
"I don't want to fight with you. Stop it.

938
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,829
I didn't start this. You started this,
you started acting weird.

939
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,039
- I don't want to fight with you."
- "Bullshit."

940
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,833
"I don't want to fight with you."

941
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,711
We'll turn around, talk to a fake jury.
"I don't... What is this?

942
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,590
I don't want to fight with you.
This is on you.

943
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,300
I'm peaceful, you're being a dick.

944
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,678
I don't even... stop it.
What are you doing?

945
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,139
You're yelling.
I don't want to fight with you."

946
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:59,478
But in your girl head, you're like...
[bellowing laughter]

947
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,232
[demonic voice] I wanna...
[imitates thudding footfalls]

948
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:06,152
I wanna fight with you.

949
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:11,198
I woke up feeling chubby this morning...

950
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,161
and that is somehow your fault.

951
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,747
Get in the Octagon.

952
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,002
We do all kinds of head games.

953
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,671
"Go hang out with your friends.
That's fine.

954
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:31,260
Do it. Go hang out
with your friends. I dare you.

955
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,222
I know you made plans with me.
That's fine.

956
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,684
Go hang out with your friends.
That's fine. I want you to be happy.

957
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,520
Do it. Go hang out with your friends."

958
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:46,233
[demonic voice]
There are no friends. Only Zuul.

959
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,111
[cheers and applause]

960
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,368
Look, I'm sure being a guy
has its difficulties.

961
00:49:56,452 --> 00:50:00,122
I haven't been one in a while.
I don't really know what that's like.

962
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:03,417
Girls have a lot of stuff that are
being thrown at them all the time,

963
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,463
and we have to suss out what's good for us
and weed out the positive messages.

964
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,217
I truly believe our society operates
on a currency of women's insecurities,

965
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,594
multibillion-dollar industries
thriving on,

966
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,514
"Just make them feel their bodies are
unacceptable, then sell them some shit."

967
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,016
Look at any magazine.

968
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:21,810
"You're amazing, but you need
to lose, like, ten pounds.

969
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,145
Love your body, love your hair.

970
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:26,023
Whatever you've done is wrong.
You look like a sea monster."

971
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:30,444
Everything's got a weird mixed message
and a "whorey" undertone.

972
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,154
"Be a bad girl. Own your sexuality.

973
00:50:32,238 --> 00:50:34,823
But if you fuck more than one dude,
you're a whore."

974
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,575
Like everything's wrong.

975
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:40,621
You can't just go around effing dudes,
but you can have sex with more than one.

976
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,458
Even my eyeliner has a sexual message.
It's called Bad Gal.

977
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,086
Fourteen-year-olds can buy this.
Are they bad gals?

978
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,880
[sinister voice] Yeah, tiny bad gals.

979
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,591
It comes with a little devil
that sits on your shoulder.

980
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:54,760
It whispers salacious things in your ear.

981
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:58,222
- Oh, I'd better get ready for the...
- [gruff voice] "You're a bad gal."

982
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,601
Better close that window.
Better get ready...

983
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:05,104
[gruff voice]
"Yeah, you wanna fuck in a Dumpster."

984
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,605
What are you talking about?

985
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,612
Doesn't sound like a bad gal as much as
someone that just needs a home.

986
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,864
I'm not a bad gal.
I'm just trying to put on eyeliner

987
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,826
so I don't look like
newborn hamster face.

988
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,036
- "Yeah, you're a bad gal."
- I'm not a bad gal!

989
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,539
"You are. You want to give
a hand job in an Acura

990
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,000
going 50 in a 30, no insurance.

991
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,626
You're a bad gal."

992
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,295
What are you talking about?

993
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,131
I have insurance.

994
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,970
What's my blush called?
Flirty Girl.

995
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,472
[gruff voice]
"Yeah, tart it up, you hooker!

996
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,350
Yeah! Look super horny,
ready to go.

997
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:47,146
You're a flirty girl.
Dressed like that, you're asking for it!"

998
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:49,898
Dressed like what, like a cool mom
out on mom's night out?

999
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,442
Dressed like what?

1000
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,402
"Yeah, you wanna fuck in a Dumpster!"

1001
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:55,321
What's with you and fucking
with Dumpsters?

1002
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:58,032
- "I wanna fuck in a Dumpster."
- Well, you're projecting!

1003
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,037
Again, my issue with it isn't that
there's a sexual undertone.

1004
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,581
My issue is that it's
a negative message to women,

1005
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,624
but guys reap a positive effect, right?

1006
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:09,918
"She's a bad girl.
Maybe she'll touch my D."

1007
00:52:10,002 --> 00:52:12,504
That's pretty much the message
coming out of that.

1008
00:52:12,588 --> 00:52:15,799
"Maybe she'll wear spiked leather gloves,
yeah, on a motorcycle!"

1009
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:19,428
She's probably a lesbian
if she's on a motorcycle.

1010
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,929
"Bad gal."

1011
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,849
There's no men's products,
there are no men's products

1012
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:27,561
that have a negative message to men,
but women reap a positive effect.

1013
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,189
There's no guy putting on cologne,
and he's hearing,

1014
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:33,150
"You're gonna text her back
within a reasonable time frame."

1015
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,159
There's no guy putting on aftershave,
and he's hearing,

1016
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,621
"You're 37 and share a room with two
other dudes in the hipster part of town.

1017
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,416
Outside the context of Los Angeles,
that's totally socially unacceptable.

1018
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,502
What's that? You run
a T-shirt making business?

1019
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,712
You only have online shit?
No real T-shirts.

1020
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,882
You ride a bike to work
and claim it's ecologically responsible,

1021
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:01,428
but we all know your credit is so fucked,
you can't get financing for a Kia!"

1022
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:04,681
[cheers and applause]

1023
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,189
There's a lot to contend with as a girl.
We have different rules.

1024
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,483
Girls are like,
"We can fuck whoever we want."

1025
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,945
That's not the way it should be.
We're the fairer sex for a reason, lady.

1026
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:21,740
If you want guys to pay for dinner
and open doors, act like a lady.

1027
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,326
You can't act like a guy.
We're just not built for it.

1028
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:28,080
Sorry if that's crushing some of you.
It's just the truth. "Fuck!"

1029
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,804
My girlfriends called me the other night.

1030
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:33,419
"Do you want to go out with us...
after your skit?"

1031
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,463
[laughter]

1032
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:39,967
Continuing to not fully comprehend
what I do for a living. That's fine.

1033
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,761
We're talking about it,
and in the back was my drunk friend.

1034
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,680
Drunk friend never gets to hold the phone.

1035
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:48,100
Drunk friend's always in the background,
yelling shit at the sober one.

1036
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,937
Drunky's always tethered
to the sober one. Like, "Ahhh!

1037
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,149
I miss you! Aaahhhh!"

1038
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,819
When they yell, "I miss you,"
and you don't miss them,

1039
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,864
you're like, "Miss you too, babe. Bleh."

1040
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:04,366
"Come out with us!"
She kept yelling at me.

1041
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,994
"Come out with us!
I'm gonna fuck a stranger!"

1042
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,787
[laughter]

1043
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:10,289
I'm sorry, do whatever you want.

1044
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:13,709
I feel if you're a lady, that is never
a sentence that should be uttered

1045
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:16,253
with anticipation, in future tense.

1046
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:20,632
It is only a sentence that should be said
with the utmost abhorrence, in past tense.

1047
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:23,135
It should never be,
"I'm going to fuck a stranger!"

1048
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:26,597
It should always be,
"Oh, my God, I fucked a stranger!

1049
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,348
[laughter and scattered applause]

1050
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:29,641
Oh, my God!"

1051
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,813
We always talk about the downside
when girls sleep with someone.

1052
00:54:34,897 --> 00:54:37,191
Let me take up for the guys'
side for a second.

1053
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,276
I do believe there are
plenty of guys in here

1054
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,361
that have gone to bed
for a one-night stand,

1055
00:54:41,445 --> 00:54:43,655
thinking, "I've found someone special."

1056
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:46,575
And then you wake up the next morning
next to a fat water rat.

1057
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,953
These things have happened, okay?
Plenty of guys in here, I'm sure,

1058
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:53,165
thought they went to bed with,
like, an absolute angel,

1059
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,875
and tomorrow morning...

1060
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,212
Tonight you're gonna go out
in Denver on a Friday, meet a girl.

1061
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,214
"Oh, she's so angelic, so beautiful."

1062
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,133
And tomorrow, you are going
to wake up next to Satan himself.

1063
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,178
You're gonna look down
at your pile of sheets,

1064
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,764
and they'll just be, like,
undulating, pulsating,

1065
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,933
and there'll be heat lines
coming off of it.

1066
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,310
[sizzling, hissing]

1067
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:16,772
"Uh, good morning.
Excuse me, is it... Stacy?"

1068
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:21,401
[demonic voice]
"No one by the name of Stacy is here."

1069
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:22,986
[laughter]

1070
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,073
"I'm so embarrassed.
I thought your name was Stacy."

1071
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:31,411
"El nombre no es importante."

1072
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:34,915
"Wow. Well, judging by that
and the smell of sulfur,

1073
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,668
I'm gonna take a guess
that you are... Satan?"

1074
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,711
"Yes!"

1075
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,256
Clip-clop.

1076
00:55:43,924 --> 00:55:44,925
"Yes?"

1077
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,218
"Uh, look, you gotta go."

1078
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,388
"Why? I thought we were gonna
get breakfast, smoochie-pie."

1079
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,681
[deep chuckle]

1080
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:55,686
"Uh, we can't get breakfast, because,
look, I cheated on my girlfriend, and I..."

1081
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,609
"You what? You cheated?
You cheated on me?"

1082
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,777
"Are you crying lava?"

1083
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,113
"Fucking right, I'm crying lava!

1084
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,365
I'm the devil, what do you think
I'm gonna cry?

1085
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:11,285
That's so fucked up.
I thought you were a good guy.

1086
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:12,578
Fuck you, fuck you!"

1087
00:56:12,661 --> 00:56:13,870
"Just get outta here."

1088
00:56:13,954 --> 00:56:16,873
- "I know when you're gonna die."
- "Are you fuckin' serious?"

1089
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,209
"Nope, that's the angel of death.
I'm just kidding.

1090
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,129
People think we're the same,
but we're not.

1091
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,381
We're just similar height,
we both have brown hair."

1092
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,966
[laughs]
Um...

1093
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,092
"You gotta go."

1094
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,553
"Don't fuckin' touch me!
Get off my tail! I'm going.

1095
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:33,098
Give me some bus fare.

1096
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,517
In my hoof.

1097
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:38,061
What are you laughing at?"

1098
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,356
"I'm sorry, I think it's ridiculous
that you're taking the bus."

1099
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,817
"Yes, I'm taking the bus, okay?

1100
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,736
I am fiscally responsible.

1101
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,364
Do you know how hard it is
to be the devil? I have no business.

1102
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:52,909
The Kardashians take, like,
all of my business. I'm not even joking.

1103
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:55,412
It's really hard to earn
an honest dollar, okay?

1104
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,955
[laughter, cheers]

1105
00:56:57,039 --> 00:57:00,959
I had to have sex with Kris Jenner
and everything. It was horrible.

1106
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,920
She's evil.

1107
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:07,549
Of course I don't have any money.
Of course I take public transportation.

1108
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,510
I'm a demon of the people, okay?

1109
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:14,181
What do you expect me, to drive
around in a hearse made of skulls, okay?

1110
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,559
I'm not Rob Zombie.
I'm not an asshole, okay?

1111
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:20,312
Now, give me six dollars and 66 cents

1112
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,147
and I'll be on my way."

1113
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,399
"All right, fucking go."

1114
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,777
- "I have a question."
- "What?"

1115
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,654
"Is it cold outside?"

1116
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,990
[laughter, cheers and applause]

1117
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,916
You guys are a wonderful crowd.

1118
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,084
Uh...

1119
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,753
there's no elegant way
to wipe off a sweat mustache.

1120
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,047
[laughter]

1121
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,385
[chuckles softly, blows raspberry]

1122
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,886
I was talking at the beginning

1123
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:56,390
about how a lot of my friends are
getting married, and I'm happy for them.

1124
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,601
I think that I'm just in a different
head space at the moment.

1125
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,354
They all get really excited
to plan their weddings,

1126
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:05,565
and I get really excited
to plan a breakup.

1127
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,820
Guys, hear me out on this.
Girls do weird things.

1128
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:14,992
And from the day we start dating you,
we keep tabs on everything you do wrong...

1129
00:58:16,284 --> 00:58:18,829
so that if and when we decide
to break up with you,

1130
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,748
'cause, I don't know,
if the wind changes direction...

1131
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,417
[laughter]

1132
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,712
we can then refer to said list,
extrapolate one isolated incident,

1133
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:31,216
and use that as the pièce de résistance
of our breakup masterpiece.

1134
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:34,011
You ever been dating a girl,
everything's going great...

1135
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:36,638
Things are mediocre,
not great, but whatever...

1136
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:39,099
And she breaks up with you
out of the blue?

1137
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,185
"Yes, your feet look like eagle claws!
There, I said it. Cacaw.

1138
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,273
Cacaw. Goodbye."

1139
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,735
It seems like it's out of nowhere.
We let things build.

1140
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,279
You could be sitting
at your anniversary dinner.

1141
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,032
- "I'm thinking about getting salmon."
- "I'm fuckin' done!"

1142
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:57,492
Like it doesn't really matter.

1143
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:01,246
I'm not cavalier about this.
I put time and effort into these breakups.

1144
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,875
You put time and effort into dating me,
I'm going to return said time and effort,

1145
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:08,670
plus interest... it's a very good ROI...
On that breakup, okay?

1146
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,630
These are handcrafted breakups.

1147
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:14,676
Hand-hewn, "hecho en California,"

1148
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,971
tailor-made, forged from the fires
of your own insecurities,

1149
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,307
specialty breakups, okay?

1150
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:22,017
I don't do a generic breakup.

1151
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,727
I don't do a breakup template.

1152
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,522
I don't do the whole,
"Oh, my God, it's me, not you."

1153
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,817
No, it's you, motherfucker,
here's a list of reasons why.

1154
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,361
[cheers and applause]

1155
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,867
I was dating a guy,
we dated for three months,

1156
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,786
and we were on our first date, right?

1157
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,621
We're doing first date stuff, right?

1158
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:46,666
We're at a bar, drinking, talking,
taking muscle relaxers.

1159
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,795
I was asking him first date questions:

1160
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:53,799
What do you do, where are you from,
what do you max out at?

1161
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,511
I was like,
"Oh, what's your middle name?"

1162
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,931
"What's your middle name?"
He goes, "My middle name is Paul."

1163
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,475
- [shrilly] Now...
- [laughter]

1164
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,520
reciprocity in, like, a normal
conversation would dictate

1165
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:10,232
that perhaps his next question to me
should have been...

1166
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,858
[indistinct responses]

1167
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,486
"What's... what's your nah nah nah."
That's right!

1168
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,862
[laughter]

1169
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,155
What's your middle name?

1170
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:19,449
But he never asked me my middle name,

1171
01:00:19,533 --> 01:00:22,994
and I fuckin'...
[demonic voice] remembered that.

1172
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:25,163
[laughter]

1173
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:28,834
'Cause here's the deal: He wasn't
necessarily wrong in not asking me that.

1174
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,752
Men and women communicate so differently.

1175
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:34,589
I'm surprised we can be in the same room
without ripping each other's genitals off.

1176
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:37,509
If you said to him,
"Why didn't you ask her her middle name?"

1177
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:41,096
He'd be like, "At the time, she had
long hair. I thought she was a mermaid."

1178
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,515
Like, not even in the same stratosphere.

1179
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:46,226
[laughter]

1180
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,730
What's crazy is every guy in this room
is like, "Mermaid hair. I get it."

1181
01:00:52,274 --> 01:00:55,318
And where I went wrong,
where girls tend to go wrong,

1182
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:57,404
is I didn't tell him why I was mad.

1183
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,658
We don't tell you why we're mad, because
"you should know," which is insane.

1184
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,119
We barely know why we're mad.

1185
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,872
"I don't know, but something happened,
and now I'm mad.

1186
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:11,418
I don't know why I'm mad, but you should.
The secrets are locked in my brain."

1187
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:14,588
"Did you eat a key?"

1188
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:18,675
"I did. That and the plate
and the leaves from earlier. I feel fat."

1189
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,181
We just sit there, stoic,
with this, like, Stepford wife facade,

1190
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:27,559
and we let it rot our brains,
and we sit there smiling, but it devolves.

1191
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,812
"He didn't ask my middle name.
He doesn't want to get to know me,

1192
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:34,900
my hopes, thoughts, dreams, feelings,
friends, family, we'll never have a baby."

1193
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:37,694
Like, that's the way that devolves.

1194
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:40,238
[scattered applause]

1195
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:42,782
So I began planning the breakup...

1196
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,035
on the first date.

1197
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,329
We dated three months,
and at the conclusion,

1198
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,333
I decided I wanted to do a rain breakup.

1199
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:56,004
Felt the rain would be emblematic
of the tears shed during the courtship.

1200
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,840
Rain breakup.
Wanna break up in the rain.

1201
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,968
Oh, my God. Unh. Rain, right?

1202
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,933
All different kinds of rain breakups.
You can do one in an alley, crying.

1203
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:09,184
You could be a young, British country girl
in the 1800s, running through a field.

1204
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,645
"No! I can't! I can't be!"

1205
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,146
In a white dress, no shoes.

1206
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,565
Women weren't allowed
to wear shoes until 1962. Fun fact.

1207
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:20,278
"No! I can't be with you! I've been
betrothed to another, Jeremiah!"

1208
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,571
"Why? I love you so."

1209
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,865
"No!" Running in the rain,
and it's cascading.

1210
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:26,660
I've got long hair.
They didn't have scissors back then.

1211
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,954
I'd wrap it around like a belt.
It's weird.

1212
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:32,749
I'd be running, and it would cascade
over it, white, so it's just see-through.

1213
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,043
You wouldn't see areola,
but you'd see nipple bumpage.

1214
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,338
Like Rachel, Friends, circa 1997.

1215
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,215
Network nipple, right?

1216
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:42,300
Running, fuckin' doing it.

1217
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:43,802
No bra. Running hard.

1218
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,846
'Cause in your fantasy, your tits
are like rocks. Just running.

1219
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:48,932
"Aahhh!"

1220
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:51,851
Every girl has fantasized
about kissing a boy in the rain,

1221
01:02:51,935 --> 01:02:55,105
which, if you've ever actually done it,
is horrible. You will get the flu.

1222
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:58,668
I live in Los Angeles.
That's not clean rain.

1223
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:01,111
That's fucking rats, cabbage,
headshots, lettuce.

1224
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:02,570
[laughter]

1225
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:05,740
Kale. Three types of leafy greens.
We're healthy. Syringes. Dreams.

1226
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,370
Couldn't do a rain breakup.

1227
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:13,999
It rained one day while we were dating,
but I was wearing a wool sweater.

1228
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,625
[retches]

1229
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,544
You know.

1230
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,714
You can't get wool wet.
You're going to smell like a dirty sheep.

1231
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:25,093
No one's going to miss you.
"You're breaking up with me?"

1232
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,388
[bleating] "I'm breaking up with you."

1233
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,598
So I had to plan an alternate breakup.

1234
01:03:30,682 --> 01:03:34,144
Now, before I share with you
my alternate fantasy breakup,

1235
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,604
I'm going to tell you
the way we actually broke up.

1236
01:03:36,688 --> 01:03:39,566
The way we actually broke up was
yours truly got a little drunk

1237
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:43,194
and a little honest one night
and texted him something to the effect of,

1238
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:47,365
"You don't even watch Breaking Bad.
How are we supposed to be together?"

1239
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:50,827
[laughter and applause]

1240
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,537
Fried shrimp.

1241
01:03:53,997 --> 01:03:58,168
So now, I'm going to share with you
my ultimate fantasy breakup.

1242
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,045
- 'Kay.
- [whooping and cheering]

1243
01:04:00,128 --> 01:04:01,338
Thank you.

1244
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:07,594
In my fantasy, we will be
sitting on my couch, at my house,

1245
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,888
and I will be a little bit
more tan than I am now,

1246
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,183
so people will be like,
"Where did you go on vacation?"

1247
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,101
I'll be like, "It's a secret. Huh."

1248
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:19,856
My hair would be a little bit longer,
but not too long... I'd have, like, layers.

1249
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,983
You know what I'm talking about?
A long bob?

1250
01:04:22,067 --> 01:04:24,194
Where you want to keep
the length but not the weight,

1251
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:26,071
so you'd have, like, layers.

1252
01:04:26,154 --> 01:04:28,782
And maybe highlights in the front,
but maybe a partial.

1253
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:31,326
Like, some warmer tones,
like a honey for the fall.

1254
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,204
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1255
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:38,166
Mm-kay. Sitting on my couch,
at my house,

1256
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:41,669
and I would start a fight
out of nowhere.

1257
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:46,633
When you're a woman,
you possess a magical, innate ability

1258
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,636
to create conflict
where there formerly was none.

1259
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,182
All right, we're talking
out of thin fucking air.

1260
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:58,603
We could do this as a show in Las Vegas.
Argument illusionists. Just creating them.

1261
01:04:58,686 --> 01:05:00,730
Nothing up my sleeve!
Nothing in my hand!

1262
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,816
Now there's a fight, motherfucker.

1263
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,193
[laughter]

1264
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,821
[cheers and applause]

1265
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,033
Maybe we'll have a dove. [coos]

1266
01:05:12,117 --> 01:05:15,453
I don't know the budget.
I don't know what we'll have.

1267
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:19,999
The point is, if the girl wants to have
a fight, the lady shall have a fight.

1268
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,794
And there's nothing you can do about it.

1269
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:25,839
You can cough.
That's enough kindle for that fire.

1270
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,966
Sitting there watching TV.
[coughs]

1271
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,722
"What did you say?"

1272
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,058
"I didn't say anything."

1273
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:42,147
- "What the fuck did you just say?"
- "I didn't say anything."

1274
01:05:42,230 --> 01:05:44,774
"You know what? Forget it!"
And I would start crying.

1275
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:49,696
Start crying. I'm telling you now
that I'm going to cry then.

1276
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:51,489
I'm planning to cry.

1277
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,367
I'm gonna put it in my phone.
Set reminder: "Cry later."

1278
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,496
Going to make myself cry.
How do you make yourself cry?

1279
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:01,875
That's what you're thinking.
Iliza, how do you make yourself cry?

1280
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:05,211
Lot of actresses get paid
a lot of money to make themselves cry.

1281
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,046
How do you make yourself cry?

1282
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:10,717
I'm going to tell you.
You take a small pocketknife...

1283
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,720
- I'm just kidding. Um...
- [laughter]

1284
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:16,639
Turn around, and unbeknownst
to him, I would pluck...

1285
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,308
a solitary nose hair.

1286
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:22,937
You ever do that?

1287
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,357
That shit hurts...

1288
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:30,111
real bad.

1289
01:06:30,195 --> 01:06:32,614
It's physically undetectable...
[blows]

1290
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:37,535
...and it's going to escalate the energy
of your argument very quickly.

1291
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,914
Your argument will magically
be transformed

1292
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,124
from, "You know what?
Just forget it!"

1293
01:06:43,208 --> 01:06:45,418
[wailing]

1294
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,629
Big tears, okay?

1295
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:50,548
I'll tell you why it's important
to have big tears, okay?

1296
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:54,552
If you're going to make the attempt
to elicit an emotional response

1297
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:57,847
from an otherwise emotionally
unavailable individual,

1298
01:06:57,931 --> 01:07:01,267
you must be demonstrative
with your ocular lubrication, okay?

1299
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,478
Unlike women,
men are very black and white.

1300
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,563
They respond to big gestures, okay?

1301
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:07,649
Big tears means I am sad.
This is not fun.

1302
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:11,319
I do not like this. I'm sad now.
That's what big tears say.

1303
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:15,156
You can't risk it with little, snivelly
allergy tears. That's a mixed message.

1304
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,450
- "What do you want?"
- "I don't know what I want!"

1305
01:07:17,534 --> 01:07:19,869
He might go kill you a squirrel
and bring it back.

1306
01:07:19,953 --> 01:07:22,080
He doesn't know what you want!

1307
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,874
[laughter and scattered applause]

1308
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:27,460
So I'd start crying.
"You know what? Forget it!"

1309
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:30,129
And I would run out of my own house.
I'd run outside.

1310
01:07:30,213 --> 01:07:31,714
Now...

1311
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:34,842
prior to starting this fight,
I would have gone into the street

1312
01:07:34,926 --> 01:07:38,054
and set up orange parking cones
in the street, okay?

1313
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,223
Because for my ultimate
fantasy breakup,

1314
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,892
I want to have a street fight breakup.

1315
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,563
Anyone that's ever
fought in the street knows,

1316
01:07:46,646 --> 01:07:49,274
you need a designated
fighting area, okay?

1317
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:52,485
That's a public thoroughfare. You can't
just run into it and start fighting.

1318
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,113
This isn't West Side Story.
You're gonna get hit by a Buick.

1319
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,825
So I'd run outside, into the comfort

1320
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:01,578
of the Designated Fighting Area,
the DFA.

1321
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:05,164
Run into it, and I'd immediately
start yelling, "I hate you!"

1322
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:08,376
Why am I yelling?
'Cause I'm angry? I'm not angry.

1323
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,171
Want the neighbors to come out.

1324
01:08:12,255 --> 01:08:15,341
Want the neighbors to come out.
I want them to see how you treat me!

1325
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,843
He treats me fine.

1326
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,513
We got frozen yogurt that morning.
It's fine.

1327
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:24,601
I want them to come out.
I want their energy.

1328
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:29,731
I want their attention. I need
an audience. Like, obviously. So...

1329
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:31,983
I'd have it set up, and he'd run out.

1330
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,485
"Iliza, what is your problem?
Get back inside."

1331
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,630
"You don't tell me what to do.
I'm an independent woman.

1332
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:40,033
I listen to Beyoncé. Surfbort.

1333
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,410
Surfbort."

1334
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,079
- "What does that mean?"
- "No one knows."

1335
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:49,542
"What are you so upset about?"
I'd be like, "I just feel like, um...

1336
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:52,629
this is so hard because
I feel like I'm, like, letting you down.

1337
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:55,048
I just feel like...

1338
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:58,343
we don't even talk anymore, and...

1339
01:08:58,426 --> 01:09:02,347
we don't even know what we argue about...

1340
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:06,768
[laughter]

1341
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:14,108
- "You quoting Boyz II Men?"
- "Maybe."

1342
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,755
"I don't know why you're so upset."
And then I would begin.

1343
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:21,699
"I just feel like, um...
I'm sorry, I just feel like...

1344
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,993
Why is this dry? [lips pop]

1345
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,787
[weeping] I just feel like...

1346
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,497
[laughter]

1347
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:31,417
You're a great guy,
and you should be with a great girl.

1348
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,920
I want you to be with a great girl,
sort of.

1349
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,755
And I want you to be...

1350
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:38,925
I feel we have a really good time
together, and you're wonderful,

1351
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:42,095
but I feel I'm not the girl for you.
Okay, I said it. And we have fun,

1352
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,979
but I don't feel like we're
gonna be together.

1353
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:46,641
We're just wasting time,
and we don't belong together.

1354
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,143
I feel like we don't
really even know each other."

1355
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,979
"Of course we know each other!
Of course I know you!"

1356
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:53,481
"Really?

1357
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,275
[demonic voice]
What's my middle name?"

1358
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:03,991
[cheers and applause]

1359
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:11,124
[techno music thumping]

1360
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,084
Snow!

1361
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:20,925
My bra.

1362
01:10:21,008 --> 01:10:22,885
- We did it.
- [man] Good job.

1363
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:24,595
Snow.

1364
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:40,153
Should I do a curtain call?
Is that weird?

1365
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,488
[man 2] They're kind of
going crazy out there.

1366
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:44,907
- [man] You wanna do a curtain call?
- Is it too late?

1367
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:48,536
[cheers and applause continuing]

1368
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:56,335
[cheering, whistling]

1369
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,308
[indistinct remark]

1370
01:11:10,391 --> 01:11:11,809
Blanche, you did it!

1371
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,437
- [man chuckles]
- She did it.

1372
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,652
Oh my God.

1373
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,821
I think, um...

1374
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,824
that the theater
might file a police report

1375
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:29,619
and I might have to get a lawyer...

1376
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:31,329
because I killed!

1377
01:11:31,412 --> 01:11:33,414
Ohh!
[laughs]
