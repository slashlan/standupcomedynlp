1
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,470
<i>Holy shit.</i>

2
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,600
<i>What the fuck is up, Atlanta?</i>

3
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,730
<i>This shit is fuckin' amazing, man.</i>

4
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,650
<i>Wow.</i>

5
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,280
<i>This shit really hit me today.</i>

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,030
<i>I was-- I was walking to the venue and,</i>

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>you know, all the emotions.</i>

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,490
<i>Like, this is my fucking special.</i>

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,870
<i>I'm here, I'm doing the shit</i>
<i>that I set out to do</i>

10
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,580
<i>this whole fuckin' time.</i>

11
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,000
<i>You know?</i>

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,090
I was walking down,
and I was-- I was coming...

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,010
through the alleyway, and I was like,
"This is really some full-circle shit."

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,380
'Cause the last dude I fucked...

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,010
I met at a bar right over there.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,270
The last dick I took,
I met right over there.

17
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,560
Yeah!

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:07,850
Crazy!
That was the last dick I sucked. Whoa!

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,190
Every time I think about it,
my mind's blown.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,150
Like, "Bitch, you was sucking dicks."

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,030
I don't like dicks at all!

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,790
Like, I know that for a fact.
I don't like dicks.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't even like wearing 'em
when bitches ask me to.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,420
I don't like dicks.

25
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,840
And I was suckin' whole dicks,
just putting 'em in my mouth.

26
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,010
The shit we'll do to fit in, you know?

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,350
I just wanted to be friends
with my friends!

28
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,480
I just wanted to be able to talk
to my peer group.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,770
Like, "Yeah, girl,
the balls are salty like that.

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,520
The balls be salty as fuck. I know, girl.

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,740
It's crazy how salty the balls are."

32
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:57,990
Suckin' whole dicks... Nutty!

33
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,200
Never was good at it, either.
D-minus dick-sucker.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
D-minus.

35
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,910
Never won the dick-suck game.

36
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,040
I had some nights--
I had some Jordan flu game.

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:13,380
"Tonight's the night I ball!"
You know, just go-hard nights.

38
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,470
I have to say that disclaimer 'cause
I'll be like, "I'm a bad dick-sucker,"

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,340
and somebody in the crowd'll be like,
"She sucked the shit out my dick!"

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,350
I'll be like, "Oh, God dammit!

41
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,810
I did. That night, I did. I did...

42
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,270
do the fuckin' job."

43
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,270
Shit is wild, man.

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,690
I'm with my girl. I travel everywhere
with my girl, which is stupid.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,990
I bring my girl everywhere
'cause I love her, but also, uh, fuck her.

46
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,370
You know, it's annoying.

47
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,120
Like, I'm in love, I'm in love.
This is a woman I've chased.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,450
I'm in love.
I've chased this woman for years.

49
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,040
But also, like,
"Oh, shut the fuck up and go away."

50
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,540
Like, we shouldn't
be taking trips together.

51
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,000
I realized that
that's where I'm fucking up.

52
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,380
We should be going on trips,
but on separate trips.

53
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,880
Like, she goes to Hawaii,
I go to London, then we switch.

54
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,970
You know what I mean?
I go to Hawaii, she goes to London.

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,480
So we see the same shit
so we can talk about it later.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,190
We'll have a dialogue,

57
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,980
but we don't actually have to be
in the same fuckin' space.

58
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,690
'Cause that seems to be
creating the problems.

59
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,200
Recently, I went home, back to Boston.
That's where I'm from.

60
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,780
I'm a Boston kid, you know?

61
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,000
But I also don't go back often
because my whole family's there.

62
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,000
Like, all of them.

63
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,170
I love 'em, but it's a lot. Know
what I mean? So I try to avoid it.

64
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,800
But I was like, "My girl needs to meet
my people. I'm goin' home."

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,510
I take my girl, I go back home.

66
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,840
It was nice at first.
She met my favorite uncle.

67
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,640
He's my favorite 'cause every time
I see him, he asks if I'm still gay.

68
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,890
Which is nice.

69
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,980
Every time I see him, he's like,
"Hey, you still messin' with the ladies?"

70
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,690
Like, one day, I was like,
"Nah, Unc, back suckin' these dicks!

71
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,940
Back on these dicks, partner.
That's what...

72
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,110
Puttin' my mouth on balls again, baby.
That's... how I like to live."

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,910
But it was dope.
It was nice for my girl to just see...

74
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,830
where the fuck I come from, you know?

75
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,410
You always want that with your partner.

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,960
Just see how I grew up.
See the people that raised me.

77
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,920
Just get to know me a little bit better.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,170
And all of that felt really good.
We was havin' a great time.

79
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,590
I took her out, she met
my friends from high school.

80
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,930
Lot of my homegirls,
they were telling her stories about

81
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,550
how I used to have
my titties out and shit, you know?

82
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,180
Just lettin' her know who I used to be.
Everything was chill.

83
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,220
Everything was comfortable. It felt great.

84
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,390
But it got awkward 'cause I bumped into
the dude I lost my virginity to.

85
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,560
- Oh, shit!
- It was weird, as we look the same now.

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,690
Like, same outfit, same haircut.
"What's up, nigga? What the fuck you...

87
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,490
What's good with you, cuz?

88
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,160
Fuck you want?"

89
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,210
I saw him before he saw me.
I was like, "Shit, I sucked his dick."

90
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,380
You know, like, I was...
"Oh, my God!" Because, for a dyke,

91
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,210
when you see old dicks you sucked,
they're like hauntings, you know?

92
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,170
It's just like,
"Remember you used to do this?"

93
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,300
Like, "Oh, my God."

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,760
"Please don't come this fuckin' way."

95
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,430
I was like, "God, I sucked his dick.
What's he gonna do?"

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,850
He seen me. At first, he was cool.

97
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,770
He gave me the "you know you sucked
my dick" head nod, kept it moving.

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,690
He was just like, "You know what you did."
"I know, I know, I know."

99
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,030
Weird, though, weird to be around my girl,
trying to be the best man I'm gonna be

100
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,860
and then seeing a dick I sucked.

101
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,740
I was like, "I don't like this at all."

102
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,830
Then he said the dumbest thing to me.

103
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,700
We're standing across from each other,
he went, "I just need to say this.

104
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:38,170
I just hope I'm not the reason...
you're like this."

105
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,710
Like, nigga, what?

106
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,590
You think your 15-year-old dick
swayed me in any direction?

107
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,930
We were fucking kids, man.

108
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,260
We could've been humpin' mattresses,
you know?

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,390
Hell, no! Just sometimes, people be gay
and don't know it. It's possible.

110
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,770
I was a whole gay bitch, didn't know.
People knew before me.

111
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,310
I came out, some of my old friends was
like, "Duh, bitch!" I was like, "Really?

112
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,150
Really? You knew this whole time?

113
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,410
'Cause this whole time, I was
for sure thinkin' I liked dick." I did.

114
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,280
I did! I knew I wasn't enjoying sex.

115
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,580
My homegirls would talk about sex. I was
like, "I don't like it like they like it,"

116
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,160
but I didn't think I didn't like dick.

117
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,580
I just thought,
"I ain't found the right dick yet."

118
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,710
They'd be like, "When you
feel it in your stomach..."

119
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,290
I was like, "Ooh, that's my least
favorite part, when you...

120
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,300
When it hit the stomach,
you know it's really there. You can't--

121
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,880
I don't like that at all."

122
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,390
But I didn't think I didn't like dick.
I just thought, you know,

123
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,600
"Keep suckin' these dicks.
Concentrate. Work harder.

124
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,310
Focus on the dicks you're suckin'.
Visualize.

125
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,440
You'll fucking get there."

126
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,490
That's why representation matters, man.

127
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,910
It does. It matters. You need
to see yourself in the fuckin' world.

128
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,160
Like, I didn't realize you could be black
and gay and, like, fly and shit.

129
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,410
Like, I'm from Boston, bro.
We didn't have black dykes.

130
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,750
We didn't have black dykes.
We had white dykes.

131
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,170
They drove Subarus and had
long armpit hair. And I was like, "No."

132
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,880
I was like, "No, that's not what I am.
I'm not that.

133
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,760
I don't do that. I'm not with that."

134
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,010
We had one black dyke,
and that bitch was on crack.

135
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,640
And I was like,
"If that's what dyking leads to,

136
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,440
that's not a life for me.

137
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,400
I need to focus on these dicks.
Concentrate."

138
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,070
"Concentrate and work hard
and make somethin' of myself."

139
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:38,080
You honestly couldn't be black and gay
outside of Atlanta until 2012.

140
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,870
It just didn't exist
anywhere else in the world.

141
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,960
So I didn't know, you know?

142
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,920
I was like, "Nah, man, I'm just...
into licking these dicks and balls."

143
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,260
Not at all. And then I ate a pussy,
and I was like, "Bitch!"

144
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,220
The world opened the fuck up.

145
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,600
I was like, "Oh, this is what everyone
said when they said they like it."

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,350
I never understood the liking it part.
I was like, "Sex is just a job.

147
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,110
You don't like it, you just do it."
And then, fuck it.

148
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,110
But, no, you can like it.

149
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,400
Like, now I eat pussy,
I'm like, "This is it, I'm a winner.

150
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,200
Now I'm winning. I feel in control.
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

151
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,240
This is where I was
supposed to be. In the pussy."

152
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,670
Now I'm in love, so I'm only in one pussy,
and that's weird.

153
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,880
It's weird 'cause I know it's
the only pussy I'm gonna be in forever.

154
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,840
It's not always great, right?

155
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,390
When you fuck the same person forever,
you know, there's downsides to that.

156
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,810
There's highs and lows.
Cause now, we've been fucking since,

157
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,480
I don't know, we was 22?

158
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm 30-something, so it's like,
"I don't care about this pussy anymore."

159
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,360
Like, I love her, but the pussy,
I don't give a fuck.

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,030
It could come, it could go,
it could not be there.

161
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,490
But I'm tryin' to do it.
I am. I'm like, I'm in love.

162
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,320
That's why I bring her everywhere.
That's why we travel and shit.

163
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,030
We just went to Europe recently.

164
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,120
Three weeks in Europe.
Big fuckin' mistake.

165
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,750
Three weeks. Mm-mm-mm.
Too long. Shouldn't have done it.

166
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,170
It was fucked up
before we even left New York.

167
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,840
Before we got out our apartment,
it was problematic.

168
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,090
It started with the packing.

169
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,680
Everything broke down
with the fuckin' packing.

170
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,970
Everything was goin' good.
We was packing, she was packing,

171
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,140
I was packin',
everything felt respectable.

172
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,520
But then she started packin' a third bag.

173
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,150
And that really confused me,
'cause she only has two arms.

174
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,730
So I was like, "How you packin' three bags
with two arms, baby girl?

175
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,950
You don't got enough arms
for the bags you packin'.

176
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,070
What a presumptuous,
bold fuckin' move,

177
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,200
to pack bags
you don't got fuckin' arms for!

178
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,250
Who's supposed to be in charge
of these fuckin' bags?

179
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,710
Who's gonna be the boss, bitch?
I don't understand."

180
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,670
Then we got to an airport
and it caused a fight

181
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,050
because she forgets I'm not a man,
I'm not a fucking man.

182
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,880
I'm not.
So I don't have any chivalry.

183
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,840
I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!

184
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,300
I don't give a fuck.

185
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,720
I am a whole bitch.
I have no chivalry in me.

186
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,890
Are you crazy? So it's not like I saw her
struggling with the bags and was like,

187
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,810
"I can't let my baby struggle!"

188
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,770
"I gotta get these bags!"

189
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,360
Fuck, no! I was just like,
"Stupid bitch! Bring less bags.

190
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,360
Dumb motherfucker.
That was dumb as all hell."

191
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,450
"Bringin' bags
you ain't got enough arms for.

192
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,030
Who the fuck does that?

193
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,210
You see, I got bags for arms, baby girl.
That's how I goddamn roll.

194
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,380
Hell's wrong with you?"

195
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,090
So she's strugglin', lookin' stupid,

196
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,130
and I'm just watching like,
"Mm-mm-mm," you know?

197
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,970
"Mm."

198
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,090
Then this dude comes
and tries to save the day,

199
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,970
'cause that's what dudes like to do,
you know?

200
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,270
Especially when men see a masculine woman.
That's their favorite shit.

201
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,180
They like to come, like,
"I got the real dick." You know?

202
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,650
Filthy fucks. "I got the real--
Where you want--

203
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:53,230
Where you need my dick to go?

204
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,570
What bag my dick gotta pick up?

205
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,150
What you want my dick--
You need my dick over here?"

206
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,820
"Shut up."

207
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,410
This fucking clown come--
"I got the real-- I got the real dick."

208
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,040
And he jacks up the bag,

209
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,500
and he looks at me, 
and he's like, "Now what?"

210
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,960
Like, "Nigga, get mine too!

211
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,250
You gettin' bags,
get all the bitches' bags!

212
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,220
The fuck you think?
I'm a lady. Carry my shit."

213
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,680
"Be a fuckin' gentleman."

214
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,100
It doesn't help that I'm a nervous flier.
I'll say that. I didn't help.

215
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm a very nerve-racked flier.
I hate fuckin' flying.

216
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
I'm thinkin' about dying the whole time.

217
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,200
The entire trip, I'm just like,
"I'm fuckin' dead up here," you know?

218
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,200
I think if you're not thinkin'
about dying, you're a psychopath.

219
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,490
I don't know anyone who's just up there,
like, "This is how God intended it."

220
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,540
You know, what the fuck?
Clearly, we have no business up there.

221
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,040
We're watchin' ESPN, we're drinkin'.
Who the fuck do we think we are?

222
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,500
So ballsy. Chill out. You know?

223
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,460
This is delicate.

224
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,090
Then we like to give the illusion
of safety. "In case of an emergency."

225
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,890
Bitch, we're dead if there's an emerg--

226
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,140
This motherfucker's in the exit row
with his shoes off, drunk.

227
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,730
He's saving all of us? He's the guy?
He's the point man?

228
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,020
Fuck you! Fuck you!

229
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,730
You don't give a shit about us.
I watched you give this man drinks!

230
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,410
Maybe don't serve drinks
to the exit row niggas. Of all the niggas!

231
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,160
Maybe they have to be sober.

232
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:31,620
You want me to feel safe in the skies...
Kiss my ass!

233
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,960
I think about death in a weird--
I don't think like how most--

234
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,500
I think most people think
some regular-ass shit.

235
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,340
Right? They think, like, I don't know,

236
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,470
"What if the pilot takes us
into a mountain today

237
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,180
'cause he hates his fuckin' life?"

238
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,390
Or, "What if the engine fails?"
That's normal thoughts.

239
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,810
I think crazy, crazy shit.

240
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,600
I think, like, what if the company
that makes the chemical

241
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:54,730
that makes the doo-doo block...

242
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,730
Okay, so when you're on a plane
and you shit or you piss,

243
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,650
it don't just go to the birds, baby.

244
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,280
Right? You don't just flush it,
it's in the sky.

245
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,110
No, it stays on the fuckin' plane.

246
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,450
Like a camper.
And there's a chemical in there,

247
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,740
and it makes a gelatinous mess,
and when you land,

248
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,080
they suck that shit out,

249
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,540
they put a new chemical in
for your next flight.

250
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,380
I be thinking, what if the doo-doo block
company, right, the chemical company...

251
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,420
What if they skimp on a chemical?

252
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,840
Just on some American greed shit.
American companies are trash.

253
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,680
They're always doin' this type
of fuckin' shit, cuttin' corners.

254
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,220
We know this,
cuttin' corners, doin' funny shit.

255
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,470
What if one of these fuckin' companies,
like, "Know what?

256
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,350
We're not buyin' boric acid this month.
We don't fuckin' need boric acid.

257
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,730
It's $30,000 a unit and
it really doesn't do anything."

258
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,940
Then I'm in the sky, I take a shit,
the plane's half a pound heavier,

259
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,520
boom, into a mountain.

260
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,940
Fuckin' dead.

261
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,490
That's what the hell goes on in my brain.

262
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,620
Shit that can't be cured
with no safety video. You know?

263
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
Fuck are you--

264
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,450
So I'm nervous. I'm on edge.

265
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,790
As soon as I get on the plane,
I'm on edge, I'm on it.

266
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,870
I'm makin' sure everyone's phone's
on airplane mode.

267
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,380
'Cause that's everybody's job.

268
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,090
I'm just, like, "Look at him.
Why this nigga on <i>Candy Crush </i>like that?

269
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,970
Who's gonna do somethin' about that?
That's weird. I don't like any of this."

270
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:14,060
Then I sit down, and I notice my girl
still fuckin' around on her phone.

271
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,690
She ain't fuckin' changed her shit yet.
She playin' games and shit.

272
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:20,400
So I'm like,
"Hey, baby, when you gonna do it?

273
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,770
The guy said do it.

274
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:26,030
I think you should go ahead and do it."

275
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,990
And she snaps at me
'cause she's still mad over the bag shit.

276
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,700
So she's like, "You ain't gotta do it
till the plane takes off!"

277
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,910
And it's like,
"Bitch, you don't build planes!

278
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,500
You don't. You're not a plane scientist
or no shit like that.

279
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,550
You do it when the nigga drivin' the plane
says it's time to do it!

280
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,890
That's the opportune time."

281
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,140
And that caused another fight,
'cause I hit the button on that bitch.

282
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,440
I was like, "Bing,
get her the fuck outta here.

283
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,690
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

284
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:05,570
I'm not goin' in the sky with this bitch,
she actin' up on the ground.

285
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,860
How the fuck we gonna go in the sky?

286
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,200
You not followin' the ground rules,
baby girl!

287
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,490
That don't add up."

288
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,630
So then, I'm in my seat and shit,
right, and now we fightin'.

289
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,420
We tryin' to whisper-fight
like white people.

290
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,800
You know,
tryin' to get a good whisper-fight in.

291
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,220
We... pss-pss-pss-pss. Pffft!
You know? That goofy, goofy stuff.

292
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,270
And her main thing is, like,
she likes to fuck with me.

293
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:44,650
Like, she likes to, like, say shit to me
like she's reminding me I'm a woman.

294
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,570
Like I don't...
I fuckin' know that, you know?

295
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,070
But she likes to--
'Cause of my outfits and shit.

296
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,950
Know what I mean? 'Cause of how I dress.

297
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,320
She's like...

298
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,780
"I'ma break you down,
remind you you a whole bitch."

299
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,080
I was like, "Bitch, I got a pad in these
boxer briefs. I know what's happenin'.

300
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,750
I don't need this energy from you.

301
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,500
Goofy ass."

302
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,210
So we're sittin' in the seat,
and we're arguin',

303
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,840
and then she's like, "What the fuck
are you so afraid of, you scaredy bitch?

304
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,550
Are you on your period?"

305
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,300
And I was like, "Waaaah!"

306
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,810
Huh! I got so fuckin' mad!

307
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,850
Balled up my fist real tight like I was
about to punch the seat in front of me.

308
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,610
Like I was just gonna act, you know?

309
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,860
But the last time I did that,
we were at the house.

310
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,900
I balled my fist up and punched the wall,
and then I just hurt my hand real bad.

311
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,820
Nothin' happened. So I was like,
"Let me chill." So I was just like, "Aaah!

312
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,870
What to do? Aaaah!"

313
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:39,790
And then I just told the truth.

314
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,500
I was like, "I'm afraid to die!"

315
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,500
I yelled that on a plane.

316
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,880
Just put it out there, you know?
Just fuckin' be honest.

317
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,140
But as soon as I said it,
I realized it's not true.

318
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,060
I think I needed to hear it out loud.
I was like, "That's not it.

319
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,560
I'm not afraid to die.

320
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,270
Actually, death is inevitable, I know
it's gonna happen. I'm not afraid to die."

321
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,900
I realized in that moment
what I'm afraid of is surviving.

322
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,820
I don't wanna survive a plane crash.

323
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,240
I think about bein' that one asshole
floatin' on a piece of wing...

324
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,370
in the middle of the ocean
way more than I think about death.

325
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,370
Just...

326
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,420
On some <i>Life Of Pi</i> shit.
"Just live, nigga." No! That's trash.

327
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,880
No!

328
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,210
I don't wanna survive shit.

329
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,260
You don't come out of nothing
you survive clean. It don't matter.

330
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,470
If someone says, "I'm a survivor,"
they're fucked up a bit. They ain't clean.

331
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,590
It's fucked up.

332
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,390
I survive a plane crash,
now my arm's lopsided like this forever.

333
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,980
Forever, I just gotta be like this
when I talk to people. That's trash.

334
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
My fingertips don't work right no more, 
so I can't grip shit.

335
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,030
I can't pick nothin' up, forever.
I can't grip with it, I can't grab shit.

336
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,360
I lose my legs,
and now I gotta be the no-legs comic.

337
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,780
I gotta roll up here with no legs.

338
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,740
"I used to have legs,
but they gone.

339
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,620
Y'all heard about the crash.

340
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,790
Don't worry about me." Bullshit!

341
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,000
Fuck that.

342
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,040
No!

343
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:14,050
Or I float on a deserted island, and then
it's just like, "Fight for your life!"

344
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,840
Like, everything's intact,
and it's just like, "Get it in!"

345
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,640
'Cause that's the problem with survival.
Survival begs the question,

346
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,600
"Do you have the will to live?"

347
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,220
And the answer is no. I already know that.

348
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:28,560
I don't give a fuck about life enough
to fight for it, for real.

349
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,270
Like, every time I watch <i>Cast Away,</i>
I'm like, "Nigga, just be dead!

350
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,980
What the fuck are you doin'?

351
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,700
Lay on the beach
and let the waves take you, dawg.

352
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,360
This is ridiculous!"

353
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,660
<i>Walking Dead?</i>
Once my phone's dead, bro, I'm dead.

354
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,660
Where am I goin' without a GPS?

355
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,170
I don't know how to use a compass.
I'm not white.

356
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,590
White people still... I don't know.

357
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:59,800
Like, y'all preparin' for some shit
but y'all won't tell us what it is.

358
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,430
Y'all move so weird, man.

359
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,720
Y'all actions are weird!

360
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,140
Y'all gettin' ready.
And the world's endin'.

361
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,600
Everything's burnin', we get it,
and y'all preparin'.

362
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,810
Just tell us. Tell us what's happenin'!

363
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,770
Stop keepin' this shit to yourself.

364
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,490
They do weird shit.
They just get lost in the woods for no--

365
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,530
"Let's just follow the North Star out."

366
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,200
Bitch, why?

367
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,160
Doing Tough Mudders and shit,
just runnin' through the mud.

368
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,460
Just runnin'-- Why?

369
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
But when you think about it,
when mudslides hit,

370
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,420
them niggas gonna be movin',
doof, doof, doof!

371
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
Niggas, on the other hand, we're fucked.

372
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,510
We prepare for nothin'.

373
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:45,350
We have no plan for the end of the world,
and it's clear it's happenin'.

374
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:47,470
All we're gonna do is meet in Atlanta.

375
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,940
That's niggas' plan. Just meet in Atlanta.

376
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,770
Just gonna be a bunch of niggas
in front of a Waffle House, like,

377
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,320
"Well, I assumed--
I assumed this was the spot,

378
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,320
and then...
and then we'd talk about what's next."

379
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,950
"Thought we'd get together first.

380
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,750
What I wanna know is, who's cookin'?

381
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,910
Who's doin' the cookin' this whole time?"

382
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,750
Jesus!

383
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,340
They're gettin' ready, for real.
Watch these motherfuckers.

384
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,630
They move funny!

385
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,430
All their actions are in preparedness,
but we don't know for what, right?

386
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,220
Like, I was watching <i>Naked And Afraid</i>
for the first time last week.

387
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:32,350
Why the fuck are you doin' that shit,
white people?

388
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,400
You just wanna know you can live
naked and scared? Nigga, both?

389
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Why both?

390
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,280
Both together, not even separate?
That's crazy!

391
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:47,200
Bunch of white dudes died
climbin' the Himalayas.

392
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,160
What the fuck you goin' up there for?

393
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,660
Everything you need down here!

394
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,620
You just wanna know
you can sleep with less air?

395
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,090
Where the air goin'?
Nigga, the air runnin' out?

396
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,420
We losin' air? Tell us!

397
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,350
Why y'all keepin' this shit to yourselves?

398
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,720
Put everybody on, goddamn.

399
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,020
I saw a bunch of white people checkin'
their restin' heart rate the other day.

400
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,520
"Bitch, we about to have to run?
Where we going?

401
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,190
Bitch, where we going?
Why are you just checkin' that shit?

402
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,620
What do y'all know that I don't know?
I don't like that."

403
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,200
This nigga Elon Musk
be goin' to space by hisself.

404
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,960
What the fuck is that white man
doin' in space alone?

405
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,710
That's not suspicious to anybody but me?

406
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,630
That this motherfucker goes to space
without the government, without NASA?

407
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,970
Which I didn't even know
you could fuckin' do!

408
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,970
As far as I knew,
they were the space niggas.

409
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,510
They run space!

410
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,930
You wanna fuck with space,
you gotta fuck with them.

411
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,690
This motherfucker built a spaceship
like it's a go-kart, goes on Tuesdays.

412
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,860
Bitch, space day is Saturday!

413
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,110
Everybody know that!

414
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,150
You can't leave midweek
to go to goddamn space!

415
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,570
It's an event.
It happens Saturday, the TV's on.

416
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,990
This nigga be goin' Wednesday night. What?

417
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:16,210
From Sacramento, at that.
Bitch, space place is Cape Canaveral.

418
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:17,750
That's where you go from.

419
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,300
Ain't no entry point to Mars
from fuckin' Sacramento.

420
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,390
And when you're goin' to space,
you at least tell the people. It's a PSA.

421
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,600
Get on the goddamn news, say,

422
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,230
"Hey, people, I'm about to fuck around
in space. Don't be alarmed."

423
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,100
This nigga just went.
We thought it was aliens.

424
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,610
"Is it aliens?"
"No, just Elon doin' donuts in the sky."

425
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:42,940
What the fuck is this?

426
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,440
Whoo!

427
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,410
White man ambition is some shit.

428
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:57,000
You wanna know where the racism is?
That's where the fuck it is, white men.

429
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,790
I know y'all still confused.
Look at him. "What are you talkin' about?"

430
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,380
Fuckin' confused.

431
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,800
'Cause they don't get--
Everyone learns the history.

432
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,050
So you're like, "No one's gettin' hung,
and we ain't beatin' nobody.

433
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,470
I work next to a black guy,
and he has a car, so... equality."

434
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,180
Just lay the fuck down,
rest easy, 'cause everything's fair.

435
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,940
Fuckin' nut job!

436
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,650
Everything's not fair!

437
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,230
'Cause while you're sleepin',
you're dreamin' about buyin' Mars, nigga!

438
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,780
I've never thought I could do
no shit like that a day in my life.

439
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,660
I thought about havin' all the money.
I thought, "If I get all the money,

440
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,460
I'm gonna buy them gold ceilings
Master P had in <i>Cribs."</i>

441
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,130
"That's what the fuck I'ma do
when I get all the goddamn money."

442
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,170
Space by my goddamn self, bitch? Never!

443
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,880
Even if I thought about goin' to space,
I'd call NASA first.

444
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,720
"Yo, NASA, this Sam. Can I go?

445
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,600
You know what?
It is Tuesday. Space day is Saturday."

446
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,610
So we land in London...

447
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,740
We land in London,

448
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,580
and we decided not to fight anymore,

449
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,040
'cause I think that's how
couples traveling work, right?

450
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,750
You get to the place
you're supposed to be,

451
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,540
you're like,
"We can fight where we pay rent.

452
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,500
Let's just try to fuckin' be friends.

453
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,630
We've never seen any of this shit before.
Let's just try to be cool," right?

454
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,010
So we get to London.
"We're in London, what are we gonna do?

455
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,970
Which is new shit for me,
'cause I'm a grown-up,

456
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,760
and now I go out in the daytime.

457
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,100
I used to be able to travel like this.
"Let's sleep all day

458
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,350
and get fucked up all night.

459
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,560
I wanna see this city high and drunk,"
you know?

460
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,020
But now I'm an old bitch, I'm like,
"I wanna see architecture.

461
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,230
I wanna know how...

462
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,820
how they built the buildings."

463
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,610
We get to London, I'm like, "We still got
some time, let's go to a fuckin' museum."

464
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,240
My girl's like, "Hell, yeah. Let's go."

465
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,410
'Cause we old bitches,
and old bitches like the museum.

466
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,540
But we're not that old, so we took
mushrooms first, 'cause, yeah...

467
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,460
Fuckin' turn the museum up.

468
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,670
So we take these shrooms...

469
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,970
and we're like,
"Let's get out, let's do it."

470
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,300
We go to the British Museum.

471
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,930
That's the biggest fuckin' museum
in London, in the city.

472
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,390
We go to the British Museum.
It's huge. I was overwhelmed.

473
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,230
I was high as shit.
I walked in, I was like, "Holy shit."

474
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:30,020
'Cause it was wing after wing
after wing of stuff, and it blew my mind

475
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:34,030
'cause I was like,
"Wow, white people stole all this shit!"

476
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,740
"Stole so much shit!"

477
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,200
"All this shit is stolen. That's crazy!"

478
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,710
It was like, "Wow!

479
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,420
They stole everything
in this motherfucker!"

480
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,920
The audacity! I think that's the real word
to describe white people.

481
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,760
It's not racist. Audacious!

482
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,180
The fuckin' audacity!

483
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,100
'Cause everyone steals. I'm not saying
you're the only one that steals.

484
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,770
Everybody steals.
Niggas steal, black people steal,

485
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,980
but when we steal, we spread the shit out.

486
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,360
'Cause we're afraid. We're like,
"They might come at any moment.

487
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,150
Try to get back some of this shit. So put
some at Joe's, put some over here..."

488
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,740
Not the white man.
"Put it all in one building."

489
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,950
"Erect a fortress for it.

490
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,040
And, yes, charge them $20 to see it.

491
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,040
Their own shit."

492
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,550
"And if one of 'em touches it,
shoot 'em."

493
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,840
Jesus!

494
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,730
But they got all the culture.

495
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,810
Another thing that fucked me up
when I was London.

496
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,900
I was like, "These motherfuckers
got all the culture.

497
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,730
We don't have shit. We're trash."

498
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,030
We have no culture in America.
We think we do.

499
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,610
"We'll go see the Liberty Bell."
That's garbage. It's trash.

500
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,910
It's trash.
It's all just young, ignorant--

501
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,660
We don't have good--
They have Rembrandts, they got Shake--

502
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,910
They got the fucking culture, you know?

503
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,210
And as Americans,
we just fiend out for their culture.

504
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,670
We just be goin' over there,
"Let me get some of your culture.

505
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,920
Let me borrow a Rembrandt
for two million for one month,

506
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,590
'cause my kids need some art," you know?

507
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,840
They got all the shit.

508
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,640
I was with my girl, we went into
this one room, we went to the Egypt side.

509
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,600
We went into this one room,
there was six mummies in one room.

510
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,310
Fuckin' blew my mind.

511
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,940
I was like, "Babe, look, six mummies
in here." She got all attitudey.

512
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,560
She was like, "Why you actin' like that?

513
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,560
Why you actin' like
you never been nowhere?"

514
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,530
She thought I was being one
of those people that go to another country

515
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,860
and act like
it's so much better than America.

516
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,320
Which is annoying, you know?

517
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,280
Go somewhere, people are like,
"Flowers in America don't look like this."

518
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,540
Like, shut the fuck up. That's irritating.

519
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,540
She thought I was doing that.

520
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:50,960
She was like, "What's the big deal?
You seen a mummy before."

521
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,170
And I was like, "Yeah, bitch, one! I ain't
never seen six together in one room!"

522
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,960
That's how they do us in America,
'cause we borrowin' the culture.

523
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,590
In America, we get one mummy.

524
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,340
Every three summers!

525
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,640
And we work that nigga
like Joe Jackson worked the Jackson 5.

526
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,390
"Listen up, Mummy!
Tomorrow, Memphis. Schenectady!

527
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,270
Take your ass down to Ohio."

528
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,490
We left the museum.
We was like, "Let's get a cab."

529
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,160
I was like, "Fuck it, let's Uber. Let's
see what the London Uber shit is like."

530
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,740
Like it was gonna be less rapey
or somethin'.

531
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Like, "Maybe it's not as rapey,
or maybe it's rapey

532
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,920
with, like, a tip of the hat
or somethin'."

533
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,670
Just somethin' different, you know?

534
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,050
So we get an Uber,
and I-- I will say this--

535
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,300
I didn't like, also, being overseas...
'Cause...

536
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,850
I just feel like people are ballsy now
'cause of who the president is,

537
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,310
how, like, our country is, like,

538
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:51,770
so people feel like
they can just talk shit to you, you know?

539
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,310
You go to a foreign country,
people are like, "Huh," you know?

540
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,730
Think they can take fucking shots

541
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,690
'cause they think
our country's in despair.

542
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,570
So I get in the Uber,
and as soon as he hears my accent,

543
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,440
the motherfucker goes off.

544
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,740
He's like, "Ugh, America, ugh, eurgh...

545
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,330
Eurgh! Trump! Bleurgh!
When are you guys gonna do--"

546
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:13,040
Like, nigga, Theresa May, Hitler.
Suck my dick.

547
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,750
Yeah!

548
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,420
Like you don't have your fuckin' problems.
Lick my balls. Get out of here.

549
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,430
I don't get defensive. I think a lot
of people get fuckin' defensive, you know?

550
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,640
Especially liberals.
Liberals like to defend America.

551
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,270
"Don't judge us by the president.

552
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:35,980
We are such a better country
than the president."

553
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,060
No the fuck we're not!

554
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,320
If we were,
he wouldn't be the fucking president.

555
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,360
That's not how shit works.

556
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,490
We're better than Trump?
We're a country of Golden Corral buffets.

557
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,290
Who the fuck do be think we are?

558
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,710
Trash! We're trash.

559
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,260
Troughs of macaroni, 9.99 prime rib.
That's our shit. Garbage shit.

560
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,390
Dollar burgers from fast-food restaurants,

561
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,720
then we complain
when them shits gives us cancer.

562
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,970
"Hey! This 99-cent meat almost killed me!"

563
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:19,020
Duh, bitch! How the fuck
you think you get 99-cent meat?

564
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:22,230
You stretch it out
with a little bit of cancer!

565
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,230
There's only one way to make this shit!

566
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,030
How else do you think we achieve
this fuckin' goal? You...

567
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
dummy.

568
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,460
Plus, I don't know...

569
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:40,130
Trump's our first nigga president.
That's gotta matter.

570
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,710
In the history and shit.
I'm talking about history-wise.

571
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,300
I'm not talkin' about right now.

572
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,470
I'm talking about when we look back at
the world. "Oh, we in the history books."

573
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,760
Pfft, pfft. We're gonna see Barack.
We'll be like, "Oh, good black man."

574
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,350
There's Trump, a whole nigga.

575
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,230
First time we ever had a nigga
in the White House,

576
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,560
and the first nigga is white.

577
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,980
That gotta mean somethin'.

578
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,400
He ain't ever been a president.
That's why Democrats can't beat him.

579
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,320
They know how to deal with presidents.
Not how to deal with niggas.

580
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,120
This is all back-of-the-bus energy.

581
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,870
They don't know
what the fuck to do with that.

582
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,550
Every decision is a nigga decision.
He ain't never been presidential.

583
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:28,630
He just let 11 of his friends outta jail
for no reason.

584
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,970
Everything y'all thought
the black one was gonna do.

585
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,430
If you white and voted for him,
everything you thought the black--

586
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,980
He was just like, "Let 'em out."
"Why?" "'Cause I like 'em.

587
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,480
They my friends. Let 'em out."

588
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,980
He killed an Iranian general.

589
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,070
He killed a general of another country

590
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:50,490
that we have consistently
had problems with.

591
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,990
Killed this man, and first of all,

592
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,450
I didn't even know
we was mad at them at the moment.

593
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,740
Had no idea. That's how you know
that was some personal nigga shit.

594
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:00,710
That was beef. He was like, "If you see
the nigga slidin', hit my jack.

595
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,830
I don't like that motherfucker."

596
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,090
"You catch him dipping,
hit my jack, hit my jack.

597
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,800
I got somethin' for his ass."

598
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,680
Confused Iran so much, they put 80 mil
on his head. They didn't know what to do.

599
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,010
That's not how diplomat--
Just, "80 mil on the nigga head."

600
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
Like it was a WorldStar beef.

601
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,850
"Put 80 mil on his head,
20 mil for the chain."

602
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,980
I don't what's happenin'
in the world anymore.

603
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,490
And when a president
makes a move like that,

604
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,530
the president kills
the leader of another country,

605
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,200
the president gets on the news.

606
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:40,500
Matter of fact,
every channel becomes the fucking news.

607
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,460
You turn on any channel,
it's the president, from the Oval,

608
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,330
and he's like, "Hey, man,
some heinous shit went down.

609
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,800
But I'm the president,
and I had to protect y'all.

610
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,340
And I do what's right, 
and I stand for what's right,

611
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,880
so you don't ever have to worry about it
'cause I got your back.

612
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,840
President out. America's the best."

613
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,760
That's what the president does.

614
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,640
A nigga gets on Twitter...

615
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,140
...tweets the American flag
like it's a Crip bandana...

616
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:08,110
and is like, "What's cracking?
I don't like the nigga. What are you...

617
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:09,900
Who's confused?"

618
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,250
From the top of his presidency,
he's been on this shit.

619
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,960
Very early, we brought him
a serious prob--

620
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,580
We're like, "Hey, Mr. President,
kids are bringing guns to schools.

621
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,340
They're shootin' up schools.
What do we do?"

622
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,710
He was like, "Get the teachers guns, then.

623
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:36,220
Niggas bustin' at you, bust back.
That's what-- that's what I always say.

624
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,180
That's how you handle shit
in the projects."

625
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,020
Plus, I don't know, me and my girl's
dynamic is all fucked up, still.

626
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,570
Like, we gotta work out all our shit.

627
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,950
Like, right now,
we not celebratin' holidays.

628
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:58,070
We canceled all the holidays.

629
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,910
I don't fuck with none of them.
Valentine's Day, Christmas...

630
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,580
Only thing we do is birthdays.
I don't do shit else.

631
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,710
She thinks I'm being mean. I'm like,
"No, we'll celebrate the holidays again

632
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,790
when you get a job."

633
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,970
Right now, she's not workin', right?
And when I met my girl, she all the--

634
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,590
Like, It's not like my girl
don't get her shit off, but right now,

635
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,510
she just in a transition,
she not working.

636
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,270
And when I met her,
I didn't make any money.

637
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,600
I was broke. She made a lot of money.
But now, it's the opposite.

638
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,940
I make a lotta, lotta money
and she makes, like, zero money.

639
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,480
So, no, we not doin' holidays.

640
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,820
What the fuck am I gonna do a holiday with
you for? It's not fair. It's not equal.

641
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,950
We're not having equal transactions,
like two adults should.

642
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,120
Right? It's not like I buy her a Louis
bag, she buys me some Gucci shoes.

643
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,250
Holiday? No. I buy her a Louis bag

644
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,290
and then she gives me a coupon
for a back rub

645
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:49,250
like she's seven fucking years old.

646
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,800
I gotta look in her eyes, act like
this is a respectable fucking gift

647
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,550
'cause she's put me on the spot!

648
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:59,050
"This is from my heart, and I mean it."
"Bitch, I don't want a back rub from you!

649
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,050
You don't even know
how to back rub right!"

650
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,610
So, no. No holidays.
I don't want to bring a kid into this.

651
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:15,570
Now I gotta pay for her, pay for you,
do all this shit, protect you both

652
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,860
'cause she thinks that too,
'cause she's crazy.

653
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,490
You know, I get that I'm wearin'
the outfit, but, nigga, I can't fight.

654
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:27,290
Chill! These fuckin' underwears
don't give me superpowers, honey.

655
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,210
The other day, I was in the shower,

656
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:34,170
she went to the store
and she didn't lock the fuckin' door.

657
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,420
That's how I know she thinks
I can handle everything.

658
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,050
That's crazy... to leave a woman
in the shower, titties soaped up.

659
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,510
Get what I'm saying?
I'm in the shower, my titties are soapy.

660
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,770
I got soapy titties in this shower.

661
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,140
And my shit's perky. They sit...

662
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,900
I pop these shits out the bra,
they only go to here. They good.

663
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,780
These is good titties.

664
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,570
Not a lot of wear and tear
'cause I don't take a lot of dick,

665
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,240
so they not bouncin' around.

666
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,370
Solid titties.
You understand what I'm sayin'?

667
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,870
Up here. On point.

668
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:17,420
So I get out the shower, I check the door,
the shit is unlocked. I was livid!

669
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,680
Livid. I was like, "Yo, that's fucked up.
How dare you don't lock the door."

670
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,890
She was like,
"How did you even know it was unlocked?"

671
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,180
Like, "Bitch, 'cause I'm a bitch,
and I checked.

672
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,640
I'm petty, bitch.
What are you talkin' about?

673
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,390
The first thing I did, hit that lock,
see what you was on.

674
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,310
And figured out you on bullshit!"

675
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,490
She was like, "I don't get the big deal."

676
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,740
I was like, "The big deal is
whenever you're in the house

677
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,490
and I leave the house,
I lock up the house,

678
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,870
'cause that's the rules of pussy.

679
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:47,330
Pussy in the house, lock it up.

680
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:50,200
Everybody know that.
Everyone's been taught that.

681
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,410
Pussy inside, lock the pussy inside.

682
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,960
You don't leave it loose, willy-nilly,
for anything to fuckin' happen!"

683
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,960
She left me ass-naked in the shower as if
the rapist was gonna come in and be like,

684
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,090
"Nah, she got a fade.
I ain't gonna do it."

685
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,350
"What I don't do is take fade pussy.
That's off the menu.

686
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:14,560
I take all types of ass,
but not the one that's faded."

687
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:16,770
Jesus Christ!

688
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,070
The other night, we were in bed,
we both heard somethin'.

689
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,610
I said, "Babe, did you hear that?"
She's like, "Yeah, go check."

690
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,280
"Bitch, why me?

691
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,290
If there's a whole nigga in here,
we both need to go check.

692
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,210
It's gonna take two of us
to get him the fuck outta here.

693
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,880
What are you talkin' about?

694
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,420
We both might end up suckin'
this dude's dick at the end of the day.

695
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,920
And, bitch, you're on the balls,
'cause I pay the rent."

696
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,220
"I'm not suckin' balls
and payin' rent, baby girl.

697
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,970
I'm all tip then shaft.
Them balls are yours."

698
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,810
Oh, shit!

699
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,360
Then we gotta have
that goofy shit over cereal.

700
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,490
"We did what we had to do.

701
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,200
Let's not talk about the shit."

702
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,660
"But, babe,
you was really suckin' them balls."

703
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,000
Goin' down!

704
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,920
Whew!

705
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,340
Plus, I don't know,
fucking kids suck nowadays, you know?

706
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,760
I don't wanna bring a kid into this--
Every kid now, they're shitty.

707
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,430
They're all too smart. Shut up.

708
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,770
They've all got all these wild
fuckin' opinions about the world,

709
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,730
know who they are at two and shit.

710
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,150
I don't want--
I don't got the energy for that.

711
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,740
I want a dumbass kid. I want a '90s baby.

712
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,070
Put some fucking play dough in your ear
and just stare at the TV.

713
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,790
Don't want an astute fucking--

714
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,750
I do want a weird one.
I do want a little weird one, though.

715
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,710
I did think that.
I want a little Jaden Smith.

716
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,630
I want a little weird fucker. I do. I just
want a kid, I don't know what he's on.

717
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,300
Like, one day, he's a ninja,
the next day, he's gay.

718
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,260
The next day, he's into polygamy.
I'm like, "Yeah, fuck that, do it all!"

719
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,600
I want a little-- Mm! I hate when
black people don't fuck with Jaden Smith.

720
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,520
I love what... I see that as progress.
I'm like, "It's so great."

721
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,900
Like, when--
Especially hyper-masculine dudes,

722
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,650
"What they doin' to that kid?
They raisin' that kid all weird!"

723
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,530
It's like, "Yeah, that's dope!
We need a weird one.

724
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,240
Finally, we got a weird black kid.
That's amazing."

725
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,280
Like, every time I see Jaden Smith,
I feel like one of those slaves in <i>Django</i>

726
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,580
when he rode by on that horse.

727
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:42,960
I'm like, "Look at this magical nigga!
Just doin' whatever he wants."

728
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,340
This motherfucker is dressed like Batman
with no shoes on,

729
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,840
singin' about the stars,
kissin' white women in the mouth.

730
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,180
That's Martin Luther King's dream!

731
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,680
Let's celebrate that shit. That's amazing.

732
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,890
I want a little weird one.

733
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,640
I just don't want one of these
super-smart ones that knows everything.

734
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,770
Like, I don't want
a little Greta Thunberg baby.

735
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,820
I don't. I hate that little bitch.

736
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,150
I hate that little fuckin' girl,

737
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,910
and I hate that you can't say
you hate the little fuckin' girl

738
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,280
'cause she autistic or whatever.

739
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,530
That's so stupid.

740
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,450
That's so stupid. I don't hate the girl
'cause she's autistic.

741
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,000
I'm not a fuckin' savage.
I hate her 'cause she annoying,

742
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,750
and those are separate things.

743
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,080
You can be autistic and annoying, bitch.

744
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:27,130
I know plenty of autistic niggas
not annoying.

745
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,510
They know a lot about <i>Star Wars,</i>
they got facts I didn't have. It's dope.

746
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,590
This little bitch? Ugh, shut up.

747
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,850
Like, her parents gotta be exhausted.
Like, "Okay, bitch, we get it.

748
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,220
Okay. Okay.

749
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,480
Okay!"

750
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,280
I hate her attitude.

751
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:53,400
I get the message, it's the way
she's presentin' it that's fuckin' trash.

752
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,700
People wanna accept that
and be real about that.

753
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:59,410
It's like, tell the truth.
Her presentation sucks. Right?

754
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,620
I would fuck with her more
if her attitude was this.

755
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:06,710
"Everybody's fucked up.
We all messed up the planet.

756
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,760
And we all need to come together
to fix this, 'cause we all did bad."

757
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,590
But her message is,
"Adults, you fucked up.

758
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,970
Adults, you left me a bad planet.
Adults, you did wrong."

759
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,310
Bitch, the shit was fucked up for me too!
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

760
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:22,980
I didn't walk onto
a pristine Earth, bitch!

761
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,020
This shit been bad--
Matter of fact, when I was a kid,

762
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:29,570
they told me California
was gonna be gone by now, bitch.

763
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,150
Be glad that shit's still here,
motherfucker.

764
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:35,860
Dummy.

765
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,080
They've never given a fuck about
the future. No one cares about the future.

766
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,950
People care about their kids.

767
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,120
That's it. When I was seven,
I went to Disney World on a plane

768
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,460
full of cigarette smoke.

769
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,500
Coughed the whole way.
All they did was offer me Sprite.

770
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:52,510
"You want some Sprite, little nigga?"

771
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,680
"Clear that cough up,
or whatever you got goin' on."

772
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,390
Supposed to care about this bitch.
Shut up!

773
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,600
A lot of shit goin' on.
It would be weird to bring kids--

774
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,070
There's a lot of shit. I might have a kid,
she's three, and she knows she's trans.

775
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:13,440
I'm not ready for that.

776
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,400
I don't have the energy
to talk to a trans three-year-old.

777
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,740
Like, "Bitch, I don't know.
What? What are you saying?

778
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,620
I don't know. Just color with
the other color, then, bitch. Go away."

779
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,500
"Just use blue, then.
I don't fucking care!"

780
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:33,760
I don't wanna be stressed about this shit.

781
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,260
I'm not gonna act like I have the answers.
I think that's the problem.

782
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,140
We act like we have all the answers.
It's like, no, you can be confused.

783
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,890
I think sometimes, people--
Even I have this, as a queer person.

784
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:46,850
I sometimes take people's confusion
as an attack.

785
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:48,690
It's like,
no, they just don't fuckin' know.

786
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,440
I think also, sometimes, people be
confused and be attacking.

787
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:55,570
You know what I mean? You're so confused
until, like, "It ain't right!"

788
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,030
Both of those things are wrong,

789
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,160
and somewhere in the middle
is the right answer,

790
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,490
which is no one knows
what the fuck they're talkin' about.

791
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:04,580
There's a bunch of gray,
and we don't have all the answers yet,

792
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,210
'cause the world is moving faster than
fucking what we're ready to think about.

793
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:11,460
And it's okay to be uncomfortable,
it's okay to be confused.

794
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:14,050
It's not okay to say people
shouldn't have the same rights as you.

795
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,010
That's what's not okay. But you can--

796
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:18,630
You can be all the other shit,

797
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,340
'cause that's fucking human.

798
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,140
Confusion is fucking reasonable.

799
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,020
There'll be a lot of things we don't get
and a lot of questions we're gonna have.

800
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,730
My homey called me the other day,
and he was like,

801
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:34,570
"Hey, nigga, I got a question, and you
should know the answer 'cause you gay."

802
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,150
That kinda charged me up,
I'm not gonna lie.

803
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,450
I was like, "What? I'm the gayest nigga
you know. What the fuck is the question?

804
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,540
I got all the gay facts, nigga. What?"

805
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,330
And he was like, "What do you do
when you see a trans bitch

806
00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:53,210
beatin' up a regular bitch?"

807
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,460
And I was like, "Mmm? That, I don't know.

808
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,550
No, I don't have an answer for that."

809
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,970
I know some of y'all are gettin' tight.
I feel it.

810
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,310
Y'all gettin' tight, like,
"What does she mean, regular..."

811
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,430
First of all, he's not gay, he just did it
the best he could, you know?

812
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:12,440
He called everyone bitches,
so it was universal. Chill out.

813
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,530
But we really don't have
the answer to that.

814
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:21,900
That's somethin' I didn't think about
till he presented it.

815
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:26,240
What are we gonna do when trans bitches
start beatin' up regular bitches?

816
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:29,700
As a regular bitch,
I'm a tad bit concerned.

817
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,790
Not gonna lie. I don't wanna be in a fight
with one of these motherfuckers.

818
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,340
"Let them fight!"
"No, get this nigga off me."

819
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:41,590
"This motherfucker is strong in ways
I did not expect.

820
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:44,220
Please help."

821
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,480
I'm not sayin' trans women aren't women.
I'm not one of those corny-ass--

822
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,520
Trans women are women,
shut the fuck up,

823
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,320
but when one of those women's hands
is big enough to palm a football...

824
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:00,990
and she's cavin' the other woman's
chest in, we gotta make some notes...

825
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:03,360
maybe figure out a new approach,

826
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,160
how we're gonna work this shit out,
to move on as a goddamn society.

827
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,370
I hate women that don't embrace
trans women. That's corny.

828
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,500
"They're not real women."
Shut up! They're real women.

829
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,840
They're contourin', waxin' all the shit.
They're doin' everything you do, goofy.

830
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,920
Pluckin' their chin hairs, you dumbass.

831
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:24,880
Plus, what are you talkin' about?

832
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,180
Women who don't embrace trans women,
what are you saying?

833
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,430
Who do you think we are?

834
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,640
We need these super bitches.
Are you stupid?

835
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,270
These are our X-Men.

836
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,350
The world is about to change for us.

837
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,440
Get fuckin' excited.

838
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:40,440
This is a goddamn blessing.

839
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:45,240
What are you sayin'?
Lombardi Trophy, here we come!

840
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,200
We 'bout to be NFL champions, baby!

841
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,990
With these trans bitches on our team,
it's gonna be lit!

842
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,660
You thought we was gonna get
to a NFL championship

843
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,250
without these bitches, you're stupid!

844
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,500
Fuck, no, we wasn't.
I was arguing with this lady.

845
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,460
She was like, "We could do it...
regular cisgendered women... she could..."

846
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,800
Fuck you! No, they couldn't.
No, they couldn't.

847
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:05,880
Let's say, miraculously,

848
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,300
we had some cisgender woman
who gets all the way to the NFL.

849
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,220
She's never fucking been touched
all her career, right?

850
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,970
She's some flat-chested phenom.

851
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
That's what she'd have to be
to cut through the wind

852
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,900
so no one could get her,
she couldn't have no titties.

853
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,980
She's flat-chested, and she just...
bam, bam, bam, bam!

854
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,780
Her whole career, wham!
"Oh, my God, they can't touch her!" Bam!

855
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,700
Why? 'Cause she aerodynamic
'cause the titties gone. Wham!

856
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,950
Let's say this happens
in the fucking world.

857
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:33,200
She's gonna get to the NFL,
she's gonna get tackled once,

858
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,950
and the bitch is gonna die.

859
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,170
Dead.

860
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:44,920
We need a trans bitch,
high-steppin', face-maskin'.

861
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,090
Gettin' the fuck in.

862
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,550
I can't wait. I can't wait to see it.

863
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,520
She gonna be in her Fashion Nova dress,
holdin' the trophy over...

864
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,930
"Aaaaah!"

865
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:56,850
Lit.

866
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,400
Bitch lit. Triple D titties
'cause she's trans and confident.

867
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,650
Titties out to here.

868
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,690
You, ma'am, say you out--

869
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,990
say you out for a night
on the town with all your friends.

870
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:11,740
One of your friends is a trans woman.
You have the night of your life.

871
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,540
Everyone's pussy's sweaty when you leave
the club. One of those nights.

872
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:16,790
Everyone pussy sweat.
Pussy sweat all around.

873
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,290
You've sweated your pussies out dancing.
You're like, "This was the night."

874
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,550
You're standin' in front of the club,
some gross-ass dude comes up.

875
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:27,670
He's like, "Ooh, look at you sexy bitches.
I love every single one of you.

876
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,430
I would love to put my dick on every
single one of you sexy bitches' butts."

877
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:33,930
And you're like,
"What? How dare you talk to us like that?

878
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:37,060
You dirty, nasty man. Don't you ever
say anything like that to us again."

879
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,640
He's like, "What? You're just a woman.
I could break your neck."

880
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,270
And then that bitch come from the back,
Boof! "What the fuck you say?"

881
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,400
Lay that nigga out.

882
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,650
He's all confused.
"I felt dick in that punch.

883
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,410
I didn't see no dicks,
but I've been hit by a dick before."

884
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,040
Whoo!

885
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,290
There's also just too much to explain
to a fucking kid.

886
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,130
I'm gonna have to raise my kid
post-Me-Too.

887
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,140
I gotta... walk 'em down
this dumbass path, you know?

888
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,640
I gotta be like,
"This is what happened, and it was crazy,

889
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,100
but then white women went stupid."

890
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,020
You know?

891
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,900
I was all-- I was Me Too-ed up.
I was like, "Get these nasty niggas.

892
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:28,440
Get 'em off the streets.
They got their dicks on everybody.

893
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:29,610
Get 'em outta here.

894
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,160
I don't like none of that.
Get 'em outta here. Get 'em outta here.

895
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,950
Get 'em outta here." 
And then white women went crazy.

896
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,290
I feel like it just stopped
bein' about, like, what was real.

897
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,870
You know, like, there's a part--
there's a two-level conversation.

898
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,290
Yes. All these dudes in power were using
their power to manipulate situations

899
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:48,380
and be terrible to women,
a hundred percent.

900
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,220
But in all those situations,
women had a choice.

901
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,010
If we never speak to that choice,
we are disempowering women.

902
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,310
The most empowering thing
is to know even in the dire straits,

903
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,850
you have a choice.

904
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,600
You can always choose,
and sometimes choosing to say "Fuck you"

905
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,190
- is the most illest choice you can make.
- Yo!

906
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:08,900
And if we don't pass that down

907
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,900
to young women,
then what the fuck are we saying?

908
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,490
It's weird. So I had to stop--

909
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,280
I was like, "I can't be a part
of this shit. This is goofy."

910
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,660
I was done with it
when it landed on Aziz Ansari.

911
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,700
That's when I was really like,
"Fuck this."

912
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,580
When it got to Aziz, I said,
"I can't do this anymore. Really?"

913
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,830
And it's not 'cause I'm defendin' Aziz.
I wasn't there.

914
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,380
I'm not sayin' he did or didn't.
That has nothin' to do with it.

915
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:31,630
There's not a woman in here who doesn't
think she could beat that nigga's ass.

916
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,260
That's what I'm sayin'.

917
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:35,840
That was goofy to me.

918
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,930
The end of that blog should've been, "Then
I punched that dumb nigga in the face...

919
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:43,100
and left his goddamn apartment."

920
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:46,560
You ain't even got to punch Aziz.
Just buck at that nigga.

921
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,730
"Ugh, get the fuck out of here. Goofy!"

922
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,860
We gotta teach girls to fight. I'm not
taking a L off a 5′5″ Indian nigga.

923
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,330
5′5″ Indian niggas,
swing at them!

924
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,580
I'm not saying Indian niggas are soft,
but I ain't never heard this statement.

925
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,920
"That Indian nigga beat my ass."
I ain't never heard that.

926
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:10,420
So, I'ma take my goddamn chances.

927
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,510
I feel the same way about feminism.

928
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,720
It's like, ugh! I wanna say
I'm a feminist, but white women...

929
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,810
Yeah!

930
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,100
Whoo!

931
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,730
Y'all make it so hard
to get along with shit!

932
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,360
'Cause white women act like they're--
like it's a brand of feminism,

933
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,240
and it's theirs
and that's the most dominant.

934
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,450
They act like they're about all women,
but you're not.

935
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,910
You're only about white women.
And that's fine.

936
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:44,620
You can't be about all women,

937
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,830
you haven't taken the time
to figure out all women need.

938
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:48,330
You just know your white women needs

939
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,420
and assume if we fix your shit,
it'll trickle down.

940
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,000
It's like, no, bitch!

941
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,380
And I'm not mad at white women
being agenda-driven. Be about your shit.

942
00:50:57,470 --> 00:51:00,510
Be about your shit. But don't mask it
as a cause. Just be real.

943
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,260
Be like a Jehovah's Witness.

944
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,810
Come knockin' on my door on a Sunday,

945
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,980
like, "Are you ready
for white women's return?"

946
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,480
"Well, I got somethin' you should read."

947
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,360
Whoo!

948
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,190
Plus, if you want me
to get behind feminism,

949
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,190
start with somethin'
that's gonna galvanize women.

950
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,490
Start with somethin'
that's really gonna change some shit.

951
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,490
Start with teachin' women
how to pee standin' up.

952
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,950
- How come we not doin' that shit yet?
- Whoo!

953
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:26,500
It's 2020!
How come we still peein' hobbled over

954
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,710
like dogs and toddlers and shit?

955
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,080
Fuckin' grown women!

956
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,130
We should be peeing upright like men.
Know what? We can do it.

957
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,460
And you know how I know? I fuckin' did it.

958
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:38,630
I got tired of this shit one day.
I stood over the toilet,

959
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,970
I spread my pussy lips, I perked my hole
up, and that bitch went straight.

960
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:44,760
And I was like, "Holy shit!"

961
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,270
"I could've been doin' this
the whole fuckin' time?"

962
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,110
- Whoo!
- "How did I not know this shit?"

963
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,900
I'll tell you why I didn't know.
'Cause of how women are taught to pee.

964
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,240
How we're taught to pee is fucked up.
It's trash. Especially in public.

965
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,990
You know how we're taught to pee?
"Pull the pussy out! Put it away!

966
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:06,950
Get out the bathroom,
the rapist is coming. Move, move, move!

967
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,330
You ain't got time
to hang out in here, bitch. Go!"

968
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:14,080
Meanwhile, as soon as dudes see
their dicks, they're stretchin' 'em,

969
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,710
wrappin' 'em around they leg,

970
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:18,630
puttin' them in they butt,
seein' how far they snap back,

971
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:19,720
figurin' shit out.

972
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,260
There's a grown woman in here.

973
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:26,930
Grown as fuck, 35-plus,
and every time she pee in public,

974
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,180
a little pee go down her leg,
and into her shoe.

975
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,440
Grown!

976
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,150
She just laughed back there. Grown!

977
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,320
Piss in her shoe. Every time.
Confused. "Why does this keep happenin'?"

978
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,860
I'll tell you why, goofy.

979
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,200
'Cause you walk around all day,
shit is movin' around down there.

980
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,700
You're too scared to touch anything,
you whip it out and piss,

981
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,160
and now you got piss in your right shoe,
you clown!

982
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:53,670
Meanwhile, dudes have been
standin' upright for centuries,

983
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,420
spellin' their names in the snow!

984
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,590
And you're walkin' around with piss in
your shoe, and you want equal fuckin' pay.

985
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,380
Shut up!

986
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,100
Even when you go into the men's bathroom,
it's different, bro.

987
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,680
They free in there. I go in there
sometimes. I get away with it.

988
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,890
They free in that motherfucker.
They don't care.

989
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,400
They got little games in the urinal,

990
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,400
they be peein' on ice and shit,
movin' it around.

991
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:18,190
Fuckin' around.

992
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:22,490
Dicks out, talkin' wage gap,
changin' the world.

993
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:27,700
Even the stall where they shit,
sometimes, it don't have a door.

994
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:30,490
There's no door on the stall.
Why? Because they free.

995
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:33,290
They're like, "Shit happens back here,
and if you don't wanna see shit,

996
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,620
don't be in this goddamn corner.

997
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,500
I don't need a door.

998
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,710
Just don't come back here if you don't
wanna look at nobody shittin', you fool."

999
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:44,630
Meanwhile, in women's bathrooms,
we're hobbled in closets,

1000
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,800
you know what I mean?

1001
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,680
Can't even move around. I got tired
of this shit one day. I cracked the door.

1002
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,270
I said, "I'm not takin' this shit anymore.
It's too tight in here.

1003
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm peeing with the door cracked.
I can't take it."

1004
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,690
And then this woman walked in,
she swung the door open.

1005
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:00,320
'Cause of course, she assumed
the stall was free. That was natural.

1006
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,320
What was unnatural is she saw me,
she screamed,

1007
00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:05,360
as if we both don't have pussies

1008
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,450
and we both don't know
what goes on in the bathroom,

1009
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,990
and she tried to jam the door closed.

1010
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:11,990
But I held that bitch open.
I said, "Mm-mm, baby girl. Don't do that.

1011
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:18,460
Make eye contact with me.
This is the revolution right here."

1012
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:28,090
My girl talked about kids a lot...
while we was traveling.

1013
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,430
That was pissing me off.

1014
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,850
'Cause we was just travelin',
being free lesbians.

1015
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:33,890
We was just bumpin' pussies. You know?

1016
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,190
Just bumpin' pussies,
not worried about none of the rules.

1017
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:41,650
She kept bringin' this fucking corny
heteronormative shit into my life.

1018
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,440
"Don't you want kids? Kids?

1019
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,490
Wouldn't this be so much better
if we were experiencing this with kids?"

1020
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:50,990
"Bitch, no! No, it wouldn't be better.
I don't want fucking kids. Shut up.

1021
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:55,040
Shut up. I don't know,
maybe I'll do it, but not..." Mm!

1022
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,790
Mm, I got a lot of nephews.
I'm all right.

1023
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,880
You know?

1024
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,550
I don't fucking... Plus, when I do
have a kid, I'ma buy a Asian baby.

1025
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,010
I already have a plan.

1026
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:09,220
I'm buyin' a dope-ass Asian baby.
I already know what I'm doin'.

1027
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,930
Give this motherfucker a Mohawk.

1028
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,470
Take him dippin' and trippin', you know?

1029
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,560
'Cause, like, kids cost money
when you a fuckin' gay person.

1030
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,600
When somethin' costs money,
you know what costs the most,

1031
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:21,690
and I need to stunt.

1032
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,860
I need to pull up with my Asian baby,
hop out in that foreign--

1033
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,690
"What up, nigga? Look at this."

1034
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:34,580
Take him to the park, shit on
my frenemies, you know what I mean?

1035
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,370
I can't wait. I can't wait
to wheel this little nigga round the park.

1036
00:55:37,450 --> 00:55:39,620
"Oh, hey, Karen, you adopted, too?

1037
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,380
Where's your baby from?

1038
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,960
Honduras? Broke bitch!

1039
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,510
Get that broke-bitch baby
outta here, Karen.

1040
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:52,220
This motherfucker right here?
He's from Thailand.

1041
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,220
Matter of fact, he might be a she.

1042
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,520
Take three months
to figure that out, bitch."

1043
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,490
A fucking kid... Maybe I'll do it.
I don't know. I probably will,

1044
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,780
'cause she wants one,
and who cares, right?

1045
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,740
Eventually,
"Just fuckin' fine. Have one. Whatever."

1046
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,040
Plus, I don't know, you need 'em.
They represent you when... You know.

1047
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,330
You make 'em so they can be like,
"That nigga was here."

1048
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,420
You know?

1049
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,460
You die, you hope your kid's still alive
to be like, "They were a person."

1050
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,920
You know, just represent you.

1051
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:29,630
I will do-- I don't know.

1052
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,840
I just think I'ma be bad at the shit,
you know? Nobody's good.

1053
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,390
Every parent sucks.

1054
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,970
If you're out here and you're parenting,
you're trash.

1055
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,520
No one does it right.
Everyone fucks their kids up.

1056
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,690
Everyone makes a fucked-up, fucked-up kid.

1057
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,770
Everyone's doin' a little bit
to fuckin' damage the child.

1058
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:46,610
'Cause you were damaged,
so how could you not,

1059
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:48,980
how could you not pass on the damage
that was given to you?

1060
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:51,280
It's just impossible.
But you just keep enough of it.

1061
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,620
Like, "I could really fuck you up, but I'm
only fucking you up a little, 'cause...

1062
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,200
there's a lot that could go wrong,
'cause I'm really fucked up."

1063
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,450
And you cough what you can,

1064
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,330
but everybody's doin' a shitty job.

1065
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,210
Everybody. The only way you know
you're doing an all right job

1066
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,090
is if your kids never
tell you you were shitty,

1067
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,920
'cause then they loved you,
and you raised compassionate kids.

1068
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,930
If your kids are never like,
"Hey, you fucked me up,"

1069
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:17,640
but just like, "You did a great job,"
then you just raised good kids,

1070
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,020
'cause they don't wanna tell you
the truth and hurt your feelings.

1071
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:25,060
If you got a kid who's 40,
still like, "I fuckin' hate you!"

1072
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,360
you did a terrible job.

1073
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:29,820
That, and if you lose one of them niggas,
then--

1074
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,650
then you really failed.
I think about that all the time.

1075
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:36,110
I don't wanna be one of the ones
that lose one of them niggas,

1076
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,990
'cause people be losin' their kids...

1077
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,620
You lose one at a store, bitch, you suck.

1078
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,210
Shit!

1079
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:49,960
But I know I'll be bad.

1080
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,920
I'ma be bad, 'cause no one--
no one does this shit right.

1081
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,760
Everyone fucks it up a tad.

1082
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,220
No one trusts their parents.

1083
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,310
No one in here fully,
a hundred percent trusted their parents,

1084
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:05,600
'cause you seen your parents
do fucked-up shit.

1085
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,900
You've heard 'em have
fucked-up arguments, you know?

1086
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,650
You've seen their lives be in shambles
when they thought they were keeping you

1087
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,360
from their lives being in shambles.

1088
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,740
They were trying to have those
late-night conversations,

1089
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,910
which is, for a kid, like 10:30 at night.

1090
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,370
That's when parents
think it's time to talk for real.

1091
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,170
'Cause they're dumb. It's like,
no one's asleep at 10:30, you idiot.

1092
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,710
You're not asleep at 10:30.
Everyone's wide awake.

1093
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:35,090
They're like, "Now's the time to talk
about it. Get down to the bottom of shit."

1094
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:39,050
Everyone's heard their parents
yellin' about some bullshit,

1095
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,760
like a $99 cable bill.

1096
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,220
"How are we gonna pay this?"
"Your mother sucks!" "What is my house?

1097
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,480
I can't trust anyone
in this motherfucker."

1098
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:50,860
'Cause parents like to present it
like they got everything together.

1099
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:53,780
That's the problem. Don't lie.
Stop coming like you got everything--

1100
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,450
You're not good.
Most of you start, 30 when you start.

1101
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:59,240
I'm 38. If I had a kid at 30,
that nigga would be dead.

1102
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,280
You don't know what you're doin'.
Be honest.

1103
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:05,000
"Hey, I don't know what I'm doin',
but I'ma try to keep you alive.

1104
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,250
Sometimes, I'm not gonna be able to,
so look out for yourself, little nigga.

1105
00:59:09,290 --> 00:59:11,670
And let's-- let's rock out."

1106
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,710
"Let's see if we make it."

1107
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,210
Whoo!

1108
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:19,010
But, no, parents,
"I got everything under control."

1109
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,550
Fuck you. No, you don't.

1110
00:59:22,930 --> 00:59:25,720
I remember I heard my mom and my dad

1111
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:28,390
tryin' to have a fight
about my dad usin' crack.

1112
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:30,310
And my dad...

1113
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,520
My dad...

1114
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,940
My mom was tryin' to whisper, you know?

1115
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,030
She was tryin' to have a whisper-fight
with the nigga, but you can't whisper

1116
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,240
to a crackhead.

1117
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,950
They're loud as fuck.

1118
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:44,280
So, my mom's whisperin',
and then my dad goes,

1119
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,160
"Who seen me do the crack?"

1120
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,120
Which means, nigga here did it.

1121
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,340
Now you're just tryin'
to identify witnesses. Are they credible?

1122
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,960
Are they not credible?
But you fucking did it!

1123
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,180
Now I'ma tell my mom about a problem?

1124
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,810
Bitch, there's whole crack in the house.
We got bigger issues!

1125
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:16,230
<i>Stranger Things </i>is a whole show
about kids not trusting their parents.

1126
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,280
Like, if a Demogorgon's after you,
tell your mom!

1127
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,950
These little niggas is like, "All I got
is these walkie-talkies and these bikes.

1128
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:27,620
They're my best friends.
'Cause that bitch can't handle shit."

1129
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,090
I remember when I was 11, I thought
I was gonna be abducted by aliens.

1130
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:39,130
I did. I was convinced, you know?

1131
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,800
I was like,
"Aliens are comin' to get my ass."

1132
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:45,470
And it's because, when I was 11,
I grew up in the '90s.

1133
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,310
If you grew up in the '90s,
you know aliens was a big thing.

1134
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:51,430
It was huge. It was big shit. It was.

1135
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,650
There was <i>Outer Limits,</i>
there was <i>X-Files,</i>

1136
01:00:55,110 --> 01:00:58,230
there was <i>Unsolved Mysteries,</i>
and then every once in a while,

1137
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:01,030
the History Channel would just be like,
"Did they build the pyramids?"

1138
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:03,740
And just fuck your head up
on a Wednesday night.

1139
01:01:03,820 --> 01:01:07,280
Just throw a whole curveball at your ass.
"What? They could've built the pyramids?"

1140
01:01:07,370 --> 01:01:10,200
"Crop circles. Were they here?"
"Oh, my God!"

1141
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,290
So I was fuckin' stressed out.

1142
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,420
And I got in the shower one day,
and I felt my leg pulsate a little bit.

1143
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,050
I was like, "That's the tracker.
That's where them niggas is gon'--

1144
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,090
That's how they're gonna get your girl."

1145
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:28,560
So I started doin' karate
in my room at night. "Yah! Aah!

1146
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:31,350
"Waah!" Watchin' <i>Last Dragon </i>and shit.
"Eeh! Eeh! Ugh!"

1147
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:36,150
Started sleepin' with a knife
and a hammer under my pillow.

1148
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,030
Every night, sleeping with a knife
and hammer under my pillow,

1149
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,480
ready for the action, you know?

1150
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:44,530
I was like, "When they come,
stab 'em, bash 'em, stab 'em, bash 'em."

1151
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:49,030
Then, one day, I go in my room.

1152
01:01:49,830 --> 01:01:52,000
My mom's sittin' on my bed.

1153
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,790
She's like, "We need to talk."
I'm like, "What's up?"

1154
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,330
And she's like, "Who's hurtin' you?"
I was like, "What?"

1155
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,920
She's like, "Tell me right now.
Who's coming in here at night

1156
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,130
and doin' something to you?"

1157
01:02:02,210 --> 01:02:04,720
I was like, "What are you talkin' about?"
She's like, "Look at me.

1158
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:08,470
I don't care if it's your father,
I don't care if it's one of your brothers.

1159
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:12,930
You need to tell me right now,
who's doing something to you?"

1160
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,480
Which, what a mom, bro. Word!

1161
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:19,020
'Cause my mother showed me,
"I got your back, no matter fuckin' what."

1162
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,230
Like, what a big move.

1163
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,740
'Cause what if it was
one of my brothers or my father?

1164
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:28,490
That's a crazy thing
to have to hear as a mother,

1165
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:31,240
but she was ready
to take that shit for me.

1166
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,580
She was like, "Tell me."

1167
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,870
And I looked my mom in the eye,

1168
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,380
and I told her how
I was gonna be abducted by aliens.

1169
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,380
Because I'm a genius.

1170
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:47,800
And you could see in her eyes that
a part of her wished I was bein' molested.

1171
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:51,640
'Cause that would've been
easier to process.

1172
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,430
And if you don't think
that fucked me up a little bit...

1173
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,520
Hey, y'all were dope as fuck.
Have a good night.
