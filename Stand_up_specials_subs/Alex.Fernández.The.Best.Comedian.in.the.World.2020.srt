00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:12,220
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL COMEDY SPECIAL

2
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:43,877
ALEX FERNÁNDEZ

3
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,870
THE BEST COMEDIAN IN THE WORLD

4
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,331
Let's begin with the jokes, okay?

5
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,628
I'm Alex Fernández,
and I'm the best comedian in the world.

6
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,590
Thank you very much.

7
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,800
Yes.

8
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,511
What's so funny, man?

9
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,722
It's okay.

10
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,849
When I said that,
I know some of you thought,

11
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,227
"Wait till I open Twitter.

12
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,898
The minute I step out of here,
he'll hear me out."

13
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,275
Fine, I know you don't believe me.

14
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,444
It's hard to make you believe
I'm the best comedian in the world,

15
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,570
but it's my job...

16
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,489
Convincing you is my job.

17
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,573
This wasn't easy.

18
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,826
It started when I quit my job

19
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,287
after seven years working in an office.
Seven years.

20
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,206
Seven years.

21
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,918
It's a hell of a lot. Seven years!
It's a lot.

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,672
Have you done something for seven years
other than existing? It's a lot.

23
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,176
That's why elementary school is six years.
It's more than enough.

24
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,805
One day, I couldn't take it anymore
and told my boss,

25
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,724
"Boss, we need to talk.
Let's go to a conference room."

26
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,853
We went to a conference room
and I told her straight out,

27
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,397
"Boss, I'm here to..."
No, I didn't punch her.

28
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,817
No, it's communication. Someone
from Sonora might say, "Punch her!"

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,860
No, wait...

30
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,364
It's communication. I told her, "Boss,

31
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,367
I'm quitting. I'm going to be a comedian."

32
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,536
And my boss said two words

33
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,955
I never forget when I'm on stage,

34
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,249
which I carry with me tonight
just as all other nights...

35
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,251
She said, "Fuck, man!"

36
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,090
The woman said, "Fuck, man!"

37
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,344
'Cause she didn't believe me.
And why didn't she?

38
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,973
I didn't know, but two weeks earlier,
someone else had quit

39
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,558
saying he wanted to be a wrestler.

40
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,605
Just like that.

41
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,649
My former boss
was the well of broken dreams.

42
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,485
Everyone threw coins at her.

43
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,530
"I don't want to be an accountant anymore,
I want to be an astronaut."

44
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:25,788
I found it poetic.
I was a wrestling fan when I was little.

45
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,041
Mexican wrestling, such showmanship!

46
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,250
I will never forget,

47
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,379
for example, when my brother took me
to the Arena México for the first time.

48
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,422
It's a wonderful place.

49
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,841
If you're not from Mexico City,
when you come here,

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,551
keep an eye on your belongings, but...

51
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,681
go to the Arena México,
it's a wonderful place.

52
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,893
So, I remember when I went there,
I couldn't believe it. It was like...

53
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,102
"Hey, brother!

54
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,899
This is where they live!"

55
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,569
I was so naive, so innocent.

56
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,573
I had the action figures and the ring.
When I finished playing,

57
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,699
I'd keep them underneath.

58
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,910
To me, that's where they all lived.

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,537
Under the ring.

60
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,165
Perro Aguayo, his wife,
all of them lying there.

61
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,087
I can't believe the spectacle I'm seeing.

62
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,630
And there, in a corner of the ring,

63
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,507
is Místico, glowing.

64
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,176
Místico, glowing like this.

65
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,553
Picture his ass. There he was, like this.

66
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,890
There was Místico.

67
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,600
Because Místico shines, right?

68
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,769
His mask, his pants, his chest.

69
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,937
No one knows why...

70
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,191
but his chest shines,
the motherfucker sweats glitter.

71
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,194
His son must be really happy.

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,072
"Dad, I finished my school project."
"Let me decorate it, Son. There.

73
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,702
An 'M' is still missing. There you go."

74
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,746
No.

75
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,797
And my brother tells me, "That's not all.

76
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,883
You can interact with the wrestlers."
I didn't know that.

77
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,218
It was my first time there.

78
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,971
And it may be very <i>chilango,</i>
it's a Mexico City thing.

79
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,681
If you're not from there,
you won't get it.

80
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,309
Did anyone come from far away?

81
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,144
From northern Mexico?

82
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,687
Where are you from?

83
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,398
-From McAllen, Texas.
-McAllen, Texas.

84
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,277
Oh, from Monterrey, right?

85
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,572
From...

86
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:29,120
Okay, from McAllen, Texas, great.

87
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,122
Where else do you come from? You?

88
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,958
One said Nuevo León,
the other said Monterrey.

89
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,126
There's a problem there.

90
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,796
One of you is denying your origin.

91
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,633
"I'm from the entire state of Nuevo León,
saves you the trouble."

92
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,345
Okay, fine. Look, this is so <i>chilango.</i>

93
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,679
You won't get it, but...

94
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,598
this guy steps up there.

95
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,891
Místico is in the ring,

96
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,810
and he starts yelling at him,
greeting him halfway through the match.

97
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,313
"Místico!

98
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,704
Místico!

99
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,249
Místico!"

100
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,086
But Místico wouldn't turn his way.

101
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,589
There he was, ignoring him...

102
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,134
showing everyone his ass.

103
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,845
A checkmark on each buttock.
There he was.

104
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,473
"Místico!

105
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,725
Místico!

106
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:34,936
Místico!"

107
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,271
And Místico wouldn't turn around.

108
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,857
That's what makes him mystical, I guess.

109
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,152
"Místico!

110
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,531
Místico!

111
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,782
Místico!"

112
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,075
So Místico turns around.

113
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,747
And the guy tells him,
"Fuck you, Místico!"

114
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,375
What a moment!

115
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,419
My Mexico.

116
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,140
I know it's a very <i>chilango </i>thing.

117
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,602
Here, in Mexico City,
we yell at each other all the time.

118
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,312
I know you didn't get the joke.

119
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,359
Don't worry, I have the exact same joke

120
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,820
Monterrey version, just for you.

121
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,407
Tonight, same joke...

122
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,910
Monterrey version,
just for the two of you.

123
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,705
An insult for the rest of you here,

124
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,624
but a prize for you. Tonight...

125
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:40,751
same joke,

126
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,128
Monterrey version.

127
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:43,880
Same joke...

128
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,175
but Monterrey version. Exactly.

129
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,802
"Místico!

130
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,311
Místico!

131
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,855
Místico!"

132
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,523
And Místico wouldn't turn around.

133
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,695
There he was, showing his ass,
ignoring him.

134
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,115
A checkmark on each buttock.

135
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,034
"Místico!

136
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,244
Místico!

137
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,079
Místico!"

138
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,873
And Místico wouldn't turn around.

139
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,626
That's what makes him mystical, I guess.

140
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,095
"Místico!

141
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:40,686
Místico!"

142
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,104
Místico turns around...

143
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,984
and the guy says, "Fuck you, you pussy!"

144
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:47,985
There you go.

145
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,031
What a moment!

146
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,667
I'm growing up. I'm...

147
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,005
As the best comedian in the world,
I'm growing up.

148
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,883
I've discovered what being grown-up is.

149
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,926
I know what it is.

150
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,971
It's realizing you did stupid things
when you were little. That's growing up.

151
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,848
If you think you didn't do stupid things
when you were little,

152
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,934
it's because you're still immature.

153
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,812
We're so stupid.

154
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,147
We are born stupid.
That's why kids go to school,

155
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,732
to shed their stupidity.

156
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,777
Nature is wise.

157
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,028
It knows...

158
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,238
we're stupid.

159
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,073
That's why it shelters us, it protects us.

160
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,200
Raise your hand, don't be shy...

161
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,704
if you are or know a kid

162
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,872
that fell off a first floor
and came out unharmed.

163
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,666
Where are my boys?

164
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,710
Okay, we have a few.

165
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,379
My pal with the glasses here.
Hi, what's your name?

166
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,214
Emanuel.

167
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,049
Did you fall or was it some other kid?

168
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,218
It was you, wasn't it? Of course!

169
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,222
Make it a point, "I'm the one who fell."

170
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,308
Okay. How did you fall, Emanuel?

171
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,436
You fell...

172
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:04,812
down the stairs.

173
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,939
Oh, there were no stairs.

174
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,778
Just like a puppy... I didn't get it.

175
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,741
You were on a first floor?

176
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,453
It was a ladder and they took it away.
Where did you live?

177
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,998
In a Lego house or something?

178
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,086
And your memory didn't register...

179
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,339
So he said, "The ladder is still there."

180
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,801
And down you go.

181
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,386
How old were you...

182
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,348
when this happened? Six? Okay.

183
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,308
Your parents were such morons, right?

184
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,270
They just thought,
"Take the ladder away, what could happen?

185
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,650
The kid knows. The kid can see.
He'll be all right."

186
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,739
But nothing happened to you,
right, Emanuel? Luckily, you're here.

187
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,907
I'm so glad. And look...

188
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,534
I'm not saying a kid falling is funny.

189
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,286
On the contrary, it's very funny.

190
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,040
It's true when they say,
"They're made of rubber."

191
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,376
A kid falls, and he bounces.

192
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,258
And...

193
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,408
"Let's get
some Delaware Punch or something."

194
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,244
They just ignore it.

195
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,463
But the mom is hysterical, "He fell!

196
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,341
My little Emanuel fell!

197
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,096
From the first floor, the ladder
was gone. I don't know, he fell.

198
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,892
We took it away to clean it.
I don't know what happened!

199
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,896
I'm shocked.

200
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,899
Shocked. Look, feel me.

201
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,236
Yes, he was in his uniform.
He's such a moron, he'll get it dirty!

202
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,448
Tomorrow is everyday uniform!"

203
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,326
That can happen to a kid.

204
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,454
And the odds nothing will happen are high.

205
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,831
On the other hand,
an elderly can't fall like that.

206
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,544
Yes. It's not that old people are wise,
they're just careful not to fall.

207
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,257
There comes an age when falling
and Ebola are not that different.

208
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,803
At the same level. I'm not saying
it's funny when an old man falls.

209
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,013
It's very funny because...

210
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,681
it's slow.

211
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,019
Introduction, conflict, conclusions.

212
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,439
Questions, answers,
everything happens there.

213
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,150
So he's... "Well, here we are.

214
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,281
Another day, another dollar. Bring it on!

215
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,619
It'll take me all day to get to the store.
Let's do it!

216
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,954
Damn it!

217
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,628
Damn!
What's this mysterious stone pavement?

218
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,424
What's going on?
I miscalculated. No, what the...?

219
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,473
Yes, it's started.

220
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,768
The fall has started.

221
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,103
Day one.

222
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:37,191
It's like leaning down, but faster.
Here we go.

223
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,735
Can anyone please help me?

224
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,029
Help! I'm in uniform too!

225
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,407
But my supermarket stacker uniform!
Please help!"

226
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,539
My point here is it's good to share
our stupidity

227
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,166
because we grow up.
Emanuel, today you've become...

228
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,461
a grown-up. Congratulations.

229
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,589
So, I'll share one of my favorite
stupid moments with you,

230
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,216
my first drunken binge.

231
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,094
It happened when I was 16.

232
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,137
If you're under age, don't drink.

233
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,683
Stay away from drugs.
Don't do anything. Don't exist.

234
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,603
It's a horrible age, 16.

235
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,898
A story with three main characters:
Alex Fernández and two of his friends.

236
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,401
One is Miguel.
The other guy's name isn't this one,

237
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,237
but after that, that's how we called him,
Vomitrón.

238
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,867
Alex Fernández, Miguel and Vomitrón.
The three of us, hanging out.

239
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,036
We're ready for adventure.
We have movie tickets.

240
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,372
And, all of a sudden,
Miguel had this spark of stupidity.

241
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,709
You know that spark?

242
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,336
It comes from here, this brain lobe.

243
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,422
This is where all stupidity comes from.

244
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,050
Right? The side of the brain
that makes you say things like,

245
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,720
"What if we drive down the footpath?"

246
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,433
What did Miguel's master plan consist of?
It was very simple.

247
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,644
They'd drop us at the movie theater,
we'd pretend we go in,

248
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,605
but would go to a store,

249
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,316
buy alcohol, then grab a cab,

250
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,775
go to Gordo's party,

251
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,570
ingest all the alcohol
we could drink in 45 minutes...

252
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,699
and go back to the movie theater.
Nothing could go wrong.

253
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,995
Not even the PRI knew this con.

254
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,498
Bulletproof. I mean it.

255
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,417
So, they dropped us at the movies,

256
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,461
we pretend we go in.

257
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,088
Smaller, kind of...

258
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,676
We took a cab and went to an Oxxo,

259
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,762
bought really cheap alcohol,

260
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,055
this vodka...

261
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,765
It was a while ago,
there was no Four Loko.

262
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,851
The young ones laugh.

263
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,688
The older audience goes, "Four Loko?
You're <i>loco,</i> I don't get it."

264
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:43,859
Don't worry.

265
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,111
I'll explain.

266
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,991
Four Loko is a horrible beverage

267
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:53,494
you can either drink
or mop the floor with.

268
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,455
We bought this cheap vodka,

269
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,375
this cheap vodka which, at a distance,

270
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,169
seemed to have
some Russian guy on the label...

271
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:06,465
dressed in fur, killing a moose.

272
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,759
Vodkinski, here!

273
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,471
But you look closer and,
"Oh, no, it's a Monterrey dude."

274
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,767
In a fur coat. "Boy, it's freezing!"

275
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,228
Monterrinski.

276
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,981
Some grape juice,

277
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,692
which wasn't even grape juice,
it was this disgusting purple thing.

278
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,527
Some nibbles,

279
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,030
and off we go to Gordo's party,
which was for teenagers.

280
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,991
Are there any teenagers here tonight?

281
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,619
I hate you.

282
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,623
The worst time of my life. It's horrible.

283
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,542
You're horny all day.

284
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:46,171
You have no money, no self-esteem.
You have nothing, it's horrible.

285
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,801
So we get to Gordo's party.

286
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,886
At that age, we all want to be grown-ups.

287
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,888
It's horrible.
So the girls there are going...

288
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,776
"Like, I hate it.

289
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,280
I hate biology.

290
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,034
It's so hard and useless.

291
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,578
I hate it. Oh, it's upside down...
Like, I'm so stupid."

292
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,708
Everyone's there, dancing,

293
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,502
but weird, kind of in a circle,
as if it were a ritual.

294
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,797
Two dance at the center,

295
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,008
humiliate themselves, go back.
That's right.

296
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,264
And there you are, all stupid...

297
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,450
You know what's worse?
There was always this jokester

298
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,244
who'd do his jokes on the dance floor,
and everyone loved him.

299
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,830
"Is Carlitos coming? I hope he is."
"Carlitos is the best."

300
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:02,790
"There he is."

301
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,171
"I hope he does the taco seller dance."

302
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,217
"With pineapple, Carlitos."

303
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,428
"Carlitos is the best."

304
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,765
"Too bad he's adopted."

305
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,144
Kids are so cruel.

306
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,314
A big hand to all adopted kids!

307
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,441
Wherever you are.

308
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,905
Adopt, don't buy. So...

309
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,289
Here we are, at Gordo's drunken binge.

310
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,917
We drank all the alcohol we could.

311
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,836
One liter between the three of us.

312
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,629
Checked!

313
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,173
That's when I felt it kicked.

314
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,842
For the first time in my life,

315
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,386
I felt this beast coming out of my belly.

316
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,263
It kind of...

317
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,181
surges out from here.

318
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,183
And takes control of your life for good.

319
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,563
"Here I am, Alejandro, I'm alcohol."

320
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,401
"What are you doing?"
"I'll be here until you get a divorce."

321
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,697
"Everything is spinning, I'm not.
What's going on? Help!"

322
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,450
But I swear it was going fine.

323
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,952
They drop us at the movies.

324
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,080
Everything's just as planned.
We're at the movies, hammered.

325
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,217
"What, lady?

326
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,638
What are you staring at? What? Get a life!

327
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,850
I love life! Gimme a kiss."

328
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,440
But we forgot one tiny detail,
Vomitrón's mom was picking us up.

329
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,441
So she pulls over.

330
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,111
I don't know what we were thinking,
that a carriage would pick us up?

331
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,155
So Vomitrón's mom pulls over.

332
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,698
The three of us were hammered.

333
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,408
And that's when the problem began.

334
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,243
That's when the stupidity started.

335
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,455
"We're hammered, man! Why did we do this?"

336
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,748
"What now?"

337
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,917
"Put coins in your mouth, it'll go away."

338
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,796
We're there, like piggy banks.

339
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,674
Thank God for our savings!

340
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,387
Until Miguel rises from the ashes,

341
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,430
like the Phoenix.

342
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,433
"Relax...

343
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,358
I have a plan.

344
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,903
We can outwit this 47-year-old woman.

345
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,074
No fucking sweat.

346
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,327
Vomitrón, I'll outwit your mom.

347
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,374
I have a plan.
Let's just hold our breath."

348
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,754
"See?" "All right."

349
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,672
"Perfect."

350
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,981
"How was the movie?"
"Oh, sorry, we're hammered!"

351
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,443
Our plan lasted ten seconds.

352
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,619
Vomitrón's mom got mad.

353
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,664
She asked the obvious question,
"You drank?" We said no.

354
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,002
For that's when negotiation
with the grown-up starts.

355
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,755
Yes, first you go, "No, we didn't drink."
And as the grown-up gets angrier...

356
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,092
you fuel up the negotiation.

357
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,428
This is how great empires were founded.

358
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,680
The fucking Mayan Empire,
that's how it started.

359
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,808
"Did you drink?" "No, stupid woman!"

360
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,855
"You didn't? The motherfucker
is shirtless!" "Okay...

361
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,901
<i>touché!</i>

362
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,279
We may...

363
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,989
We just may have...

364
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,365
had a drink.

365
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,076
A little tiny one, with three straws.

366
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,203
Not regular straws,
the thin ones for coffee, ma'am."

367
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,414
Turtles didn't go ballistic back then,
come on!

368
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,499
"We only had one."

369
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,293
"One? You reek!"

370
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,378
"Okay, a medium-sized drink. Satisfied?"

371
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,674
So there we were, negotiating,
and I make a pause

372
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,136
to read the situation.
We were in a horrible Cutlass,

373
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,639
an ugly old Cutlass.

374
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,559
Being a Cutlass,
it already smelled like booze...

375
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:37,022
out of the dealer's.
"Look, it smells like brandy, see?"

376
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,653
We were in the Cutlass, it starts raining.
Vomitrón's mom won't stop screaming.

377
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,198
And Vomitrón is sitting there,
receiving the information.

378
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,328
"Yes, Mom."

379
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,788
Miguel is falling asleep...

380
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,791
"She's not my mom!

381
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,836
No sweat, I couldn't care less."

382
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,142
"La Calle de las Sirenas" is on the radio.
Just imagine.

383
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,813
You're 16, drunk for the first time

384
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,439
and "La Calle de las Sirenas"?

385
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,275
It plays tricks on your mind. I'm there...

386
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,777
being scolded,

387
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,279
"I can't believe it! How could you?"

388
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,280
And I'm there...

389
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,911
<i>Mermaids</i>

390
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,288
<i>In the moon</i>

391
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,751
"Yes, ma'am."

392
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,340
<i>Soaking</i>

393
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,634
<i>Stars</i>

394
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,178
<i>With paint</i>

395
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,059
<i>A thousand princesses dance by</i>
<i>With dresses...</i>

396
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,979
It was hard, so hard to be there.

397
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,195
Then, I see Vomitrón
is having a hard time.

398
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,157
He's really stiff, so strange.

399
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,457
Weird, kind of like jelly,
his head wouldn't move but his body would.

400
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,461
It was his gravity center.
There he was, focusing.

401
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,379
For when she turned the wheel,
it would be...

402
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,386
Speed bump.

403
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,637
Nothing, focused.

404
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,559
All of a sudden, his head starts moving.

405
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,106
There, like a pressure cooker regulator.

406
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,403
The beans are ready!

407
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,074
And he wants to open the window.

408
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,704
But it was a really old Cutlass, remember?

409
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,624
The thing wouldn't come down.

410
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,627
Eight turns per centimeter.

411
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,968
And then, it would go up... so weird.

412
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:18,433
And halfway open,

413
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:21,603
in comes one of the most impressive barfs

414
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,981
I've seen in my entire drunkard career.

415
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,151
This thing that only sounded...

416
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,778
and that's it.

417
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,533
That's it.

418
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,077
Like when you drop a one-gallon soda.

419
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,415
There was no...

420
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,333
No.

421
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,294
There was no...

422
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,379
No.

423
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,423
There was no "Grab my hair, man," nothing.

424
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:03,979
I swear, I hear that sound and...

425
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,231
"Did we hit a dove? What the hell?

426
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,651
Don't kill the wildlife, damn it!

427
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,112
Mankind is so selfish!"

428
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,781
So I turn around
and the whole windshield...

429
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,409
smeared with it.

430
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,744
On the inside.

431
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,706
And the outside.

432
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,834
A scientific marvel!

433
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,170
The vomit hit the windshield...

434
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,714
went out...

435
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,883
and outside it said, "This is cool,"
and came back in.

436
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,929
All purple there.

437
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,515
With white chunks.

438
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,561
Yes, you know, Vomitrón wanted Pingüinos.

439
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,566
There's your Picasso, sir.

440
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,778
Which his mother didn't take well,
obviously.

441
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:56,406
"This is..."

442
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,116
"Come on, Mom, chill..."

443
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,535
So she has to pull over.

444
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,830
And that's when extreme stupidity started.

445
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,333
We went crazy. I tried to convince her,

446
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,044
"No, Mrs. Vomitrón, the thing is...

447
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,006
We got to Gordo's party,

448
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,549
and you know Gordo...

449
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,885
I mean, it was lame, so we got there,

450
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,096
and it was so boring, we yawned.

451
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,058
And when we yawned, they stuffed
our mouths with alcohol. That's right."

452
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,772
The woman goes ballistic.
She won't stop screaming.

453
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,649
And that's when Vomitrón...

454
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:32,984
in an act of faith...

455
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,487
in an act of love...

456
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,739
straight from the heart,

457
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,450
wanting to reattach his umbilical cord...

458
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,121
which by then
was fractured by the situation...

459
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,249
takes off his T-shirt...

460
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,586
and starts cleaning the windshield.

461
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:54,964
Yes, yes.

462
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,007
The inside.

463
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,594
And a little outside, not much.

464
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,595
There he was.

465
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,722
With his fake Aéropostale T-shirt...

466
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:05,892
which made his mom even angrier.

467
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,186
For who washed Vomitrón's T-shirts?

468
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,275
The woman can't take it anymore.
She steps out of the car.

469
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,986
She's yelling, with hurtful words now.

470
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,698
"You know? That's why I divorced your dad!

471
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,949
This is what he'd do!

472
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,660
You're just like him!
I'm divorcing you! I hate you!"

473
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,956
She's trying to find someone to vent
her rage on, turns around, and her son...

474
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,668
She sees Miguel, fast asleep,
and then she sees me.

475
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,714
So she grabs me by the shirt...

476
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,133
and tells me, "Alejandro!

477
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,593
What are you thinking?

478
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,722
What the fuck are you thinking?"

479
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,391
And I'm, "Ma'am, what am I thinking?

480
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,186
I'm 16, I don't think.

481
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,149
But if you want an answer,
do you know what I'm thinking?

482
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,025
In this ugly Cutlass,

483
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,861
with your son puking, you yelling at me,

484
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,946
this fucker asleep,
do you know what I'm thinking?

485
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:05,827
<i>A thousand princesses dance by</i>
<i>With dresses that fly by"</i>

486
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,762
Are there any gamers with us tonight?
I love video games.

487
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:24,804
Where are you?

488
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,473
That's where the virgins are.

489
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,100
All of you think...

490
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,103
"Don't call us virgins, it's not right.

491
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,021
That's not true.

492
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,065
We're not virgins.
We just don't fuck much. Stop it!"

493
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,361
Besides, video games
aren't just for virgins anymore.

494
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,698
People who play them are very violent.
We're crazy.

495
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,951
Have you ever seen two friends play FIFA?
It's madness.

496
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,287
FIFA, the soccer video game.

497
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,748
Two friends,
they lose control just like that.

498
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,959
"Hey, pal.

499
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,547
Want to hang out in your bedroom...

500
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,636
and play some FIFA? Do you?"

501
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,596
What's his reply?

502
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,431
"I'll screw you, let's do it!

503
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,311
I'll fuck you up good.

504
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,022
What I want is to penetrate..." Wait...

505
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,152
"Aren't you buying me dinner first?"
"I'll shove my dick...!"

506
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,113
It's terrible.

507
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,949
Besides, the game is violent.

508
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:27,951
The game causes more violence.

509
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,577
When someone scores,

510
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:30,995
they play it back.

511
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,458
And only the one who scored
can make it stop playing back.

512
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,838
It's a Hitler thing. It's crazy.

513
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,842
It's very humiliating
when the other guy scores.

514
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,552
"Goal!"

515
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,720
If only you had the chance to say,
"I'll stop it, fuck!

516
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,765
I know how to make it stop playing back."

517
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,395
"Goal!"

518
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,437
"Stop it, moron!"

519
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,231
"Goal!"

520
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,400
Your friend won't let it go,

521
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,777
it's a moment of glory.

522
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,239
He'll make fun of you.
You're sitting there and he's enjoying it.

523
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:10,451
"Goal!

524
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:14,956
Goal!

525
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,875
Who's the man?

526
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,502
Goal!

527
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,761
I brought you a present.

528
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,892
Your birth certificate.
I'm your daddy! Goal!"

529
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,103
Horrible, just horrible.

530
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,780
"I'll screw you." What is that?

531
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,491
I know what it means, but what is that?

532
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,871
We don't listen to the words we say.

533
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,915
Imagine it was true...

534
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,335
That your FIFA match
ended that way, cool.

535
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,086
Right?

536
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,296
Oh, right.

537
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:16,851
Right? "Okay, cool, just relax.

538
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,771
It's just a game.

539
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,858
Don't overreact. Hi, ma'am.

540
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,780
No, we're playing FIFA.
Yes, just chilling.

541
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:31,866
Bread and cheese would be great, yes.

542
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,953
No sauce for him...

543
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,164
Yes, ma'am."

544
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,376
"Come on, man, stop crying.

545
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,462
Besides, it's your fault.

546
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,549
It's your fault, man.
You have no coordination

547
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,804
since you fell from the first floor
because they took the ladder away."

548
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,949
We live in a world of opinions.

549
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,575
Everyone has an opinion now.

550
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,704
When I said I was the best comedian
in the world, I know what you thought.

551
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,874
Right? We have an opinion.
It's fine, we all have an opinion.

552
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,460
I think it's too much.

553
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,965
Maybe you don't know, but porn sites
have a comments section now.

554
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,091
There...

555
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,135
on the porn site,

556
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,595
there's a comments section.

557
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,514
And people leave comments.

558
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,893
Should I respect the opinion of someone
with his jeans down to his ankles?

559
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,648
It's kind of weird, "No, I don't agree."

560
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,404
What's wrong with us?
People comment now.

561
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,740
You have your porn
and it has its comments section.

562
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:56,325
"The lady lacked passion."

563
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,705
Excuse me, Guillermo del Toro...

564
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:04,333
if you didn't like this masterpiece.

565
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,377
"I didn't like the end."

566
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,549
"I didn't like the end."
I read it, right there.

567
00:34:12,925 --> 00:34:14,135
Besides, we all know

568
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:16,304
all porn movies end the same way.

569
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,264
They all end the same.

570
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,308
They all end in your tears of sadness.

571
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,726
They all end there...

572
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,771
with you crying.

573
00:34:26,313 --> 00:34:27,398
"I didn't like the end."

574
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,858
It got me thinking.

575
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,110
For, yes, it would be great

576
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,197
if the porn movie
had a more artistic ending.

577
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,032
It would be lovely if you did your thing,

578
00:34:36,114 --> 00:34:37,699
watching the end of your movie,

579
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:39,994
with the last scene
with a big screen ending.

580
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,996
It would be lovely if you were there,
watching porn, the guy's there...

581
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,583
There he is, right?

582
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:49,170
The girl there...

583
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,899
"I see dead people."

584
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:11,067
It would be so great.

585
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,529
It's one way of seeing it.

586
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,955
But when I say everyone has an opinion

587
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,331
and I couldn't care less,

588
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,250
it has a lot to do
with the way I was raised.

589
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,752
I guess I'm bulletproof
against all opinions

590
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,671
because I was born
in a fucking huge family.

591
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,506
I'm the sixth out of six siblings.

592
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,425
Out of six, the last one! The youngest!

593
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:41,139
Everyone always tried to educate me.
I was raised with everyone's opinion.

594
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,640
When I was little, I once said,

595
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,724
"Dad!

596
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,603
I want to be an actor."

597
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,858
And my dad, straight from the heart,

598
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:56,028
empathically said, motivating his son,
he told me what a loving father would say,

599
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,906
"Oh, okay, you're going to be gay, then!

600
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,161
Why can't you be an engineer
like your brother,

601
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:06,914
or an engineer like your brother,
or an engineer like your brother?"

602
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,710
"I'm a psychologist."
"Shut up, we're covering engineers now!"

603
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,300
Parenthesis, we're six.

604
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,927
That means my parents had sex six times.
Yuck!

605
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,263
At least six times.

606
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,060
At least six times my dad told my mom,
"Come, baby." Six times!

607
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,524
I grew up with all these opinions,
but let me tell you...

608
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,444
If you ever have a dream
or want to do something with your life,

609
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,613
want to change something you're doing,

610
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,199
always have someone to support you,
no matter what.

611
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,201
Luckily, among my siblings,

612
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,912
I always had one who gave me his support.

613
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,289
It's rare, you don't just find someone

614
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,166
to support you unconditionally in life.

615
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,126
I think it has something to do...

616
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,961
And it sounds strange, don't frown,

617
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:56,714
but it may be
because he was born with a disability.

618
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,258
Some laugh back there, fucking great.

619
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,887
"He said 'disabled,' let's laugh.

620
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,432
That's a funny word."

621
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,813
It may sound strange, but my brother Pedro
was born with a disability.

622
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,315
He has cerebral palsy.

623
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:18,569
So he is disabled,
both mentally and physically.

624
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,572
Let's say he always had
the intelligence of a 12-year-old.

625
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,033
If you think about it, when he was seven,
he was a genius.

626
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,243
But that's not the point.

627
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,125
Let's not digress.

628
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:39,006
The point is the fucker
always had everyone's love.

629
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,759
He was always cheered on. "You want
to be an actor? Of course you do."

630
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,261
Nothing but love, always.

631
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,512
Just listen to this...

632
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,638
We went to the movies.

633
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,557
I took him to watch <i>Suicide Squad,</i>
and he liked it. That's how much...

634
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,521
unconditional love we're talking about.

635
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,525
He's someone who always supported me.
You should have someone like that.

636
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,569
I've always said comedy
is like a gigantic staircase

637
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:01,779
with a lot of steps.

638
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:05,449
You have to climb them little by little,
and you need a support system.

639
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:08,202
A very important step
is your first special.

640
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:11,580
I don't know if you've watched it,
but I had a special a few years ago,

641
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,790
on Netflix.

642
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,667
It was there, maybe you watched it.

643
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,502
Yes, some of you did. Great.

644
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,839
Yes, I don't blame you, it wasn't much.

645
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,882
We're getting better. So...

646
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,137
I remember the day
the special was released so well.

647
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,556
It was a truly special day.

648
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,099
I was in Hermosillo

649
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,350
finishing a tour.

650
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,227
I did a tour no one went to.

651
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,270
A tour...

652
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,105
no one went to.

653
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,982
Thirty-five people, I think.

654
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,067
I mean, in total,
if you add up all the cities.

655
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,321
Thirty-five people.

656
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:46,407
The Hermosillo show ends,
it was great, so I go to the hotel,

657
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,826
for there's not much to do
in Hermosillo and...

658
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,662
That night, I got a call

659
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,789
that changed my life forever.

660
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,541
My sister called

661
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,209
and told me, "Hey, I know...

662
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,296
that your special is coming out today,
and that it's very important,

663
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,048
but I have some news for you.

664
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,008
Pedro, our brother,

665
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,926
was just told he has esophageal cancer."

666
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,597
And...

667
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,807
I know what you're thinking now.

668
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,435
You're thinking,
"Oh, now he's going to get dramatic."

669
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,564
Yes, it is going to get dramatic.

670
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,567
Welcome, you paid your ticket for cancer.

671
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,818
We're here, there you go.

672
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,946
Welcome to Cancerland. Let's talk...

673
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,701
It's weird, because they tell me this news

674
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,037
and the first thing you think about
with cancer is why.

675
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,206
"Why?" is the first question you ask.

676
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,374
"Why my brother,

677
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:39,251
who didn't lie, didn't do drugs,
didn't drink, who always gave love?

678
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,837
Why him and not Donald Trump?"
Just a thought here, I don't know.

679
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,925
And there's no answer to that, guys.

680
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,761
And it's strange I'm here
talking about cancer,

681
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,930
but I think we have to talk about cancer,

682
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,681
it's a very common disease.

683
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,142
But for some reason,
no one speaks about cancer.

684
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,146
It's a whispered sickness.

685
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,608
Let's see. Obesity,
hypertension, diabetes,

686
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,151
top cause of death in the nation.

687
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:08,114
And I've never seen diabetes
being taboo, "Hey...

688
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,950
my dear Luis, what can I say?

689
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,036
Well...

690
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,082
If you ever need anything...

691
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,086
except for food, whatever you want,
we're here for you."

692
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,296
It just doesn't happen.

693
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,090
It doesn't happen with Luis.

694
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,512
I'm not saying it isn't
a horrible disease, it is.

695
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,932
But we've learned to live with it,
and we never speak about cancer.

696
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,976
Raise your hand here,

697
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,519
don't be shy, if you're...

698
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,440
a cancer patient
or know anyone who has had cancer.

699
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,900
Raise your hand
and keep it raised to see...

700
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:46,652
Leave it up there, don't put it down.

701
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,780
The rest of you who didn't raise
your hand, look around you

702
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,365
and take a look at the sheer numbers.

703
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,325
Cancer exists.

704
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,327
Thanks. But we don't talk about it.

705
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,830
It's a really ugly process

706
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:01,500
where I realized that your family
either comes together or it splits up.

707
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:03,669
Fortunately, mine came together.

708
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,880
And really together. I think it did...

709
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,132
Yes, it really bonded.

710
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,260
Four WhatsApp groups.

711
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,722
The same family, four WhatsApp groups.

712
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,976
See your horrible family group,
the hell you live on your cell phone?

713
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,436
Multiply it by four, that was me.

714
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,731
So tight. There was a group
with everyone in it.

715
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,232
The siblings, our parents,

716
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,442
uncles, dogs...

717
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,651
everyone.

718
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,361
Such a motivational group.

719
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,281
"Yes, of course, we'll fight it,
it'll be all right.

720
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:34,325
'Cancer' with 'C' for 'courage,'
bring it on!"

721
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,367
There they were.

722
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,415
Then, there was a group with less people

723
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,834
who'd say,
"Hey, we're not doing that great.

724
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,214
Don't tell the dogs. We're hanging
in there, just don't tell the dogs."

725
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,926
Then there was the small group,
where you had to pay.

726
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,636
People kept dropping out.

727
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:56,722
"So or so has left the group."

728
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:00,643
And in the end, one where I'd send memes
to myself and stuff like that,

729
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,063
just for motivation. There I was.

730
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,942
Dealing with such a tight family is weird.

731
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,486
Ironically, it was
in such an adverse situation

732
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:12,571
when my family was the tightest.

733
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,615
It's strange, really weird.

734
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,451
Blood donations were needed
for my brother's operation.

735
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,329
I don't know if you know
about esophageal cancer surgery. It's...

736
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,914
so extreme.

737
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,166
They take the esophagus
together with the tumor.

738
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,211
Then they make a new esophagus
with your stomach.

739
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,171
It's now possible.

740
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:34,176
You can tell the doctor,
"I want a hand here, please.

741
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:38,264
Just look at me fucking using it!"

742
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,310
And for this operation,
blood donations were needed.

743
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,646
So one of my brothers posts on the group,

744
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,399
"I'm not donating, I have blue blood."

745
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:54,071
I mean... sorry.

746
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,031
But I read that

747
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,534
as the family comedian...

748
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,540
and it sounds like an insult.

749
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,834
"Fuck, you're an engineer!

750
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,796
Stick to engineering, don't fuck with me!"

751
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,300
I was so mad I thought,

752
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,719
"No, I must have the last word.

753
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,554
The punch line is mine."

754
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,597
So I write,

755
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,057
"I'm not donating
because I have syphilis."

756
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,603
I didn't give a damn.

757
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,071
I didn't realize I'd sent it to the group
with kids in it.

758
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,450
They asked,

759
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,243
"What's syphilis, uncle?"

760
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,830
"Don't worry, cousin, I'm investigating.
Here's some images."

761
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:45,789
And we got them.

762
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,212
Donating blood is so hard. It really is.

763
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,673
It's easier to get your visa.

764
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,635
At least there's hope you'll get one.

765
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,261
They give you a questionnaire

766
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,640
with a bunch of questions.
It starts really friendly.

767
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,017
The blood questionnaire is like,
"Yes, bring it on.

768
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:09,480
Yes, all blood types are welcome. Do it!"

769
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:12,232
And little by little, it starts meddling.

770
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,777
First question, "Are you all right today?"

771
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,449
"Well, yes." Right?

772
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,702
"Yes, there's this cancer thing, but...

773
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:26,997
With a 'C' for 'courage'. Yes, yes."

774
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:30,876
Next question,

775
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:32,503
"Do you have a cold?

776
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,506
Is your nose runny? Do you feel...?"

777
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,466
"No, we're feeling great."

778
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,511
"Does your belly ache,
your stomach, your intestines?"

779
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,595
"No, no."

780
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,682
Next question, "Are you homosexual?"

781
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,645
"Man! Why are you screaming
at me, questionnaire?"

782
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,399
I mean, no,

783
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,733
but what if I was?

784
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,653
If you're gay, you have <i>frappuccino</i>
instead of blood or what?

785
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:00,906
"No.

786
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,575
And I'm not feeling so well anymore.
Half a point here.

787
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:09,248
I'll be fair with this questionnaire.
There we go."

788
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:13,001
Next question... And I swear
it had this question.

789
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,796
"Have you used bloody sexual toys?"

790
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,341
What is that?

791
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,137
I mean, I know what it is,
but what is that?

792
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,515
It sounds like a senator party.

793
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,103
How does the bloody sexual toy work?

794
00:45:31,186 --> 00:45:33,689
You go to the sex shop, buy your dildo,
drop it in blood...

795
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,568
and say, "I don't care,
I'll use it anyway."

796
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:41,029
"No."

797
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:45,409
Next question,
"Have you been raped recently?"

798
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,289
Never mind "raped"...

799
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,167
"recently"?

800
00:45:57,379 --> 00:46:00,591
This questionnaire has no memory.
Just as Mexico, it really forgets.

801
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,886
It's bad.

802
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,391
"Recently"!

803
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:12,895
The worst part is I read it,
"Have you been raped recently?"

804
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,605
And I go, "Yes...

805
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,233
I played FIFA and lost the other day!
You know what happens."

806
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,070
Anyway...

807
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,201
I didn't donate blood,
but I won't tell you why.

808
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,828
Yes, don't be nosy.

809
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,292
So, I went to my brother's hospital room.
And I think...

810
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:39,004
that was one of the most critical moments
in the entire process.

811
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,466
The second they took him to surgery.

812
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,469
It's heavy. It's hard to see someone

813
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,679
you love so much being taken to surgery

814
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,973
with 50% chance of living,

815
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,600
50% of dying,

816
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,144
zero percent didn't answer.
Just picture that.

817
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:56,939
It's raw data. So...

818
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,691
They're taking my brother,

819
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,777
and we each reacted in our own way.

820
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,987
This is another lesson I learned,

821
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,114
we each react to cancer in our own way.

822
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,784
If you want, you tell jokes.
You can cry if you want.

823
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:12,287
And it's fine, it's beyond our control.

824
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,331
That's why I also talk about it here.

825
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,292
Comedy helps us cope
with things we don't understand.

826
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:19,795
So, they take my brother,

827
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,756
and then, someone starts crying,
others start talking...

828
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,592
Me? I didn't understand what was going on.

829
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,678
I had to go and lean on a wall.

830
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,638
I was out of breath.

831
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,181
And I swear,

832
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,810
the importance of your family
coming together is right there and then,

833
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:37,479
for I'm going through
the worst moment of my life,

834
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:41,108
and suddenly, my 12-year-old niece
spots me from across the room,

835
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,317
walks to me,

836
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:44,319
and gives me...

837
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,072
the strongest hug
anyone has ever given me.

838
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,032
The most loving hug
anyone has ever given me,

839
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,159
the most heartfelt hug
anyone has ever given me,

840
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:52,744
and says, "Uncle...

841
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:54,788
don't worry,

842
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:57,082
I'm sure your syphilis will go away."

843
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,335
Brilliant.

844
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,479
Kids.

845
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,316
I'd love...

846
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,401
to tell you this story ends well.

847
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:27,154
But unfortunately,
after a year and a half

848
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,282
with esophageal cancer
that turned our lives around,

849
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,742
mine and my family's,

850
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:34,286
my brother Pedro passed away.

851
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,831
After 10 chemotherapies,
40 radiotherapies,

852
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,208
after having surgery,

853
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,669
which he recovered from like a champ.

854
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,630
And at no point,

855
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,259
at no point along that year and a half,
throughout the entire treatment,

856
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,761
did he stop giving us love,

857
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:53,972
did he stop loving us,
did he ever stop giving us his support.

858
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,766
Just so you know the size

859
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,434
of that dude's heart,

860
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,979
we were about three-quarters
along the treatment,

861
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,440
he loses a lot of weight, gets pneumonia,

862
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,150
so we have to hospitalize him.

863
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:08,070
So I stay with him that night
at the hospital.

864
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,321
And...

865
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,449
as the nurse washed him and dressed him,

866
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,285
they were chatting.
Pedro was a chatterbox.

867
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,495
And...

868
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,121
He tells the nurse,

869
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,915
"Hey, do you know Alex Fernández?"

870
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,043
The nurse says,
"Who the hell is that loser?"

871
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,755
I don't blame her.

872
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:29,967
And...

00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,718
My brother tells her,

874
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,930
"You don't know who he is?
He's the guy outside the door.

875
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,181
He's a comedian.

876
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:39,059
In fact, he's the best comedian
in the world."

877
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,938
And...

878
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,690
So if Pedro says so...

879
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,566
I believe it.

880
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:47,693
Thank you very much.

881
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:48,777
Good night.

884
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,100
Fuck cancer! Good night!

885
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,761

THE BEST BROTHER IN THE WORLD
