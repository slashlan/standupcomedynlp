[crowd cheering]

[cheering continues]

6
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:40,401
Thank you. Thank you.

7
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:49,951
Thank you, San Francisco.
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:50,994 --> 00:00:52,162
So good to be here.

9
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:54,540
People were surprised

10
00:00:54,623 --> 00:00:57,793
when I told 'em I was gonna
tape my special in San Francisco.

11
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:59,294
Said, "Why would you do that?

12
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:02,631
That's the most politically
correct city in the world."

13
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:04,675
[cheering and laughing]

14
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:07,969
Not when I'm on stage, it's not.

15
00:01:08,053 --> 00:01:09,430
[laughter]

16
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,769
I love this place.
One of my favorite cities to perform in.

17
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,020
It's a good place to hang out.

18
00:01:17,104 --> 00:01:19,356
Got to walk around a little bit today.

19
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,316
Saw a baby.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,859
[laughter]

21
00:01:27,698 --> 00:01:30,909
Saw a baby locked
inside the back of a hot car.

22
00:01:30,992 --> 00:01:32,620
[laughter]

23
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,872
So it's been a great day.

24
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:39,084
Love that.

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,878
Don't get me wrong. I'm not a monster.

26
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,005
I tried to help the baby.

27
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:47,968
- Tried to throw a rock through the window.
- [laughter]

28
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:51,221
- Window was down.
- [laughter]

29
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:58,395
- Ruined that baby's whole weekend.
- [laughter]

30
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,440
- It was worth it.
- [laughter]

31
00:02:01,982 --> 00:02:03,651
I love San Francisco.

32
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:05,110
[cheers and hoots]

33
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:09,323
One of my favorite things is
how beautiful all the women are here.

34
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:12,451
Yeah. Women in San Francisco
are gorgeous.

35
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:16,705
I say that despite what's...
going on in this crowd tonight.

36
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,290
[laughter]

37
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,591
But you guys live here.

38
00:02:28,717 --> 00:02:30,719
You guys live here. You've seen 'em.

39
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,680
[laughter]

40
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,518
I was in a bar last night,
saw this beautiful woman.

41
00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:39,770
Like a supermodel.

42
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:42,147
I walked up, I was like,
"Hey, where you from?

43
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,357
What do you do?"

44
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,276
She goes, "Oh, me?
I live here in San Francisco.

45
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,653
I'm a brain surgeon."

46
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:52,908
I don't know if this makes me sexist,
but I was really impressed.

47
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:55,118
- You know? I mean...
- [laughter]

48
00:02:55,202 --> 00:02:58,580
Most women... can't pull off sarcasm.

49
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:00,749
[laughter]

50
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:09,049
This is gonna be a good show.

51
00:03:09,132 --> 00:03:11,677
[laughter, cheering]

52
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:21,395
See, that joke, that joke is a test.

53
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:23,188
[laughter]

54
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:25,440
To see if you guys are cool or not.

55
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:29,403
That thing about the baby in the car,
that's just me clearing my throat.

56
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:30,946
[laughter]

57
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,825
That joke's the test.
If you guys laugh at that joke,

58
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:36,410
whole show goes great.

59
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:40,121
You don't laugh at that joke,
whole show goes bad.

60
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,792
And I've had shows go very, very bad.

61
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,045
Doesn't matter to me at all.

62
00:03:47,128 --> 00:03:48,547
[laughter]

63
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:57,723
Now, this next joke,
this next joke is a test

64
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:00,100
to see how cool you are.

65
00:04:00,183 --> 00:04:01,602
[audience chuckling]

66
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:03,437
I, uh...

67
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:05,856
I used to have a son.

68
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,315
[laughter]

69
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,072
Already some of you see
where this is going, that's good.

70
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:15,908
- [laughter]
- That's good.

71
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:19,327
I used to have a little
two-year-old son, but he died.

72
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,331
The same way Eric Clapton's son died.

73
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,250
[crowd groaning, chortling]

74
00:04:27,127 --> 00:04:28,295
For inspiration.

75
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,671
[laughter]

76
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:42,851
[cheers and applause]

77
00:04:48,983 --> 00:04:51,944
I'm not gonna lie, this is the best
that joke has ever done.

78
00:04:52,027 --> 00:04:54,029
[laughter]

79
00:04:54,112 --> 00:04:55,322
[woman cheers]

80
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,324
You guys kinda laughed,

81
00:04:57,407 --> 00:05:00,118
then started talking to each other
for some reason.

82
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:01,912
[laughter]

83
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:04,623
Then started clapping, that is amazing.

84
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,459
Most people just boo me.

85
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:09,044
[laughter]

86
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:14,633
But if you didn't understand
the joke... don't worry.

87
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:18,470
It's a complicated joke,
a lot of things you gotta know.

88
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:20,180
That joke is like an onion.

89
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,517
You've gotta know who Eric Clapton is.

90
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:26,020
Not a given these days.

91
00:05:27,855 --> 00:05:29,773
You've gotta know about his kid.

92
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:33,777
You gotta know how clumsy
that little lad was.

93
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:36,363
[roaring laughter]

94
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:50,460
You gotta know about that
terrible fucking song.

95
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:52,128
[laughter]

96
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,217
And then you gotta think all that's funny.

97
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,844
[laughter]

98
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:01,847
[woman laughing hysterically]

99
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:09,145
Now, I gotta get to know
you guys a little bit.

100
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:13,901
- [woman continues cackling]
- Starting with you for sure.

101
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:19,239
[cheers and applause]

102
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:23,368
I can tell you're a big comedy fan
and bat-shit insane.

103
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:24,452
[laughter]

104
00:06:27,497 --> 00:06:31,001
Did you just come
from the fucking dentist or what?

105
00:06:32,002 --> 00:06:33,587
What is your name?

106
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,047
- Peggy Jo.
- Peggy.

107
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:37,841
Peggy, what do you try to do?

108
00:06:37,925 --> 00:06:39,551
[laughter]

109
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:43,430
Not a lot, I'm disabled.

110
00:06:43,513 --> 00:06:45,766
You're disabled?
I know you're disabled.

111
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,607
Is this your husband with you?
Okay.

112
00:06:53,815 --> 00:06:56,610
Sir, what do you do,
so I can move the fuck on.

113
00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,655
- I'm an electrician.
- You're an electrician?

114
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:04,993
Great. That's an honorable job.
That's a good job to have.

115
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:08,329
I'm sure you shock the shit out of her
on a daily basis.

116
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:10,373
[laughter and applause]

117
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,295
Electrician.

118
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,465
It's a wonderful job.

119
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:23,595
There's a lot of bad jobs out there,
I'll tell you that right now.

120
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,139
Lot of bad jobs.

121
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,349
Hell, my Uncle John
runs a summer camp for...

122
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:30,560
kids about to get molested.

123
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,479
[laughter]

124
00:07:43,115 --> 00:07:44,240
I know, right?

125
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:47,661
I know, it sounds awful.

126
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:51,748
Sounds awful,
but he loves it. He's like...

127
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:53,750
[laughter]

128
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:59,047
Says he's never worked
a day in his life.

129
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:00,757
[laughter]

130
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:06,054
Doesn't pay much, but the benefits...

131
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:07,848
[laughter]

132
00:08:09,933 --> 00:08:11,309
[Peggy cackling]

133
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:13,020
[crowd laughs]

134
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:19,317
Do you guys have any kids? How many?

135
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,903
I have one, and he has two.

136
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,198
Okay.

137
00:08:24,364 --> 00:08:27,034
You guys ever done that thing
where you go online

138
00:08:27,242 --> 00:08:30,328
and see how many
sex offenders live around you?

139
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,832
Isn't it crazy?
Isn't it way more than you'd think?

140
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:37,377
You think it might be like one or two.
No, it's like chicken pox.

141
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,753
[laughter]

142
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,049
I went online, 15 child molesters.

143
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:47,179
Fifteen child molesters
within five miles of my apartment.

144
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:51,558
So, why do we always
have to meet at my place?

145
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:53,768
[laughter]

146
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:02,652
And if you're wondering,
"Anthony, this is great,

147
00:09:02,736 --> 00:09:06,740
but are all of these jokes
gonna be about hurting children?"

148
00:09:06,823 --> 00:09:08,408
I don't know, probably.

149
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:10,077
[laughter]

150
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:14,748
Seems like something I would do.

151
00:09:14,831 --> 00:09:16,041
[laughter]

152
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,212
I of course live in Los Angeles.

153
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:22,756
I've got a nice place.

154
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:23,965
Obviously.

155
00:09:26,176 --> 00:09:29,512
My brother's been staying with me,
which has been awful.

156
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:33,058
My brother is crazy.
Even my neighbors hate him.

157
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,271
The other day I opened the door,
I caught him masturbating.

158
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:40,732
He looks me right in the eyes and goes,
"Shut the door."

159
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:42,567
[laughter]

160
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:44,861
I said, "Get inside."

161
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:46,280
[laughter]

162
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:59,459
My family loves it
when I put them in jokes. They love it.

163
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:02,420
"Anthony, please,
put me in your next joke."

164
00:10:02,503 --> 00:10:05,882
"Are you sure? I'm gonna
make you a pedophile."

165
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:08,384
[laughter]

166
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:12,931
"We don't care. We wanna be part
of this thing you've got going on."

167
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:17,727
So I wrote that joke, put my brother in.
I'm in Chicago, where he lives.

168
00:10:17,811 --> 00:10:20,563
After the show, he comes backstage
and I say, "Mikey,

169
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:24,234
what'd you think about that new joke?
Did you like the shout out?"

170
00:10:24,318 --> 00:10:25,735
[laughter]

171
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,822
And he gets all uncomfortable.

172
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:32,200
He goes, "Well, crowd seemed
to think it was funny...

173
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,746
but I think it's kinda weird
that you got a joke

174
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,373
where you wanna fuck me."

175
00:10:38,456 --> 00:10:40,250
[laughter]

176
00:10:44,712 --> 00:10:49,217
And I said, "What, Mikey? No!
No, Mikey. You're my brother.

177
00:10:49,301 --> 00:10:52,804
That's a joke about you
masturbating in front of my house."

178
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:58,559
And he goes, "Yeah, and then
you're like, 'Get back inside.'"

179
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:09,196
Just in case you guys are wondering
whether my brother's a fuckin' idiot.

180
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,655
[laughter]

181
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,872
Yeah, I've got a nice place.

182
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,874
Try to keep it nice.

183
00:11:20,957 --> 00:11:22,334
Not always successful.

184
00:11:23,084 --> 00:11:24,878
Like, I tried getting a puppy.

185
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:26,880
Disaster.

186
00:11:27,088 --> 00:11:29,132
Had to get rid of that puppy.

187
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:32,010
Had to get rid of that puppy
almost immediately.

188
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:34,846
The first time I left it home alone,
the first time

189
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,723
I left that puppy home alone,

190
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:40,101
that damn thing
tore my entire place apart,

191
00:11:40,185 --> 00:11:41,811
shit everywhere,

192
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:43,855
and starved to death.

193
00:11:43,938 --> 00:11:45,106
[laughter]

194
00:11:53,156 --> 00:11:54,949
Why are you mad?

195
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:57,244
I'm the one who couldn't
get his money back.

196
00:11:57,327 --> 00:11:58,578
[laughter]

197
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:04,167
And this is traditionally where
crowds really start to turn on me.

198
00:12:04,251 --> 00:12:05,335
[laughter]

199
00:12:06,253 --> 00:12:08,422
After I kill a puppy with neglect.

200
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:09,964
[laughter]

201
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:12,592
And it's okay.

202
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,930
It's okay, you can get mad at me.
You can hate me.

203
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:21,309
You can hate me and still laugh at me.
That's how talented I am.

204
00:12:21,393 --> 00:12:22,560
[laughter]

205
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,730
And I'm used to it. I'm used to it.

206
00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:30,360
I once dated a girl who punched me
in the face as hard as she could.

207
00:12:30,444 --> 00:12:34,781
Once dated a girl, punched me right
in the face as hard as she could.

208
00:12:34,864 --> 00:12:38,326
I didn't do anything about it.
I didn't say anything about it.

209
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,995
I just turned around and left the room.

210
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,917
But in my head, in my head,
all I was thinking was... [chuckles]

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,502
"Now we're even."

212
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,301
She was so mad.

213
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,637
She got mad at me.

214
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,307
She got mad at me
'cause I killed all of her plants.

215
00:13:01,057 --> 00:13:03,101
Killed every single one
of her house plants.

216
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:04,519
And she had told me.

217
00:13:04,602 --> 00:13:08,398
She said, "Anthony,
I'm going out of town for two weeks.

218
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:12,235
Give each one of these half a cup
of water every other day."

219
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,361
But I'm a dude.

220
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:17,949
All I heard was "two weeks"
and "cheat on me."

221
00:13:18,032 --> 00:13:19,075
[laughter]

222
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,544
Like my neighbors in L.A...

223
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:35,300
My neighbors in L.A. have got this
smokin' hot 18-year-old daughter.

224
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:37,051
I mean, she's perfect.

225
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:42,015
But she just got a tattoo
of a butterfly over her chest.

226
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:43,224
Which is horrible.

227
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:47,728
Doesn't she understand how dumb
that's gonna look some day,

228
00:13:47,812 --> 00:13:50,982
all stretched out over my lamp?

229
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,442
[laughter]

230
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,659
Yeah, that's a joke.

231
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:03,453
[chatter, giggling]

232
00:14:04,538 --> 00:14:06,873
That's a joke where I'm a serial killer.

233
00:14:06,956 --> 00:14:08,291
[laughter]

234
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:10,877
I'm very open about it.

235
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,131
Don't you dare tighten up on me.

236
00:14:15,215 --> 00:14:16,632
[laughter]

237
00:14:16,716 --> 00:14:18,718
I hate sensitivity.

238
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:19,802
I hate it.

239
00:14:20,595 --> 00:14:23,723
Even when little kids get sensitive,
that makes me mad.

240
00:14:24,307 --> 00:14:26,017
I got a six-year-old nephew.

241
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:30,146
I asked what he wants for
his birthday. He said, "Uncle Anthony,

242
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,065
I want you to get me a Barbie doll."

243
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,275
I said, "Fuck you."

244
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,152
[laughter]

245
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:39,531
"You six-year-old piece of shit."

246
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,241
[laughter continues]

247
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,035
And don't get me wrong.

248
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:46,746
Don't get me wrong,
I don't care if he plays with dolls.

249
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,915
He can wear dresses if he wants to.

250
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:51,292
But I'm not getting him a Barbie doll.

251
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:55,796
You see, Barbie dolls give little boys
unrealistic expectations...

252
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,425
[cheers and applause]

253
00:15:02,303 --> 00:15:05,473
...of how easy it's gonna be
to tear off a head.

254
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,275
I won't do it.

255
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:23,032
I get really mad when people
get sensitive about comedy.

256
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,744
If you're sensitive about comedy,
it's the dumbest thing you can do.

257
00:15:26,827 --> 00:15:28,455
I call them the joke police.

258
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,374
They always have one rule,
one rule they have.

259
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,751
You can't make fun of this right now.

260
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,129
After a couple years,
they move on to something else,

261
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:39,549
which is why it's so hypocritical.
Like the thing today,

262
00:15:39,633 --> 00:15:41,759
the thing right now
you can't make fun of,

263
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:44,304
the thing that's too sensitive
at this moment?

264
00:15:44,387 --> 00:15:46,264
Trans-gendered people.

265
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,891
See?

266
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:50,602
[laughter]

267
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:53,271
You can't do it.

268
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:55,649
Can't make fun of them.

269
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:56,774
It's too sensitive.

270
00:15:56,857 --> 00:16:00,987
In fact, you can't even call them
"chicks with dicks" anymore.

271
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,116
No. No.

272
00:16:05,325 --> 00:16:08,620
You have to call them
"men who talk too much."

273
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,746
[laughter]

274
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:13,791
[cheers and applause]

275
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:21,174
Right?

276
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,721
But I hear this all the time.

277
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:30,725
People'll be like,
"Anthony, that was really funny.

278
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:34,145
But, man, women must hate you.

279
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,359
Women must come to your shows
and hate the shit out of you."

280
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:42,612
And I always say, "No. No.

281
00:16:42,696 --> 00:16:44,614
Stupid women hate my shows."

282
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:46,324
[laughter]

283
00:16:46,907 --> 00:16:48,951
"Stupid women hate my shows.

284
00:16:49,035 --> 00:16:52,664
Smart women... don't come to my shows."

285
00:16:59,003 --> 00:17:01,506
Speaking of which, what's your name?

286
00:17:02,882 --> 00:17:04,718
- What? Kim.
- [woman] Kim.

287
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,720
- Kim, where you from?
- San Jose.

288
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:08,638
San Jose? Okay.

289
00:17:08,722 --> 00:17:10,598
What do you do, Kim?

290
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:12,600
Um, I'm a branch manager.

291
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:15,436
- Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut?
- No, for...

292
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,439
What? What the fuck?
Where'd you go to school?

293
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:21,067
- UC Santa Cruz.
- What'd you study?

294
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,403
- Economics.
- Economics? Okay.

295
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:26,030
You ever gonna use that someday?

296
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:30,159
I had to go to Catholic school
when I was a kid.

297
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:32,286
Hated Catholic school.

298
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,456
Hated Catholic school more than anything.

299
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:37,375
The nuns were vicious.

300
00:17:38,084 --> 00:17:41,379
They would hit me with a ruler,
slap me in the face.

301
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:44,924
Anything to defend themselves.

302
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:47,009
[laughter]

303
00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:51,514
You guys loved
the shit out of that one, huh?

304
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:54,392
- [laughter]
- Hated school.

305
00:17:54,475 --> 00:17:59,480
When I was in the fifth grade,
one of my classmates got cancer.

306
00:18:00,774 --> 00:18:02,275
Came down with the cancer.

307
00:18:02,358 --> 00:18:03,693
[audience chuckles]

308
00:18:03,777 --> 00:18:04,778
Which was sad.

309
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:08,656
But the story is actually cool
and inspiring.

310
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,702
Every single guy...
Every single guy in the school, we all...

311
00:18:12,786 --> 00:18:15,413
shaved our heads to make fun of him.

312
00:18:15,496 --> 00:18:17,707
[laughter]

313
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:18,958
Yeah.

314
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:20,752
No, it was great.

315
00:18:21,502 --> 00:18:23,463
It was great, we did it for like a month.

316
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:27,592
We would have kept doin' it, but you know.

317
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:33,139
You know how cancer gets.

318
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:39,979
You guys ever... You guys ever
trace back your family history?

319
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:42,482
Go back a couple generations
in your family tree,

320
00:18:42,565 --> 00:18:45,943
find out embarrassing shit
you wish you didn't know?

321
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:50,114
I traced my family tree back,
found that I actually had family

322
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:53,409
fighting on both sides in World War II.

323
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,328
Humiliating.

324
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:01,375
The piece-of-shit side of my family fought
for the Nazi infantry in Germany,

325
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:05,463
while the bad-ass Jeselniks
were here in America

326
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:08,132
- spying for the Germans.
- [laughter]

327
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,641
I assume everyone is drinking tonight?

328
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,643
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

329
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:19,686
[man] Whoo!

330
00:19:19,853 --> 00:19:22,188
That's good. I love to drink.

331
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:25,941
Love it. Do it all the time,
every day, always have.

332
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:27,193
[crowd chuckles]

333
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:29,863
I don't know where it comes from either.

334
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:31,614
Even my parents tell me,

335
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:34,074
when I was just a little baby,

336
00:19:34,158 --> 00:19:36,870
I used to climb out of
my crib every morning,

337
00:19:36,952 --> 00:19:39,539
and then crawl over
to the liquor cabinet...

338
00:19:40,414 --> 00:19:42,166
to try to spend time with them.

339
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,501
[laughter]

340
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:49,924
I like San Francisco, so liberal.

341
00:19:52,719 --> 00:19:56,972
So liberal. Clap your hands here.
Clap your hands if you own a gun.

342
00:19:57,891 --> 00:19:59,266
[mixed clapping]

343
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:04,271
- San Jose is in the house, huh?
- [laughter]

344
00:20:10,361 --> 00:20:11,487
Not too bad.

345
00:20:13,113 --> 00:20:15,950
I once asked the crowd
in Houston that question.

346
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:17,410
[laughter]

347
00:20:17,493 --> 00:20:21,247
- They just started firing guns in the air.
- [laughter continues]

348
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:25,334
- Didn't even let me finish the question.
- [laughter]

349
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,964
I don't own a gun.
I'm against guns, to be honest.

350
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:31,048
[people hooting]

351
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:35,219
When I was a kid...
When I was a kid, my parents had a gun.

352
00:20:35,302 --> 00:20:37,304
My parents said we had to have a gun.

353
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:40,307
Gotta have a gun to protect
the five children.

354
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:43,811
Gotta have a gun
to protect our five children.

355
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,480
Of course, they eventually
got rid of it...

356
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:49,024
to protect their four children.

357
00:20:49,108 --> 00:20:50,735
[laughter]

358
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,619
I'm not gonna lie,
it was fun while it lasted.

359
00:20:59,702 --> 00:21:01,370
[laughter]

360
00:21:02,622 --> 00:21:04,624
I was getting pretty good towards the end.

361
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,083
[laughter continues]

362
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:09,921
Man, my parents were strict.

363
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:13,340
Mom and dad were strict.

364
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:17,219
My mom and dad once made me smoke
an entire pack of cigarettes.

365
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:20,431
An entire pack of cigarettes
in one sitting.

366
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:24,685
Just to teach me an important lesson
about brand loyalty.

367
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:26,270
[laughter]

368
00:21:30,107 --> 00:21:32,526
I learned a lot from my parents.

369
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,361
Especially my dad.

370
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:35,989
Like, I'll never forget...

371
00:21:36,823 --> 00:21:39,951
the first time I ever got
a bad report card in school.

372
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:42,954
First time I got a bad report card,
I brought it home,

373
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:45,957
I gave it to my dad
and my dad beat me.

374
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:47,875
Beat the hell out of me.

375
00:21:48,501 --> 00:21:49,836
But I learned something.

376
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,464
Because the next time I got
a bad report card in school,

377
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:56,467
I brought it home
and I gave it to my mom.

378
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,760
[laughter]

379
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:00,513
Let her take the hit.

380
00:22:00,596 --> 00:22:02,056
[laughter]

381
00:22:09,856 --> 00:22:10,857
Yeah.

382
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:14,027
My dad was a hard-ass.

383
00:22:15,028 --> 00:22:18,781
One of those guys who believed that
men just learn by doing things.

384
00:22:18,865 --> 00:22:21,116
You know? You don't take classes.

385
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,952
You don't read the instructions.

386
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,746
You just do it and figure it out.

387
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,333
Like, when I was a kid,
I never got to take swimming lessons.

388
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,586
No, my dad would pick me up
and throw me in the water

389
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,964
to teach himself CPR.

390
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:43,973
As a kid, my dad's prized possession,

391
00:22:44,181 --> 00:22:46,433
my dad's favorite thing
in the world growing up?

392
00:22:46,517 --> 00:22:51,022
My dad was the proud owner
of a Mickey Mantle rookie card.

393
00:22:51,689 --> 00:22:55,192
Mickey Mantle rookie
baseball card, mint condition.

394
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:57,653
Kept it between two
little pieces of plastic.

395
00:22:58,696 --> 00:22:59,822
But I was a kid.

396
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:02,575
I didn't know any better.

397
00:23:02,783 --> 00:23:06,746
One day I took that card to school
and I traded it to a classmate

398
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:08,205
for a candy bar.

399
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,584
You know what that card is worth today?

400
00:23:12,877 --> 00:23:14,921
My relationship with my father.

401
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:16,881
[laughter]

402
00:23:23,554 --> 00:23:25,347
I mean it, my dad was no joke.

403
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:28,225
My dad did not fuck around.

404
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,395
My dad did not trust anybody.

405
00:23:31,604 --> 00:23:34,107
My dad did not trust anyone.

406
00:23:34,189 --> 00:23:36,442
In fact, he had a saying...

407
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:39,112
but he wouldn't tell me.

408
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:41,238
[laughter]

409
00:23:45,034 --> 00:23:47,912
What, too clever for you?
That joke is fuckin' amazing.

410
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:52,166
[people hooting]

411
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,670
Last year was a sad year for my family.

412
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:01,134
Last year, my mom should've been
celebrating her 60th birthday.

413
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:06,680
But because of drugs, alcohol
and other terrible decisions,

414
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:08,015
we all forgot.

415
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:10,267
[laughter]

416
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:16,983
It was sad.

417
00:24:19,068 --> 00:24:21,570
When I was a kid, I used to fantasize
about getting older,

418
00:24:21,654 --> 00:24:23,280
growing up and having money,

419
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,159
and buying my mom
nice things for her birthday.

420
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:28,119
When I was a kid, we were poor.

421
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:31,205
So poor I remember,
just so I could go to my senior prom,

422
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:34,083
just so I could go to my senior prom,

423
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:37,252
I had to sell my
U.S. passport on the street.

424
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:41,757
Sold my passport
on the street for 300 bucks

425
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,383
to get to go to my prom.

426
00:24:43,968 --> 00:24:47,096
Of course this was before 9/11 so...

427
00:24:47,638 --> 00:24:49,598
my bad, everybody.

428
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:51,558
[crowd groaning, chuckling]

429
00:24:52,685 --> 00:24:55,104
Weird joke to clap for, but sure.

430
00:24:56,689 --> 00:25:00,442
My mom should've been on one
of the planes that crashed on 9/11.

431
00:25:02,153 --> 00:25:03,487
I think.

432
00:25:09,118 --> 00:25:11,704
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I loved my mother.

433
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:16,125
She was my mom, of course
I loved her. We fought a lot.

434
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,127
My mom could be very racist.

435
00:25:18,211 --> 00:25:19,753
Very racist.

436
00:25:19,837 --> 00:25:21,672
And I do not tolerate racism.

437
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:24,299
That's ignorance and I hate that.

438
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,429
When I was a kid, like nine years old,
I'd come home after school.

439
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:33,475
Once in a while, I'd bring a friend
over to play with me at my house.

440
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:36,187
Once in a while,
I'd bring a black friend over.

441
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,898
And when I did that,
my mom would act weird.

442
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:43,236
She'd pull me aside and say,
"Anthony, who's your new friend?

443
00:25:43,944 --> 00:25:45,529
Is he a drug dealer?"

444
00:25:46,613 --> 00:25:49,491
And I would say,
"Shut up, Mom, that's racist.

445
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:50,868
Put your money away."

446
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,369
[laughter]

447
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:01,712
I never get to see
my family anymore, really.

448
00:26:01,795 --> 00:26:03,797
Most of them are in jail, to be honest.

449
00:26:04,715 --> 00:26:07,634
And we never talk, write letters
or any of that shit.

450
00:26:08,219 --> 00:26:11,138
'Cause they're all in jail
for the exact same thing.

451
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:13,682
My testimony.

452
00:26:25,485 --> 00:26:26,570
You.

453
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,363
[laughter]

454
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,117
- What's your name?
- Melissa.

455
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,368
- Melissa, where you from?
- Santa Clara.

456
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:36,496
- What do you do?
- I win things on the radio.

457
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,874
- You win things on the radio?
- Yeah.

458
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,961
Follow-up question,
how'd you get tickets to this?

459
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:46,506
Let me ask you this.

460
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,969
You ever, uh... you ever find a body
in the woods? Ever do that?

461
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:51,470
No?

462
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:54,181
It's okay. I have.

463
00:26:54,265 --> 00:26:56,016
[laughter]

464
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,560
I was walking
through the woods one day and...

465
00:26:58,644 --> 00:27:02,439
some poor bastard had stepped
in a bear trap or something.

466
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:05,359
I never told anybody about it.

467
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:08,821
But I went back there a week later,
and he was dead.

468
00:27:12,992 --> 00:27:14,201
Yeah.

469
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:18,622
I do crazy shit like that all the time.

470
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:19,999
[laughter]

471
00:27:20,082 --> 00:27:21,708
What can I say? I'm wacky.

472
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:25,171
The other night I was driving my car.

473
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:28,507
I was driving my car
and I ran over a deer...

474
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,510
a dear, dear friend.

475
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:42,521
I'm torn constantly. At night, I do shows,
but during the day, I've got a hobby.

476
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:45,107
During the day,
I go from town to town...

477
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:48,110
and I shut down the local abortion clinic.

478
00:27:50,321 --> 00:27:52,447
- You heard me.
- [laughter]

479
00:27:52,614 --> 00:27:55,826
I shut down abortion clinics
everywhere I go.

480
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:58,287
It's easy for me. I'm charming.

481
00:28:00,497 --> 00:28:03,959
I stand outside the front doors
all day long and...

482
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:06,212
consistently underbid them.

483
00:28:06,295 --> 00:28:09,089
[crowd groaning, laughing]

484
00:28:18,265 --> 00:28:20,017
You guys mad about that one?

485
00:28:22,602 --> 00:28:24,521
It's gonna get so much fuckin' worse.

486
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:30,444
Gotta talk to one more person.

487
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:33,155
You, sir. What's your name?

488
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:35,157
- Allan.
- Allan, where you from?

489
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:37,243
- Frisco.
- Frisco.

490
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,081
[people booing]

491
00:28:43,999 --> 00:28:46,668
I can tell you're a local
'cause of how cool you are.

492
00:28:46,752 --> 00:28:48,045
[laughter]

493
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:54,343
What do you do, Frisco?

494
00:28:54,427 --> 00:28:55,761
[laughter]

495
00:28:57,137 --> 00:28:59,890
- I fight fires. I fight fires.
- You what?

496
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:02,309
You're a firefighter? Awesome.

497
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,144
[cheers and applause]

498
00:29:08,899 --> 00:29:10,734
What do you wanna do?

499
00:29:10,817 --> 00:29:12,569
[laughter]

500
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:17,032
If you could do anything.

501
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,078
If you could do any job in the world,
what would your dream job be?

502
00:29:21,161 --> 00:29:23,247
- Travel the world.
- Travel the world.

503
00:29:23,497 --> 00:29:25,458
It's good to have a dream.
I hope you go for it.

504
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,127
It doesn't sound like
you're even gonna get close.

505
00:29:29,002 --> 00:29:31,713
I think you should do it.
Travel the world.

506
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:35,550
Do it. Everyone should try
to live their dream, that's my point.

507
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,010
Everyone.

508
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:39,012
I get to live my dream.

509
00:29:39,096 --> 00:29:42,349
I mean, not when I'm in San Francisco,
but for the most part.

510
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,310
[laughter]

511
00:29:44,393 --> 00:29:46,186
Being a comedian was my dream.

512
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:50,732
'Cause no one can tell me what to do.
That's all I cared about.

513
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:53,777
Most people don't ever
try to live their dream.

514
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:56,196
Lot of people try and they fail.

515
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,326
Which I think is better,
more noble, more respectable.

516
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:04,955
I had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about,
cared about, talked about...

517
00:30:05,164 --> 00:30:07,707
wanted to become an astronaut.

518
00:30:07,791 --> 00:30:09,668
Fly into space one day.

519
00:30:09,751 --> 00:30:10,961
And he went for it.

520
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:12,629
He went for it.

521
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,258
And he failed. He blew it.

522
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:20,762
- Ended up becoming one of those pussies...
- [crowd chuckles]

523
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:23,265
...on the Space Shuttle <i>Challenger.</i>

524
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:24,891
[groans, laughter]

525
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:29,188
You guys remember that, right?

526
00:30:32,525 --> 00:30:33,817
I think it's funny.

527
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:38,738
I think it's funny how the things
that happen to us when we're kids

528
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:41,450
end up staying with us
for our entire lives.

529
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:44,286
I got this little niece.

530
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:47,122
When she was three years old,
she almost drowned.

531
00:30:47,247 --> 00:30:50,209
And now to this day, even ten years later,

532
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:53,753
she still will not go anywhere near me.

533
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:56,298
[laughter]

534
00:31:02,888 --> 00:31:04,764
Yeah, I was babysitting her...

535
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:07,351
and trying to do laundry.

536
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:09,269
[laughter]

537
00:31:10,979 --> 00:31:13,899
And she accidentally
fell into the washing machine.

538
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:17,944
Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes.
I thought I got her out

539
00:31:18,028 --> 00:31:22,408
before anyone would find out
what happened, but nope.

540
00:31:22,491 --> 00:31:24,117
Turned everything pink.

541
00:31:24,201 --> 00:31:26,453
[groans, laughter]

542
00:31:34,711 --> 00:31:37,881
You're gonna find out a lot
about yourselves on this next one.

543
00:31:37,964 --> 00:31:39,883
[laughter]

544
00:31:44,721 --> 00:31:46,390
Hey, did you guys know...

545
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:48,016
[laughter]

546
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:51,937
Did you guys know
that when a newborn baby...

547
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:55,649
when a newborn baby is first born,

548
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:58,611
when it's fresh out of the womb...

549
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:02,072
it can actually hear and see
everything around it...

550
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:06,368
for up to ten seconds
after it's decapitated?

551
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:07,953
[groans and laughter]

552
00:32:13,083 --> 00:32:14,084
Yeah.

553
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:17,879
Yeah.

554
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:20,591
I never know what to say.

555
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:26,430
I never know what to say to someone
after they've lost a baby.

556
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:29,558
What do you say to someone
after they've lost a baby?

557
00:32:29,642 --> 00:32:31,393
"Oh, I'm sorry for your loss"?

558
00:32:31,477 --> 00:32:32,478
Doesn't cut it.

559
00:32:32,686 --> 00:32:35,397
"Are you gonna be okay?" Not even close.

560
00:32:35,481 --> 00:32:38,317
That's why I just keep my mouth shut.

561
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,235
Let my lawyer do the talking.

562
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:42,321
[laughter]

563
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:50,579
I'm not good with kids. That's my point.

564
00:32:50,663 --> 00:32:52,122
[laughter]

565
00:32:53,206 --> 00:32:56,669
That's what this whole thing's about.
I'm not good with kids. Not gonna lie.

566
00:32:56,751 --> 00:32:58,211
[crowd chuckles]

567
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:01,715
Hell, a couple of months ago,
I dropped my cousin's baby.

568
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:04,926
Flat-out dropped
my cousin's baby on the ground.

569
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:08,096
But I don't feel like that was my fault.

570
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,266
I don't feel responsible
for that one, you know?

571
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,393
Who in their right mind...

572
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:16,730
who the hell in their right mind
would ever ask me,

573
00:33:16,813 --> 00:33:18,732
Anthony Jeselnik,

574
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:20,526
to be a pallbearer?

575
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:22,819
[groans and chuckling]

576
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,699
It's okay, people hate...

577
00:33:27,574 --> 00:33:29,284
people hate dead baby jokes.

578
00:33:30,827 --> 00:33:31,995
They hate them.

579
00:33:32,954 --> 00:33:34,080
They hate them.

580
00:33:34,748 --> 00:33:37,834
It's like, "Anthony, why do you have
to tell dead baby jokes?

581
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,003
Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?"

582
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,421
[laughter]

583
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:45,967
"No one likes them, why do you insist?"

584
00:33:46,051 --> 00:33:48,178
Well, I'll tell you why.

585
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:51,139
Because dead baby jokes have made me rich.

586
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:52,641
[laughter]

587
00:33:58,564 --> 00:33:59,690
And who was it?

588
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,569
Who was it who said
the first million is the hardest?

589
00:34:04,486 --> 00:34:05,696
Was it Hitler?

590
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:07,906
[groans and laughter]

591
00:34:14,913 --> 00:34:17,082
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

592
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:18,542
[laughter]

593
00:34:21,086 --> 00:34:22,546
That was a good response.

594
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:23,672
[crowd chuckles]

595
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:26,466
Most audiences
just pretend I didn't say it.

596
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,927
- [laughter]
- [mutters indistinctly]

597
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:32,514
But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes.

598
00:34:33,432 --> 00:34:34,725
It's cool for me.

599
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:38,144
I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather.

600
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:41,481
I lost my grandfather
in the Holocaust Museum.

601
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:43,983
[laughter]

602
00:34:47,279 --> 00:34:49,823
It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art.

603
00:34:53,285 --> 00:34:56,622
Which is just like
a normal Holocaust museum,

604
00:34:56,705 --> 00:34:59,708
except you walk around all day
being like, "Oh!

605
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,835
I should have thought of that."

606
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:12,471
My grandmother died about a year ago.

607
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:16,266
And I didn't think
anything could ever be worse

608
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:18,769
than when my grandmother passed away.

609
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:20,687
But I was wrong.

610
00:35:20,771 --> 00:35:22,063
It was fine.

611
00:35:22,147 --> 00:35:23,982
[crowd chuckling]

612
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,657
The hard part, the upsetting part...

613
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:36,995
was that we thought she died
in the way that she wanted.

614
00:35:37,078 --> 00:35:40,165
She wanted to die
in the best way possible, like uh...

615
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:43,752
You, radio winner.
What's the best way you can die?

616
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,755
This is not a trick question.

617
00:35:47,964 --> 00:35:50,676
- In your sleep?
- Yes, thank you.

618
00:35:50,884 --> 00:35:54,929
Thank you, everybody wants
to die peacefully in their sleep.

619
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:56,807
Not me.

620
00:35:57,015 --> 00:36:00,727
I want to be alert, awake,
surrounded by friends,

621
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:01,978
in a house fire.

622
00:36:06,608 --> 00:36:09,319
But my grandmother
wanted to go peacefully in her sleep.

623
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:13,281
We thought that's how she went.
We were all excited for her.

624
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:16,201
But then we did an autopsy.

625
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:21,206
Found out she actually died horribly,
in the worst way possible.

626
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:24,584
During an autopsy.

627
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:26,252
[groans and laughter]

628
00:36:27,337 --> 00:36:28,588
It was fucked up.

629
00:36:29,172 --> 00:36:30,465
Yeah.

630
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:31,925
Yeah.

631
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:37,472
She always said her grandkids
didn't pay enough attention to her and...

632
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:39,516
and she was right.

633
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,059
She was dead on.

634
00:36:43,019 --> 00:36:46,690
But I loved my grandma.
Loved her very much.

635
00:36:46,773 --> 00:36:49,025
My grandma taught me about a lot.

636
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:50,777
Taught me what religion is.

637
00:36:50,985 --> 00:36:53,864
Taught me everything
you can know about religion,

638
00:36:53,947 --> 00:36:56,324
in one quick story. I'll tell you now.

639
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:59,536
When I graduated from high school...

640
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:03,081
When I graduated, my grandma came to me,
gave me a big hug,

641
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:05,792
said, "Anthony, I'm so proud of you.

642
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:08,420
You're my first grandchild
to get to go to college.

643
00:37:08,503 --> 00:37:12,549
What can I do for you, what can I give you
before you go to college?"

644
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:16,302
And I said, "Honestly, Grandma,
all I need from you is money."

645
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:17,303
[crowd chuckles]

646
00:37:17,387 --> 00:37:21,975
Yeah, I know you guys have never been,
but college is expensive.

647
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:23,894
[laughter]

648
00:37:25,186 --> 00:37:28,022
And my grandma said,
"Okay, Anthony, I understand."

649
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:31,192
Couple months go by.
It's the end of summer.

650
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:34,988
I'm packing up my dad's car,
getting ready to go to school,

651
00:37:35,071 --> 00:37:36,698
and my grandma walks up.

652
00:37:36,782 --> 00:37:39,910
Says, "Anthony, here,
before you leave, take this."

653
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:43,789
And she handed me a brand-new Bible.

654
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:45,958
King James Version.

655
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,962
And I said, "Thanks, Grandma,
that's exactly what we talked about."

656
00:37:50,044 --> 00:37:52,798
[laughter]

657
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:58,762
I got in the car and I went off to school.

658
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:00,847
Couple of weeks go by,

659
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:05,727
I'm hanging out in my dorm room,
having a good time, when the phone rings.

660
00:38:05,811 --> 00:38:07,020
It's my grandma.

661
00:38:07,938 --> 00:38:10,649
"Anthony, just calling
to see how college is going."

662
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:13,986
"Grandma, college is the best.
I'm having the time of my life.

663
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:17,656
But to be honest, I'm starting
to run low on money,

664
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:20,408
and I could use a little bit,
like we talked about."

665
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:23,912
She said, "Okay, well let me ask you this:

666
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:26,581
Have you been reading your Bible?"

667
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:30,627
And I said, "Totally, Grandma,
I'm on chapter four."

668
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,921
[crowd chuckles]

669
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:39,511
She said, "Okay, Anthony,
I guess I'll talk to you later."

670
00:38:39,594 --> 00:38:40,679
Hung up the phone.

671
00:38:41,554 --> 00:38:45,600
Couple of months go by. Now I'm really
starting to struggle financially.

672
00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:50,730
Might have to drop out of school,
so I call my grandma in a panic.

673
00:38:50,814 --> 00:38:54,901
I say, "Please, it's Anthony.
I'm having the time of my life in college.

674
00:38:54,985 --> 00:38:57,029
But if I wanna graduate, and I do,

675
00:38:57,111 --> 00:39:01,199
I need you to send me some money
like we talked about."

676
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:06,412
She said, "Anthony, let me ask you this:
Have you been reading your Bible?"

677
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,624
And I said, "Yes, Grandma!
I wish it was longer!"

678
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,710
[laughter]

679
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,842
And she said, "Okay, Anthony.
I guess I'll talk to you later."

680
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:22,261
Finally, it's the end of the school year.

681
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:25,223
I've got straight A's,
but I'm dropping out of college,

682
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,141
'cause I have no more money left.

683
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:31,396
And I'm furious, close to tears,
cleaning out my dorm room,

684
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:34,148
when the phone rings. It's my grandma.

685
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:39,029
"Anthony, I heard you're dropping out
of school today. How come?"

686
00:39:39,112 --> 00:39:42,365
And I said, "You know
goddamn well how come, Grandma!

687
00:39:44,242 --> 00:39:47,037
'Cause you wouldn't give me any money."

688
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,875
She said, "Anthony, let me ask you this:
Did you read your Bible?"

689
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:55,045
And I just hung up the phone.
I was so pissed off.

690
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,213
Took everything out of that room.

691
00:39:57,296 --> 00:40:00,967
Last thing I took off the shelf,
the last thing I took out of that room,

692
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:03,344
was that Bible my grandma had given me.

693
00:40:03,553 --> 00:40:07,348
Took it off the shelf,
held it in my hands,

694
00:40:07,432 --> 00:40:10,268
and for the first time,
I actually opened it up.

695
00:40:11,227 --> 00:40:16,232
And on the very first page,
in my grandmother's handwriting,

696
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:17,859
it said, "Fuck you."

697
00:40:17,943 --> 00:40:21,905
[laughter, cheering]

698
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,080
Thank you everyone.

699
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:33,708
I hope you enjoyed the jokes
I prepared for you tonight.

700
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:36,377
[cheers and applause]

701
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,678
And all the jokes I write,
they're all made up, they're all fake,

702
00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:47,806
except for Eric Clapton
and the <i>Challenger.</i>

703
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:51,893
Everything else...
everything else is fake.

704
00:40:52,644 --> 00:40:54,520
But everything I'm about to tell you,

705
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:57,398
from here until the end of the show,
that's all true.

706
00:40:58,191 --> 00:40:59,317
Now...

707
00:41:00,485 --> 00:41:03,321
I don't tell dark jokes
because I'm a comedian.

708
00:41:03,404 --> 00:41:06,158
I'm a comedian because I tell dark jokes.

709
00:41:07,117 --> 00:41:09,202
I'm kind of fucked up, all right?

710
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:12,747
I've always been this way.
I can't really help myself.

711
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:15,625
It gets me into trouble a lot.
I lose friends.

712
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,670
It's ruined relationships
with people in my family.

713
00:41:18,753 --> 00:41:22,215
For instance, my grandmother
actually did pass away,

714
00:41:22,298 --> 00:41:23,842
about six months ago.

715
00:41:23,925 --> 00:41:27,220
I did love her very much.
She was a big fan of mine.

716
00:41:27,303 --> 00:41:30,098
And I was asked to speak at her funeral,

717
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:32,017
which was a horrible mistake.

718
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,186
[laughter]

719
00:41:34,268 --> 00:41:36,021
Horrible mistake.

720
00:41:36,104 --> 00:41:39,357
No one should ever ask me
to speak at anyone's funeral.

721
00:41:40,066 --> 00:41:41,400
I asked a friend for advice.

722
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:43,903
Was like, "I've never
talked to a group of people

723
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:47,573
without getting paid a lot of money.
How should I handle this?"

724
00:41:47,657 --> 00:41:50,368
"Anthony, just go up there
and tell a story.

725
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,331
Find one moment about you and your grandma
you can share with everybody.

726
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:57,959
And don't tell a joke. Try not to."

727
00:41:58,043 --> 00:42:01,796
So I walked up and was like,
"You know what my favorite memory was?

728
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,716
When I was like four years old,
before I learned to read,

729
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,010
Grandma would curl up with me
on the couch,

730
00:42:07,093 --> 00:42:09,804
she had this Southern accent,
and she would read to me.

731
00:42:09,888 --> 00:42:13,307
She would read Mark Twain to me,
and I loved it. Like...

732
00:42:13,391 --> 00:42:16,978
Mark Twain out of my grandma's mouth,
it would just come to life."

733
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:19,522
And then I couldn't help myself.

734
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:22,608
I said,
"And I know my grandma loved it too,

735
00:42:22,692 --> 00:42:25,778
because it combined
her two favorite things:

736
00:42:25,862 --> 00:42:29,991
spending time with her grandchildren,
and using the 'N' word."

737
00:42:30,158 --> 00:42:31,910
[laughter, applause]

738
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,872
[crowd cheering]

739
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:46,883
Now I promise you... I promise you...

740
00:42:47,092 --> 00:42:50,428
until you've heard your grandfather gasp

741
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:52,555
at his own wife's funeral...

742
00:42:52,638 --> 00:42:54,724
[laughter]

743
00:42:54,807 --> 00:42:57,852
...at a Methodist Church
in Vicksburg, Mississippi...

744
00:42:59,395 --> 00:43:01,314
you are not a real comedian.

745
00:43:01,397 --> 00:43:03,066
[laughter]

746
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:06,194
I am a real comedian.

747
00:43:06,278 --> 00:43:08,071
I am a pure comedian.

748
00:43:08,863 --> 00:43:11,449
I think I'm one of the best
comedians of all time.

749
00:43:11,532 --> 00:43:14,035
[cheering]

750
00:43:16,996 --> 00:43:18,998
But here's the thing.

751
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:21,626
It doesn't matter if you believe me.

752
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:23,502
It really doesn't matter.

753
00:43:23,586 --> 00:43:27,257
The important thing is that
I would pass a lie detector test.

754
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,092
[laughter]

755
00:43:31,427 --> 00:43:33,763
I like to test myself.

756
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:38,684
I like to test myself by joking
about horrible things and nothing but.

757
00:43:38,768 --> 00:43:41,187
One of my favorite ways to test myself,

758
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:44,857
I like to joke about tragedies
the day that they happen.

759
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:47,360
The day they happen.

760
00:43:47,443 --> 00:43:50,989
I don't believe in too soon.
I'm on a tight schedule.

761
00:43:51,072 --> 00:43:53,866
[laughter]

762
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:57,662
And I'm good at it. I'm good at it.

763
00:43:57,745 --> 00:43:59,831
Like, the day of...

764
00:43:59,914 --> 00:44:03,793
the day of the Aurora, Colorado
Batman movie theater shooting.

765
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:05,253
[crowd groans]

766
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:08,881
The day it happened,
I went online, I went on Twitter,

767
00:44:08,965 --> 00:44:12,426
and I tweeted "Other than that,
how was the movie?"

768
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:15,721
[laughter]

769
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:16,722
Right?

770
00:44:18,683 --> 00:44:20,185
Right? Nailed it.

771
00:44:21,811 --> 00:44:23,229
Nailed it.

772
00:44:25,606 --> 00:44:28,360
And the reason I get away with that...

773
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:32,613
the reason I get away with stuff like that
is I'm just the guy who does it.

774
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:36,659
People are used to it from me.
It would be weird if I didn't make a joke

775
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,203
the day of a tragedy.

776
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:41,080
Which is why I was very surprised

777
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:45,377
when I got in a lot of trouble
the day of the Boston Marathon.

778
00:44:45,459 --> 00:44:47,379
[crowd groans, chuckles]

779
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:50,173
Now, I don't follow the news regularly.

780
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,759
But I know the second a tragedy happens

781
00:44:53,843 --> 00:44:58,139
because I get 25 text messages
saying, "Don't do it."

782
00:44:58,223 --> 00:45:00,183
[laughter]

783
00:45:07,857 --> 00:45:12,486
And whenever I see that...
whenever I see that, it makes me sad.

784
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:15,448
It makes me sad 'cause I know
something horrible has happened.

785
00:45:15,531 --> 00:45:18,243
People will say, "Anthony,
what's funny about Aurora?

786
00:45:18,326 --> 00:45:20,453
What's funny about the Boston Marathon?

787
00:45:20,536 --> 00:45:22,621
What's funny about
your grandmother's funeral?"

788
00:45:22,705 --> 00:45:23,915
Nothing!

789
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:26,418
Nothing is funny about those things.

790
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:28,627
That's where I come in.

791
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:30,422
[laughter]

792
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:35,634
So I see these texts and I'm like,
"Oh, no, what happened?"

793
00:45:35,718 --> 00:45:37,845
But I also think, "I've got a job to do."

794
00:45:37,929 --> 00:45:40,056
[crowd chuckles]

795
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:42,434
So I go online, I start reading about it.

796
00:45:42,516 --> 00:45:45,644
I don't want to watch the footage.
But I'll read about what happened.

797
00:45:45,853 --> 00:45:48,940
And I think, "How can I make
someone laugh today?"

798
00:45:50,816 --> 00:45:52,444
And then I think, "I got it."

799
00:45:53,527 --> 00:45:55,196
I go back on Twitter.

800
00:45:55,863 --> 00:46:00,952
And I tweet, "Guys, today, there are just
some lines that should not be crossed."

801
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,787
[laughter, clapping]

802
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,628
[clapping continues]

803
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:14,924
- "Especially the finish line."
- [laughter]

804
00:46:15,007 --> 00:46:19,304
And again, I think,
"Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"

805
00:46:19,387 --> 00:46:21,764
[chuckles and hoots]

806
00:46:23,557 --> 00:46:25,310
But then my phone starts to ring.

807
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:27,520
And it's my boss.

808
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:30,564
Or should I say my former boss.

809
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:32,691
[laughter]

810
00:46:33,485 --> 00:46:36,279
And they say,
"Anthony, this is unacceptable.

811
00:46:36,362 --> 00:46:38,572
You are not just a comedian today.

812
00:46:38,656 --> 00:46:41,451
You're also the host of your own TV show,

813
00:46:41,534 --> 00:46:44,412
with your name in the title,
on our network.

814
00:46:44,496 --> 00:46:47,499
You take this joke down right now
or you're fired."

815
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:50,626
And I say, "Go fuck yourselves."

816
00:46:51,503 --> 00:46:53,379
[cheers and applause]

817
00:46:59,677 --> 00:47:03,722
And I meant it. I didn't
get into comedy for money or fame.

818
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:07,560
I know that sounds wrong,
because I'm dripping with both.

819
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:09,812
[laughter]

820
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:13,566
I only got into this business

821
00:47:13,649 --> 00:47:15,860
so that no one could tell me what to do.

822
00:47:15,943 --> 00:47:19,947
- [light applause]
- And they said... Sure.

823
00:47:20,823 --> 00:47:22,825
[crowd chuckles]

824
00:47:22,908 --> 00:47:25,828
They said, "Well, Anthony,
you don't understand.

825
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:28,747
You don't understand at all. If you don't
take this joke down right now,

826
00:47:28,831 --> 00:47:32,377
if you don't delete this joke right now,
not only are you fired,

827
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,505
but the entire cast and crew
of your television show,

828
00:47:35,588 --> 00:47:39,217
about a hundred people,
they're also out of a job."

829
00:47:39,884 --> 00:47:43,555
And I'm ashamed to tell you this.
I'm embarrassed to admit it.

830
00:47:43,637 --> 00:47:47,850
But in that moment, I folded,
and I deleted the joke.

831
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:51,270
'Cause I'm happy to fight
for what I believe in.

832
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:53,606
I'm happy to take the consequences
for what I've done.

833
00:47:53,689 --> 00:47:57,902
But what I could not do, cannot do,
is walk up to my cameraman

834
00:47:57,985 --> 00:48:00,863
and say, "Hey, buddy,
no work for you on Monday.

835
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:02,698
I had this sweet tweet."

836
00:48:02,781 --> 00:48:05,201
[laughter]

837
00:48:06,494 --> 00:48:08,120
Couldn't do it.

838
00:48:10,248 --> 00:48:13,834
But as soon as I hit delete,
I got mad and I regretted it.

839
00:48:13,918 --> 00:48:17,671
I would fire every single one of those
fucking assholes now, I'll tell ya that.

840
00:48:20,007 --> 00:48:23,844
And I got mad for betraying myself
and everything I believe in.

841
00:48:23,928 --> 00:48:26,847
I'm just as mad today as I was then.
Just as mad.

842
00:48:27,056 --> 00:48:29,683
So mad, I had to have a meeting
with the network,

843
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:32,645
where they called me in
for a little lecture.

844
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:34,939
They're like, "Anthony, we're family.

845
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:36,774
Why are you so upset?

846
00:48:36,857 --> 00:48:38,526
Can't you see we did you a favor?

847
00:48:38,734 --> 00:48:41,529
Don't you worry about your career?"

848
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:44,449
Let me ask you, San Francisco,

849
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:47,076
do I seem like I worry about my career?

850
00:48:47,243 --> 00:48:49,203
[crowd cheering]

851
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:53,874
No.

852
00:48:54,584 --> 00:48:58,921
You know why people who win the lottery
always end up going bankrupt?

853
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,507
Because if they're worried
about their money,

854
00:49:01,591 --> 00:49:04,802
they wouldn't have played the lottery
in the first fuckin' place.

855
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:06,887
[laughter, cheering]

856
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:10,057
I do not worry about my career.

857
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:13,018
And they said, "Anthony, the problem is

858
00:49:13,227 --> 00:49:16,730
when you make a joke on Twitter
the day of a tragedy,

859
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:19,942
it seems like you're
making fun of the victims,

860
00:49:20,025 --> 00:49:21,402
and that's wrong."

861
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:24,822
But that's not what I'm doing.

862
00:49:25,698 --> 00:49:28,493
Because, you see, the day of a tragedy,

863
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:31,621
victims are not on Twitter.

864
00:49:31,704 --> 00:49:33,164
[laughter]

865
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,710
Am I wrong?

866
00:49:37,793 --> 00:49:39,044
Tell me I'm wrong.

867
00:49:39,128 --> 00:49:40,338
[crowd chuckles]

868
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:44,300
The day of a tragedy,
victims have got victim shit to do.

869
00:49:44,383 --> 00:49:47,052
[laughter and hoots]

870
00:49:47,136 --> 00:49:48,012
No one is ever...

871
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:51,807
No one is ever putting on a tourniquet,
asking, "Hey, are we trending?"

872
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,851
- [laughter]
- No.

873
00:49:55,811 --> 00:49:57,896
This is who I'm making fun of

874
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,608
when I make a joke on Twitter
the day of a tragedy.

875
00:50:00,692 --> 00:50:03,861
The people who see
something horrible happen in the world

876
00:50:03,944 --> 00:50:05,988
and they run to the Internet.

877
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:10,201
And they run to their social media,
Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got.

878
00:50:10,284 --> 00:50:14,539
And they all write down
the exact same thing:

879
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:18,710
"My thoughts and prayers..."

880
00:50:18,792 --> 00:50:20,670
[crowd chuckles]

881
00:50:20,753 --> 00:50:23,756
"My thoughts and prayers
with the people in Aurora."

882
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,635
"My thoughts and prayers
with the families in Boston."

883
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:30,137
Do you know what that's worth?

884
00:50:30,221 --> 00:50:31,556
Fucking nothing.

885
00:50:31,639 --> 00:50:33,932
[hoots and applause]

886
00:50:34,016 --> 00:50:36,101
Fucking less than nothing.

887
00:50:36,185 --> 00:50:37,770
[applause continues]

888
00:50:38,437 --> 00:50:39,855
Less than nothing.

889
00:50:40,648 --> 00:50:44,026
You are not giving any of your time,
your money or even your compassion.

890
00:50:44,109 --> 00:50:47,279
All you are doing, all you are doing,

891
00:50:47,363 --> 00:50:50,866
is saying, "Don't forget about me today."

892
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:54,286
[crowd chuckling, cheering]

893
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:56,247
"Don't forget about me."

894
00:51:02,253 --> 00:51:06,674
"Lots of crazy distractions in the news,
but don't forget how sads I am."

895
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,634
[laughter]

896
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:13,472
Those people are worthless
and they deserve to be made fun of.

897
00:51:13,556 --> 00:51:17,476
They're like a wedding photographer
who only takes selfies.

898
00:51:17,643 --> 00:51:19,645
- You understand?
- [laughter]

899
00:51:22,648 --> 00:51:24,983
Now I'm sure everyone here

900
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:28,153
has told a joke before
where nobody laughed at it.

901
00:51:28,904 --> 00:51:32,450
It's fine. It's embarrassing,
but it's fun. You can laugh at yourself.

902
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:34,993
It's not a reason to stop telling jokes.

903
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:40,499
Maybe some of you have told a joke before
where someone got mad at you for it.

904
00:51:40,583 --> 00:51:42,918
Trust me, that's fun too.

905
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:44,670
[crowd chuckles]

906
00:51:45,463 --> 00:51:48,758
You guys ever tell a joke
and then get death threats?

907
00:51:50,635 --> 00:51:54,639
- Well, I guess that's what makes me me.
- [laughter]

908
00:51:55,681 --> 00:51:57,683
On my television show,

909
00:51:57,767 --> 00:52:01,854
I once did a segment
that aired once and only once,

910
00:52:01,937 --> 00:52:05,817
before it was banned,
called "Shark Party." All right?

911
00:52:05,899 --> 00:52:08,611
- [cheering]
- Now...

912
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:13,491
Some of you enjoyed it,
but if you've never seen "Shark Party,"

913
00:52:13,574 --> 00:52:16,285
you can never see "Shark Party."

914
00:52:16,494 --> 00:52:19,705
It's been wiped off the face of the earth
by the powers that be,

915
00:52:19,789 --> 00:52:21,666
so I will explain it to you.

916
00:52:22,333 --> 00:52:24,126
I love sharks.

917
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,337
I love sharks more than anything.

918
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,882
People... People I can
barely fucking tolerate.

919
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,509
[laughter]

920
00:52:31,592 --> 00:52:36,430
Every single year, 100 million sharks
are killed by human beings.

921
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:40,976
Every year, 20,
25 people killed by sharks?

922
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,647
So when I hear about a shark attack,
I'm like, "Fuck, yeah."

923
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,482
[laughter]

924
00:52:47,024 --> 00:52:48,776
Win one for the home team.

925
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:50,528
[laughter]

926
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,366
So as soon as I get this show
where I can do what I want,

927
00:52:55,449 --> 00:52:56,617
I say, "You know what?

928
00:52:57,743 --> 00:52:59,912
I want to have a shark party.

929
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:03,374
As soon as there's a shark attack,
we're having a shark party."

930
00:53:03,457 --> 00:53:05,710
And I get lucky.

931
00:53:06,168 --> 00:53:10,798
About a month into my run, this guy from
New Zealand gets eaten by a great white,

932
00:53:10,882 --> 00:53:12,925
the champagne of sharks.

933
00:53:13,008 --> 00:53:15,052
[laughter]

934
00:53:16,804 --> 00:53:20,349
And I know exactly what to do.
I've already got the script written.

935
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:22,894
I walk on stage,
in front of the cameras.

936
00:53:22,976 --> 00:53:24,812
I say, "Ladies and gentlemen,

937
00:53:24,896 --> 00:53:28,399
this guy from New Zealand
has been eaten by a great white shark.

938
00:53:28,482 --> 00:53:30,943
- It's time for a shark party."
- [crowd chuckles]

939
00:53:31,026 --> 00:53:34,572
Lights go down, music comes up.

940
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:38,450
Six women wearing shark dresses
come out on either side of me,

941
00:53:38,534 --> 00:53:40,285
and we all start dancing.

942
00:53:41,036 --> 00:53:42,621
For way too long.

943
00:53:42,705 --> 00:53:44,790
[laughter]

944
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:51,046
A stripper wearing a giant shark head
runs out and gives me a lap dance.

945
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:52,381
Very tasteful.

946
00:53:52,464 --> 00:53:54,383
[laughter]

947
00:53:55,426 --> 00:53:59,847
And then I stand up and we show
a giant picture of the guy who got eaten.

948
00:53:59,931 --> 00:54:02,600
Which, in retrospect,
is where it all went wrong.

949
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:04,017
[laughter]

950
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,819
But I get to say my favorite thing
I've ever said on television:

951
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:16,655
"Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party."

952
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:18,950
[laughter, cheering]

953
00:54:27,625 --> 00:54:32,588
And in America, where I'm famous
for those types of shenanigans...

954
00:54:33,631 --> 00:54:36,801
everybody was like,
"Anthony, that was fucked up."

955
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:38,135
[crowd chuckles]

956
00:54:38,218 --> 00:54:40,220
"It was fucked up to see you dance."

957
00:54:40,304 --> 00:54:43,265
- [laughter]
- End of controversy.

958
00:54:44,308 --> 00:54:48,771
However, in New Zealand,
where they don't get my show,

959
00:54:48,854 --> 00:54:52,566
they've never seen me,
and frankly, they don't get out much...

960
00:54:53,525 --> 00:54:56,528
the New Zealand media takes the video...

961
00:54:57,822 --> 00:55:00,491
and they show it to the guy's family.

962
00:55:00,574 --> 00:55:02,242
[crowd groaning]

963
00:55:02,326 --> 00:55:05,496
And they say,
"What do you guys think about this?"

964
00:55:05,579 --> 00:55:10,125
And they say, "Crikey," or whatever
the fuck they say over there.

965
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:12,085
[laughter]

966
00:55:14,254 --> 00:55:19,092
The point is, all of New Zealand,
all of New Zealand rises up against me.

967
00:55:19,176 --> 00:55:23,347
- All 45 of those cunts rise up.
- [laughter]

968
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:27,559
And start threatening my life.

969
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,606
Now, I don't read the things that people
write about me on the Internet.

970
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:35,275
But I pay people who do.

971
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:36,652
[crowd chuckles]

972
00:55:36,735 --> 00:55:38,737
And they come to me,
and they're like,

973
00:55:38,821 --> 00:55:41,406
"We've got some terrible news.
Please sit down."

974
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:45,243
They say, "You are getting
a lot of death threats online

975
00:55:45,327 --> 00:55:47,913
from New Zealand
because of 'Shark Party.'"

976
00:55:47,997 --> 00:55:51,500
And I was like, "Really?
New Zealand wants to kill me?

977
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:55,504
That's weird because
they didn't even kill the shark."

978
00:55:55,587 --> 00:55:58,423
[laughter]

979
00:56:00,926 --> 00:56:03,721
I said, "How many
death threats am I getting?"

980
00:56:03,804 --> 00:56:08,141
And they were like "Oh, all of them.
You are getting all of the death threats.

981
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:11,395
What do you want us to do?
We can send someone to talk to them.

982
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:13,146
Extra security? What do you want?"

983
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,192
I said, "No, forget about it.
Leave it alone, don't worry."

984
00:56:18,694 --> 00:56:22,489
This might be hard for some to understand.
I've said it several times tonight.

985
00:56:22,573 --> 00:56:24,449
Everyone is going to die.

986
00:56:25,283 --> 00:56:27,745
I know full well I am going to die.

987
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:32,624
And most of us don't get to choose
how we check out.

988
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:37,462
But if I die because someone murders me
over one of my jokes?

989
00:56:38,505 --> 00:56:41,216
- Best case scenario.
- [laughter, cheering]

990
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:50,768
If somebody murders me
over one of my jokes,

991
00:56:50,851 --> 00:56:54,105
- I immediately become a legend.
- [crowd chuckles]

992
00:56:54,187 --> 00:56:55,814
I'm a comedy God.

993
00:56:55,898 --> 00:56:59,484
The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me,
four times.

994
00:56:59,568 --> 00:57:01,236
[laughter]

995
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:04,115
I said, "Come on then."

996
00:57:04,782 --> 00:57:08,243
My security guys are like,
"Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know,

997
00:57:08,326 --> 00:57:10,328
that is the dumbest thing
we've ever heard."

998
00:57:10,412 --> 00:57:12,330
[laughter]

999
00:57:12,414 --> 00:57:14,499
"But you're the boss. Okay."

1000
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:15,793
And they leave.

1001
00:57:17,128 --> 00:57:18,963
And then the next day they come back.

1002
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:22,049
And they say "Anthony,
sorry to bother you again.

1003
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:25,343
I know you didn't care yesterday,
but it's gotten much worse.

1004
00:57:25,427 --> 00:57:26,804
You're gonna wanna hear this."

1005
00:57:27,972 --> 00:57:30,599
They say, "Someone
from New Zealand tracked down

1006
00:57:30,682 --> 00:57:34,812
your mom and dad's phone number
and address in Pittsburgh,

1007
00:57:34,895 --> 00:57:36,688
posted that online...

1008
00:57:37,481 --> 00:57:41,193
and now your entire family is getting
death threats from New Zealand."

1009
00:57:42,111 --> 00:57:45,697
And I have to admit,
that had never occurred to me before.

1010
00:57:46,448 --> 00:57:48,159
It never crossed my mind...

1011
00:57:48,993 --> 00:57:52,370
that my family, my loved ones,
would ever pay the price,

1012
00:57:52,454 --> 00:57:54,331
be caught in harm's way,

1013
00:57:54,414 --> 00:57:57,250
for something I've done
or I've joked about.

1014
00:57:57,334 --> 00:58:00,712
And honestly, I would
cut my throat for my jokes.

1015
00:58:00,796 --> 00:58:03,132
I would give my life for what I do.

1016
00:58:03,757 --> 00:58:05,092
But if anyone,

1017
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:09,387
and I mean this for a fact,
if anyone ever hurt my family

1018
00:58:09,471 --> 00:58:13,100
or killed someone I cared about
because of a joke I've made?

1019
00:58:13,184 --> 00:58:14,351
Even better.

1020
00:58:14,434 --> 00:58:17,562
[laughter, cheering]

1021
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:29,366
[cheering, applause]

1022
00:58:29,401 --> 00:58:34,401
