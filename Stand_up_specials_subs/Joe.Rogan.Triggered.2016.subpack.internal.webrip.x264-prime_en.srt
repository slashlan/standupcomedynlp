1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,878
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome Joe Rogan.

2
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,390
What the fuck is going on,
San Francisco?

3
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:02,229
Thanks for coming.
I appreciate it! God damn!

4
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,731
Put your phone down, fuckface!

5
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,066
I see you, bitch!
Put your phone down!

6
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,818
Motherfuckers.

7
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,737
They can't use their eyes.

8
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,698
Everybody's gotta live
through their goddamn phone.

9
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,701
Whoo! I'm high as fuck. Whoo.

10
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:16,910
It's strange.

11
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,247
I wasn't sure if I was gonna do
this sober. I'm like, "Ugh..."

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,498
It's not the move.

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,252
Not in San Francisco.
This is...

14
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:30,924
I love pot, but the people that are making
edibles need to slow the fuck down.

15
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,469
Oh, my God!
What are you trying to do to people?

16
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,556
I had a pot gummy bear the other day.

17
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:44,021
I think we can all agree a gummy bear
shouldn't be able to steal your soul.

18
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,272
Right?

19
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,610
How the fuck are these people
making these things, man?

20
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:51,945
They're not consistent.
That's also part of the problem.

21
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,155
You don't know what you're getting,

22
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,950
'cause they're not making them
the same place where they make Tylenol.

23
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:58,451
Nah, it's some greasy dude

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,538
with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on
and a gray ponytail.

25
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,624
He's got a bowl of ingredients,

26
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:06,459
and he can't remember
whether or not he put weed in yet.

27
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,921
This dude's time traveling,
just back and forth.

28
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,550
He just keeps chucking weed in there
until it looks like lawn trimmings.

29
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,971
You eat it,
and it's not what you're looking for.

30
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,558
It's not regulated.
You gotta ask questions.

31
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,894
I asked a dude at the pot store.

32
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,271
I go, "Hey, man, how strong
are the gummy bears?"

33
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,480
He goes...

34
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,860
That's not a unit of measurement.

35
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:34,697
He's like, "El diablo. El diablo."

36
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,911
"Fuck, man. How much should I take?"

37
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,245
"Just the leg."

38
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,833
"Just the leg?

39
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,085
Why are you selling whole bears?

40
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,337
What the fuck are you trying
to prove, man?"

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,925
They just watch you leave with that bear.

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,426
They go, "Oh, shit."

43
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,263
They know.
They know you're not gonna die.

44
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,100
You're gonna think you're gonna die,
but everybody lives.

45
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,103
Learn some shit.

46
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,021
We learn some shit from the scary trips.

47
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,694
See, the thing about edibles,
one of the problems with it being illegal,

48
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,823
is that a lot of us don't have a lot
of information that we could use.

49
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,283
Like, there's a difference
between smoking it and eating it.

50
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:22,119
When you smoke it, you get THC.

51
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,705
But when you eat it,
it's processed by your liver,

52
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,458
and it produces something
called 11-hydroxy metabolite

53
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,379
that's five times more psychoactive
than THC.

54
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,882
And it lets you talk to dolphins.

55
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,473
This is a real moment
that changed my life.

56
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,895
I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat,
and we were fishing.

57
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,063
We were pulling these lines
behind the boat,

58
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,899
and I was so high,

59
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,818
I was trying to figure out
which way the Earth was spinning.

60
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,657
Like, the boat's going this way,
and the sun's up there.

61
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,700
I'm like, "Um..."

62
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,581
For like 20 minutes, I'm paralyzed.

63
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,753
So, while this is all happening,
these dolphins just show up.

64
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:16,006
And if you've ever been around
wild dolphins, they're very trippy.

65
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,427
It's very different than you expect,
because they look at you.

66
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,804
They, like, check you out.

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,514
They, like, pop out of the water
and they, like, look at you...

68
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,436
like a person,
not like a fucking deer or woodchuck.

69
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,772
They look at you like another person.

70
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:34,942
Granted, I was so high
I thought I was gonna die, but...

71
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,195
I'm making eye contact
with these dolphins,

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,324
and I started thinking,
"How smart are these fucking things?"

73
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,786
Because we're fishing.
Dolphins eat fish.

74
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,662
But you never catch dolphins.

75
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,457
Ever.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,837
No one has ever gone fishing
and accidentally caught a dolphin.

77
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,672
And all I could think of
while these dolphins were, like,

78
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,008
hopping through the water,
and looking at us and shit...

79
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:05,138
I was thinking,
"If people lived in the water,

80
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,057
you'd fucking catch 'em all day."

81
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,438
They wouldn't even have to live
in the water.

82
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,233
If cheeseburgers
just floated down Geary Street...

83
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,528
at least once a week, a guy would be like,
"I'm taking a chance."

84
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,075
And you see 'em getting yanked up
to the clouds.

85
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,244
"Fuck! We lost Billy!"

86
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,746
The bottom of his sneakers
in a puff of cloud.

87
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,835
You don't catch dolphins
on fishhooks, man.

88
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,211
That's weird.

89
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,506
They're around fishing all the time
and like, "Bitch."

90
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,968
They're fucking smart. How smart?

91
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,262
Well, I watched a dolphin documentary,

92
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:50,767
and it said they have a cerebral cortex
that's 40% larger than a human being's.

93
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,062
I don't know what that means, but if you
say it right and don't fuck up the words,

94
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,981
it makes you sound smarter
than you really are.

95
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,528
I think what it means
is they have big fucking brains.

96
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,698
But we don't think of them as being smart
'cause they don't do what we do. Right?

97
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,076
They don't send e-mails.
They don't have houses.

98
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,746
But if you lived in their world,
you don't need anything.

99
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,874
You don't need your fingers.
No one's typing.

100
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,710
They have a language that's so complex,
we can't understand it.

101
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,797
All the food's free.
They stay where the water's warm.

102
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,840
I started thinking,
"How fucking smart are they?

103
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:25,385
What if they're exactly the same as us?

104
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,054
What if it's just some different branch
of evolution?

105
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,473
We went one way. They went the other.

106
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,850
What if consciousness is the same?"

107
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:36,563
I was thinking, "What if me to me
is the same as me to a dolphin?"

108
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,857
The way you think of yourself
when you say the word "me."

109
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:42,152
I was like, "What if that's exactly
how a dolphin feels?

110
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,654
They're just living life
through different biology,

111
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,240
different genetics,
different life experiences.

112
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,367
But if I lived a dolphin's life,
I would be him.

113
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,911
And if he lived my life, he would be me."

114
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:55,207
And then I started thinking,
"What if that's the case with people?

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,251
What if everyone is exactly the same?

116
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,337
We're just living life
through different bodies.

117
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,214
What if that's the secret of happiness?

118
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,175
Treat everyone
as if it's you living another life."

119
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,596
I mean...

120
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:13,058
And then I thought, "God damn, how good
is this weed I'm getting in California?

121
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,185
Whoo!

122
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,481
I'm on a fucking floating craft out
in the middle of the ocean,

123
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,149
talking to water people."

124
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,075
The problem with treating everybody
as if it's you living another life

125
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,619
is you wanna fucking smack yourself.

126
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,123
Half the people you meet,
you just wanna fucking smack 'em.

127
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,208
We live in the weirdest time ever.

128
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,668
I mean, it's the most awesome time ever.

129
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,712
But it's the weirdest time ever, too.

130
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,882
We're, like,
that close to President Trump.

131
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,886
- No. Boo!
- "No. Boo!"

132
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,222
You boo, but you won't vote, you fucks!

133
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,185
All those Bernie Sanders people,
"Yo, Bernie's the shit."

134
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:59,229
"Did you vote for him?"
"Voting ain't real, bro.

135
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,482
It doesn't even work, dude."

136
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:06,486
We are that close to President Trump.

137
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,906
Bill Cosby's a rapist,
and Bruce Jenner's a chick.

138
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,325
We're in an episode of Lost.

139
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:20,625
Down is up and up is down!

140
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,296
This is the type of world you get
when you give kids participation trophies

141
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,839
for getting their ass kicked
in soccer games.

142
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,675
This is the world we get!

143
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,015
We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world
filled with nonsense.

144
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,769
Nobody wants to be president. Nobody.
I hope Hillary wins.

145
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,522
That way we can realize
chicks can't do that fucking job either.

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,941
It's a stupid job.

147
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,612
It's a stupid job invented back
when people used to write with feathers.

148
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,281
It's dumb!

149
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,702
It's just some old-school shit
that we need to get rid of.

150
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,203
It doesn't make any sense.

151
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,540
Being president is great
if there's like 50 people.

152
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,670
If there's 50 people,
you can figure out which one's the best.

153
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,714
Three hundred million people?

154
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,967
I have three kids. I don't know
where the fuck they are right now.

155
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,430
How is this one dude
in charge of 300 million people?

156
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,141
It's nonsense.

157
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,977
It's so old and stupid.

158
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,646
They make this guy sleep
in this fucking White House.

159
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,984
If Trump wins, you know his house
is cooler than the White House.

160
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:32,155
He's like, "I'm not sleeping
in that shitty-ass, stupid house."

161
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,532
Trump's probably got, like,
a tube at home that he opens up,

162
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:38,620
and a Chinese girl just pops out of it,
and sucks his dick and goes right back in.

163
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,041
That's what I would do
if I had that kind of money.

164
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,754
We're down to assholes!

165
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,797
Where's Elon Musk when you need him?

166
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,758
Where's the fucking geniuses?

167
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,426
Where's Mark Cuban?

168
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,845
No. We got an old lady trying
to get back at her husband

169
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,805
for a blowjob he got in the '90s.

170
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,269
We got an old man who hates money.

171
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:06,856
And we got a reality TV star
with a plastic set of hair.

172
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,360
You can't have a president
with environmental concerns,

173
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,445
when every time
this motherfucker does his hair,

174
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:16,158
we lose a foot of ozone layer
and a polar bear bursts into flames.

175
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,246
He's got, like, a closet full
of Aqua Net at home.

176
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,876
You can't pretend you don't give a fuck
when you have that thing going on, dude.

177
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,211
Stop that.

178
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,299
The White House got broken into
while Obama was in office.

179
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:36,553
The first time in over 100 years
that someone broke into the White House.

180
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,682
Also, the first time a girl
was guarding the front door by herself.

181
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:45,812
"What are you trying to say, that women
can't do everything men can do?"

182
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,897
Exactly. That's exactly what I'm saying.

183
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,902
That seems sexist, right?
People say, "You're sexist."

184
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,280
No, it's not sexist.
Here's why it's not sexist.

185
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:58,575
'Cause men can't even do
everything men can do.

186
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,662
See? There's no physical equality, folks.

187
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,414
That's why we have the Olympics.

188
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,418
'Cause there's people that can do
some shit that you and I can't do.

189
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,254
One of those things is guarding
the fucking White House.

190
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,260
I know I can't guard the White House.
You know how I know?

191
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:20,472
Because I've met Shaquille O'Neal
and his dick is where my face is.

192
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,105
That's not equality.
That's not white privilege.

193
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,524
Listen, if the White House
is experiencing a Shaq Attack,

194
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:33,735
I'm the wrong dude to save the world.

195
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,529
I did Fear Factor with Shaq.

196
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,657
If we're holding hands, it'd be like
a six-year-old at the park with his dad.

197
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,494
We're barely the same thing.

198
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,499
So, do I think women should
guard the White House? No.

199
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,875
I don't think I should, either.

200
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:54,381
It's not sexist to say that women
can't do big physical labor things

201
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,133
as good as giant men can.

202
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,552
But people will tell you it is.
Well, I'm not sexist.

203
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,054
As a matter of fact,
my favorite people are all female.

204
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,475
I have a wife and I have three daughters.
They're my favorite people in the world.

205
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,479
But I could beat the fuck out
of all of them.

206
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,399
Okay? Listen...

207
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,817
If they're guarding the door,
I'm getting in.

208
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,111
I don't mean to sound cocky.

209
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,781
But I'm just real confident.

210
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,576
I could fuck them up if I had the flu.
Okay?

211
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,080
Yeah, we're different. We're different.

212
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,583
I could beat up my cat, too.

213
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,169
I'm not proud of it.
I just tell you what's up.

214
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,087
If you wanna bet money, bet money on me.

215
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,964
I'll fuck that cat up.

216
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,049
Most likely.

217
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,259
Cats are fucking weird like that, man.

218
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,680
I was petting my cat once and he bit me.
I was like, "Whoa! Are we gonna do this?

219
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,307
What the fuck are you doing here?"
I got a little nervous.

220
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,101
Got a little nervous.

221
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:54,524
"Women can do everything men can do.
This guy's a piece of shit. We're leaving.

222
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,653
Too much information is going in
that I don't agree with!"

223
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:04,241
"What the guy said was total bullshit.
Total bullshit."

224
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:06,953
How'd that girl get that job?
I'll tell you how that girl got that job.

225
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,788
Because someone let her have that job.

226
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,749
Which means, either there were a bunch
of guys that were trying to fuck her...

227
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,086
or her boss was a chick and she hated her.

228
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,716
Either one's possible.

229
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,469
Look, if there was a bunch of guys
that were trying to fuck her,

230
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:23,720
that makes total sense.

231
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,139
If there's one hot girl and she's working
with five guys in an office,

232
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,809
no work's getting done in that office.

233
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:34,063
That office is now just an audition
to see which guy gets to fuck her.

234
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:37,734
Each one of those guys
will just slowly start to morph

235
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,403
to figure out what this girl likes.

236
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,364
Men become like an octopus that tries
to fit its way through a keyhole.

237
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,494
"There's gotta be a fucking way.
There's gotta be a fucking way!"

238
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,414
You got this girl who's like,
"I could guard the front door."

239
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,668
"Oh, you could definitely guard the door.
No doubt. No doubt."

240
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:02,967
And over time, if this woman doesn't sleep
with one of these men and claim him,

241
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,428
over time,
these guys will just start morphing.

242
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,264
And they'll just start saying ridiculous,
preposterous shit.

243
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,518
"Debbie wants to guard the front door.
Do you have a problem with that?"

244
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,771
"No, I don't. As a matter of fact,
I think women are amazing.

245
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,272
Plus, I'm vegan."

246
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,775
And they will just...

247
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,317
They will wear patchouli.

248
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,987
They will do what the fuck
they have to do.

249
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,741
Next thing you know,
poor fucking Debbie at the front door...

250
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,286
"Why am I alone?"

251
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,546
The whole story is so bananas.

252
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,880
And it's one of my favorite stories.

253
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:43,508
So I'm gonna give you the whole story
of the break-in at the White House

254
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,803
with no edits and no comic exaggerations.

255
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,388
This is the real story.

256
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,682
'Cause a lot of people think
there's some grand conspiracy.

257
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,767
There's some cabal of evil geniuses

258
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,311
that's pulling the strings
on everyone in America.

259
00:14:55,395 --> 00:15:00,733
It's most likely that people
are just dumb as fuck,

260
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:02,902
in all sorts of walks of life.

261
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,320
This is the story.

262
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,156
This is the real story about the person
who broke into the White House.

263
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,409
First of all, people are always worried,

264
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,077
"The government's
checking out my e-mails, bro.

265
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,037
The government's
watching us all the time."

266
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:18,167
They pulled this guy over two months
before he broke into the White House.

267
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:23,923
He had four handguns, two rifles
and a machete with him.

268
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,177
They didn't even watch him.

269
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,388
He had a map.
On the map was Washington,

270
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,641
and it had an "X"
where the White House is.

271
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,603
They're like, "You're good to go."

272
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,605
They let him go!

273
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,691
Two months later, this motherfucker
broke into the White House.

274
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,193
And why did he break into the White House?

275
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,862
Why do you break
into the White House ever?

276
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,030
Because you want to die.

277
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,617
You don't... That's like a suicide run.

278
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,119
That's the only reason why someone
runs toward the White House.

279
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,829
If you had to ask someone,
"What kind of security

280
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,955
do you think they have
at the White House?"

281
00:15:56,038 --> 00:16:00,877
"Oh, dude...
they got snipers on every corner.

282
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,462
They got lasers in the grass.

283
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,673
If you get too far, they open up a door,
you drop right into jail."

284
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,720
Nope. Turns out they
don't even have a dog.

285
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,179
You just fucking run.

286
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:14,056
The guy who made it into the White House,

287
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,643
he had 800 rounds of ammunition
in his car.

288
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,480
Left that there. Took a knife.

289
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,941
That's a guy who wants to die!

290
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,651
He's just sitting
in his fucking car going,

291
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:29,531
"Fuck the government!
Fuck my ex-wife! And fuck everybody!

292
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:33,075
I'm gonna do this! Fuck you!"

293
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,163
Just sprinting, "Oh, my God, I'm doing it!
Oh, my God, I'm doing it!"

294
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,832
Thinking, with every step, "This is
gonna be the last step of my life.

295
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,585
No, this is gonna be the last step
of my life. No, this..."

296
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,713
And he gets to the front door.
It's unlocked!

297
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,552
He opens it.
There's a girl there by herself.

298
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:55,723
Smacks her to the ground
and just starts running through the hall.

299
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,141
Ah!

300
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,520
He's probably going, "Why am I alive?"

301
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:05,733
He's probably thinking... He was inside
for minutes. For minutes, running around.

302
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,570
He got tackled by an off-duty officer.

303
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,198
He was probably thinking,
"I wanted to die.

304
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,825
I don't want to go to fucking jail.

305
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,702
Will somebody please shoot me?"

306
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,206
Then he was probably pissed.
"Where are my tax dollars going?

307
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,334
What kind of security are you
fucking people running in this place?"

308
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,802
Imagine when Obama found out
a girl was guarding him.

309
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,349
He was probably like, "Everybody,
everybody, not that much diversity.

310
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,858
I mean, what, are you playing
fucking fairy tale games here?"

311
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,446
Obama's got a hard job,

312
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,532
'cause he's the first president that's
ever been around while Google was here.

313
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,077
You know,
he could Google his own name

314
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,246
if he gets crazy
in the middle of the night. Right?

315
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,164
"So, let me see what
the people have to say."

316
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,251
He'd just go, "Obama is a..."

317
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,216
"I'm none of those fucking things."
Freakin' out. Shit.

318
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,846
Probably thinking,
"Why the fuck did I do this?"

319
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,557
I think the guy who broke into
the White House and Obama

320
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,935
probably have a lot in common.

321
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:26,439
In that... they went for it,

322
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,901
but they probably never really thought
they were getting in there.

323
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,198
You can't quit once you're the president.

324
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:39,911
The moment Obama actually got into office,
like, "Good morning, Mr. President,"

325
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:43,831
he was probably like, "Oh, no!

326
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:46,918
What the fuck did I do this for?

327
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,503
I didn't think
I was actually gonna get in.

328
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,632
I can't sleep. I'm freaking out.

329
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,885
Everybody wants to kill me.

330
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,554
Who the fuck is guarding me?"

331
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,517
Looks out in the hallway.
There's a girl taking selfies.

332
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,900
That'd be the greatest selfie of all time.
A girl with her ass out, duck lips,

333
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,235
in the background, a dude's
breaking into the White House.

334
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,825
You know I'm not making this up.

335
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,411
You've all seen this.
This is recognizable.

336
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,666
Pigeon-toed is a good move
'cause you can't get away that good.

337
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,834
You just, like...

338
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,419
Like there's something wrong
with your back.

339
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,257
That's a recognizable pose.
When did that start?

340
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:36,884
'Cause if you look
at the original pictures

341
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,594
back when people first invented pictures,

342
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,680
everybody just stood there looking hungry.

343
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,603
Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s,
and in the background a girl was going...

344
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,397
She's a fucking time traveler!

345
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,153
Nobody knew that move back then.

346
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,489
Somebody had to see their face.

347
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,532
"Oh, people like that.
They like what I'm doing."

348
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,377
Combo. A two-hole combo attractor.

349
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,882
It's all over online!

350
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:17,466
It gets you a lot of likes.

351
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,055
I saw a gal on Instagram,
she has eight million followers.

352
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,892
All she does is take pictures of her ass.
That's it.

353
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:27,977
She's got a winning formula.
She sticks with it.

354
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,062
No witty memes.

355
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,482
There's no inspirational quotes.
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

356
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,360
Just a lot of this. Different ways.

357
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,241
And she's just a regular girl, man.

358
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:46,078
I'm watching this, I'm like,
"This is a different kind of person."

359
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:50,416
She has eight million people that have
no idea what her voice sounds like.

360
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,168
She doesn't have a job that they like.

361
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,170
She doesn't have an occupation
that they follow.

362
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:57,256
They're just staring at her ass.
This is a new kind of human.

363
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,302
There's never been a person,
psychologically,

364
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,763
that's had to navigate
those kind of waters.

365
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:05,014
If you really stop and think about it,

366
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,684
science should really step in
and start looking at this.

367
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:13,689
Don't go to South America to study some
new frog that nobody gives a fuck about.

368
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,359
There's a girl in Florida with
eight million people staring at her ass.

369
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,155
How does this girl keep a relationship?

370
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,866
What is her day like?

371
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,203
How many dick pics does she get sent?

372
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,372
How many dick pics does
that girl receive on a daily basis?

373
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,166
Is it like the national debt counter

374
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,044
was just fucking spinning
out of control constantly?

375
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,462
I bet if she turns on the notifications,

376
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,924
her phone just starts screaming
and runs away from her.

377
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,093
I bet if she deletes
all the dick pics from her phone,

378
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,011
it would be physically lighter.

379
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,432
This is a new kind of person.

380
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,645
We really have to understand, there's
never been a person like this before.

381
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,900
And she's just a person.

382
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:03,072
Like, that kind of influence,
that kind of attractant,

383
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:07,994
that's a very strong drug to have
in the hands of just a girl.

384
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,412
And as a guy who has daughters,

385
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:14,250
I just think of that, like,
that's kind of fucking... That's weird.

386
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,962
Because this girl has
eight million people staring at her ass.

387
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:23,676
Eight million creeps and weirdos
and perverts objectifying her.

388
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,138
I mean, I follow her,
but I'm not like those other assholes.

389
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,640
I'm different.

390
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,102
I care. I care about who she is.

391
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,898
I'm a nice person.
I'm a hero or something.

392
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,153
"I'm different.
Those other guys are assholes.

393
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:45,447
Men are noble. Men are noble and true."

394
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,491
Mmm. If we get to come.

395
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:53,122
If men don't get to come,
we get real Sméagol-like real quick.

396
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,499
Just a few months of no dates,

397
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,169
"Mesus is just so disappointed

398
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:01,338
with all the mens mesus meets.

399
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,967
Mesus is so embarrassed

400
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:08,804
at how other mens talks to you. Mmm.

401
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:12,934
Oh."

402
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:19,856
Everyone wants to set themselves up
as being the noble one.

403
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,733
Everybody wants to be
Matthew McConaughey,

404
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,277
to save the world on a rocket ship.

405
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,783
There's people that are signing up
to go to Mars.

406
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:31,953
Do you know about this?

407
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,414
There's a mission to Mars,
a manned mission to Mars,

408
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:40,544
where 200,000 people have signed up to be
amongst the four people to die on Mars.

409
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,132
They're gonna take a one-way trip to Mars.

410
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:48,510
That's some sad shit
for a bunch of reasons.

411
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,928
First of all, it's some sad shit,

412
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:54,266
'cause that's 200,000 people
that don't have any real friends. Right?

413
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,227
If it's someone you love,
your real friend...

414
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,728
If one of my friends
is gonna move to Florida,

415
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,189
I'll be like,
"Bitch, where the fuck are you going?

416
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,774
You're gonna go to Florida?
We can't hang out if you go to Florida.

417
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,444
Why the fuck are you moving
to Florida, man?"

418
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,612
But you might be able to deal with it.

419
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,447
"We can just visit each other
every now and then."

420
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,449
But if your friend was gonna move to Mars,

421
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,869
you'd be like,
"Oh, really? Get in the fucking car!

422
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,871
Just get in the car, dude."

423
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,207
Take him out to Death Valley,
"Look around!

424
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,293
Sucks, right?

425
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:25,506
Mars sucks worse.
Get back in the car, stupid."

426
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,758
Jesus Christ!

427
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,553
There's places in America
you can't live, man.

428
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,763
You don't wanna live in Detroit,

429
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,890
why the fuck are you talking
about moving to Mars?

430
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:40,146
People really consider moving to Mars.

431
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,398
It's one of the dumbest ideas ever.

432
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,234
But if you say that,
people will eco-bro you.

433
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,070
Have you ever been eco-broed?

434
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:53,075
These people will find an opportunity
to virtue signal over you,

435
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,077
as Michael Shermer likes to point out.

436
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:59,081
Like, puff their chest out and say
that they're probably better than you.

437
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,499
"Hey, dude. Seriously?

438
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,418
You think there's something wrong
with going to Mars?

439
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,960
Well, I don't know
if you've paid attention, man.

440
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:07,839
We maybe should colonize Mars
'cause California's almost out of water."

441
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,344
Then he'll nod, like, "Yeah, bitch."

442
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,348
We're right next to the ocean.
What the fuck are you talking about?

443
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,601
Look at all that water.
You fly over it, it takes a day.

444
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:22,688
The world's blue.
It's more water than it is not water.

445
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:26,192
We have a salt problem.
We don't have a water problem.

446
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,070
Suck the salt out of the water,
we got a goddamn party.

447
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,363
Instead of pissing and moaning...

448
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,783
"Too complicated, bro.
We gotta go to Neptune."

449
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,703
Oh, my God! You're fucking crazy.

450
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,539
We're a crazy race filled
with crazy people.

451
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,542
We're like a dude with a dirty house.
Like, "Man, I gotta build a new house."

452
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,211
No, you gotta stop shitting
in your kitchen.

453
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,797
Stop piling up newspapers
you're never gonna read

454
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,466
in front of your bathroom, you fuck!

455
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,801
We're crazy!

456
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,890
One-way trip to Mars.
A one-way trip in coach

457
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:03,562
with three other people so fucking stupid,
they're willing to die on Mars with you.

458
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:06,232
Great. What great conversation
you're gonna have.

459
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,151
It's nonsense, folks.

460
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,570
My friend was like,
"They're not gonna die on Mars, man.

461
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,822
If people are smart enough
to figure out how to get to Mars,

462
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,325
they're smart enough
to figure out how to get back."

463
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,619
Here's why that doesn't make any sense.

464
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:22,456
People smart enough to get to Mars
aren't going.

465
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:28,837
See, that's the dirty secret
about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen.

466
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,343
Nobody smart enough to make a rocket
ever gets in one of those fucking things.

467
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,139
No. No, they look at each other
right before the launch and they go...

468
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:44,270
They talk German and they
get behind giant fucking concrete bunkers.

469
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,692
They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude
from the middle of the country,

470
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:54,446
tuck a Bible under that dude's arm
and strap him into that giant metal dick,

471
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,114
and shoot it off into the heavens.

472
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,286
That's what we do.

473
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:03,539
And that is what that is.
That is a metal dick.

474
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,084
It's a robot dick,
and we're trying to fuck the sky.

475
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:11,547
We are literally trying to come people out
of the tip of a metal dick

476
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,965
onto other planets.

477
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,054
Our ultimate goal
is that we get those planets pregnant,

478
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,889
and they're too filled up with people,

479
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,767
and then they gotta make a new metal dick.
"Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter."

480
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,144
Then they make another one.
They shoot that fucking thing,

481
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,396
and they fill Jupiter up.

482
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,149
We just keep filling the cosmos up
with people.

483
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:32,484
And we never evolve.
And we never change.

484
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,861
We stay perfect, like we are right now.

485
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,905
Who's in?

486
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,409
You're gonna all come with me.
We're gonna leave here right now

487
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,994
and go to the Church of Scientology
right down the street,

488
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,414
and it's all gonna make sense
when you find out

489
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:49,501
that you are an eternal being that created
reality so that you can enjoy it.

490
00:27:52,588 --> 00:27:56,132
I watched that HBO documentary
a couple too many times.

491
00:27:56,217 --> 00:28:00,011
I went Clear, I think. I think I'm Clear.
I'm back! I'm back now.

492
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,347
If you haven't seen...

493
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,391
I had to watch Going Clear,
a Scientology documentary,

494
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,017
'cause I have a neighbor
who's a Scientologist,

495
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,062
and I don't even think he's gay.
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

496
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,649
But he sleeps really close to me,
you know.

497
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,028
Like, my bed's here, this fucking dude's
bed's, like, over there. His house is...

498
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,114
I mean, if you take away the walls,
he's fucking right there.

499
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,450
It's like,
"What does this crazy fuck believe?"

500
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,036
And Scientology is a wonderful religion.

501
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,289
Not just because it was written
by a science fiction author

502
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,665
who wrote more fake shit

503
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,127
than anyone that's ever walked
the face of the Earth.

504
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,629
And not by a small amount.

505
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,715
This dude never made a second draft
in his fucking life.

506
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,885
Everything was one draft of nonsense.

507
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,846
And he wrote more of it than anybody.

508
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:47,058
Not in his neighborhood, not in his state,
not in a year, not in a decade.

509
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,229
More than anyone that's ever lived, ever.

510
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:53,482
And Scientology is still like,
"I don't see any red flags.

511
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,067
I think we're good.
I think this is legit as fuck."

512
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,822
If Scientology is a good religion,

513
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:03,242
it's because other religions
get to make fun of 'em.

514
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,576
It's like it's the one religion

515
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,788
that even the Mormons are like,
"Bitch, you believe what?

516
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,753
Hold on. I mean, at least
we don't have video of Joseph Smith.

517
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,799
There's some fucking shitty
black and white footage

518
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,759
of L. Ron Hubbard
with a captain's outfit on.

519
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,928
You wanna explain that?

520
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,180
Why does he have all those awards on?

521
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,850
Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal
the size of a dinner plate?

522
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,938
What the fuck is going on
with you people?"

523
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,233
I watched it with my mom,
and it was like...

524
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:41,029
First of all, Scientology,
they don't pay taxes.

525
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,115
That's disturbing. They're tax-free,

526
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,577
which means they're a recognized religion
by the government of the United States.

527
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,036
Which means the government
of the United States

528
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,456
had to go over what they believe

529
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,874
and went, "Everything seems in order.

530
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,462
None of this shit seems like a cult."

531
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,632
Well, what the fuck is a cult,
and what's a religion?

532
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:01,967
So I had to look it up.

533
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,971
Turns out... I don't know who wrote this,
but it's a perfect definition.

534
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,598
A cult is bullshit.

535
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:11,560
It's created by one person.
That person knows it's bullshit.

536
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,646
In a religion, that dude's dead.

537
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,862
So it's a religion

538
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,365
'cause L. Ron Hubbard's dead.

539
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,450
So I guess they got it on a loophole.

540
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,746
I watched it with my mom,

541
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,289
and my mom was like, "I can't believe
anybody would fall for that."

542
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,418
"You made me go to Catholic school.

543
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,046
The fuck are you talking about?

544
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:44,259
There was a child molester dressed like
a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne,

545
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,136
and you made me call him Father.

546
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,930
Slow your roll, lady."

547
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,603
Imagine if I talked to my mom like that.
Oh, my God.

548
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:57,606
Jokes, folks. Just jokes.

549
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,443
I don't have a problem
with people being religious

550
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,029
because I just think life itself
is too open-ended.

551
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,196
It's too confusing.

552
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,948
And I think we're evolving.

553
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,619
And part of our struggle in evolving
is unanswered questions.

554
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,538
We wanna seek these answers.
But in the meanwhile,

555
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,707
they just give you so much anxiety,
and it fucks with you so much.

556
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,501
There's nothing wrong with joining a cult.

557
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,961
I think you gotta just join
a nice, friendly one.

558
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:24,633
Like, the Mormons are a good cult.

559
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,220
Here's why.
They don't get mad at anybody.

560
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,473
Like, they never kill anybody.
Like, here's a perfect example.

561
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,393
Matt Stone and Trey Parker,
the guys who created South Park,

562
00:31:34,476 --> 00:31:37,062
they made a hilarious musical called
The Book of Mormon.

563
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,229
It's fantastic.

564
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,816
If you haven't seen it,
it's so fucking hilarious.

565
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:45,696
But it's also brutal!
Brutal about the Mormons.

566
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,155
You know what the Mormons did?

567
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:51,201
They went to see it, and they took out
a full-page ad in the playbill.

568
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,036
It said, "If you enjoyed this musical

569
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,038
and you wanna find out more
about being a Mormon,

570
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,498
please visit our website."

571
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,294
They just took it right on the chin
like champs.

572
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,380
They didn't get mad.
They didn't get defensive.

573
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,132
They didn't kill anybody.

574
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,676
That's a good cult.

575
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,012
They just said, "What do you wanna do?"

576
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:12,931
"We got nine wives. Shut the fuck up!"

577
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,015
"Everybody just...

578
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,394
Everybody, just chill. Just chill."

579
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,897
That's a good religion.

580
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,398
That's a good cult.

581
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,942
Some cults aren't that good.

582
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,945
They get fucking testy. You know the one.

583
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,658
We don't have to say who.
You know what I'm talking about.

584
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,578
There's that one that will kill you
if you draw their guy.

585
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,956
"Come on, man.
I can't even draw your dude?

586
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,126
What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?"

587
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,335
"No loopholes!"

588
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,380
"Fuckin' relax, bro."

589
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,634
And this isn't just theoretical.

590
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,802
People have died
'cause they made cartoons.

591
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:55,015
Before the most recent Paris attacks,
there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo,

592
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:58,059
and they were attacked,
where 11 cartoonists were killed.

593
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:01,563
Eleven more were wounded,
and they killed a cop, too.

594
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,191
Fucking crazy! Over cartoons!

595
00:33:04,274 --> 00:33:06,318
And when you...

596
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,488
When there's radical, crazy people
in the world,

597
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:13,158
what's interesting is the reaction
to radical, crazy people

598
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,244
and how everything just sort of
kind of balances itself out

599
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,954
when things get weird.

600
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:21,875
Because when these people
got killed over a cartoon,

601
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,920
the whole world was in shock.
The whole world was outraged.

602
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:29,633
But one of the scariest things about it
was nobody wanted to print those pictures.

603
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,303
You couldn't see 'em in the LA Times.
You couldn't find them in Time magazine.

604
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,681
You had to go online and find them.

605
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,767
It was a dark moment for free speech,
because everybody's like,

606
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,853
"Oh. I don't wanna get killed.
I don't wanna show the pictures."

607
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:46,983
It was weird, until... the balance.

608
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,195
Because after they got killed
and nobody wanted to print the pictures,

609
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,280
word got back to Texas...

610
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:58,995
where they promptly held a "Draw Muhammad"
contest in Garland, Texas.

611
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,333
I'm not making a word of this up.
You can Google it, and I'll wait.

612
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,713
They had a "Draw Muhammad" contest
in Garland, Texas.

613
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,049
Two dudes showed up,
started shooting at the building.

614
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,719
They were killed almost instantly.

615
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,555
Why?

616
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,766
Because they were
at a "Draw Muhammad" contest in Texas.

617
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:23,937
How obvious does a trap have to be
before you start getting suspicious?

618
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:30,652
What, are you livin'
in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherfucker?

619
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:33,529
You ever go to Texas?

620
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:34,990
That's not Santa Monica, bitch.

621
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,450
That's a totally different kind
of white people.

622
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:44,625
Those are some Wild West people
that have computers and modern guns.

623
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,501
They're not supposed to be there.

624
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,588
People didn't evolve in Texas.

625
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,590
It's not like they were monkeys,
then they became people

626
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,883
and they stayed in that spot. No.

627
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,636
No, they landed on boats
on the East Coast.

628
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,263
The stubborn ones stayed.

629
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,431
The smart ones made it to California.

630
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,851
But along the way,
we lost a bunch of people.

631
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,774
And some of them just stuck around.

632
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,441
"Y'all go ahead.
We're gonna hang back here.

633
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,862
I'm gonna draw the biggest dick
the world's ever seen in the sand.

634
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,405
My wife's got the biggest titties.

635
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,033
I'mma try to fuck a snake.
I think it can be done."

636
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,368
They just stayed.

637
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,289
They just gathered cattle,
stockpiled ammo.

638
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,125
And they all talk alike.
And that's why you gotta be nervous.

639
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,878
You gotta be nervous
in places with accents, okay?

640
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,090
It's one of the reasons why I can prove
that California is the best spot to live.

641
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:38,303
'Cause all the spots that suck,
they all have to sound like each other.

642
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,181
'Cause I grew up in a place like that.
I grew up in Boston.

643
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,309
It's not that the people in Boston suck,
but the weather sucks.

644
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,852
It's fucking horrible.

645
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,229
And in the winter everybody gets
in their car in the morning,

646
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,481
and just goes,
"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

647
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,984
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!"

648
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,069
And everybody's worried about...

649
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,822
It's a real possibility
you might starve to death one day.

650
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,282
You might freeze trying to walk home.

651
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,326
So they all talk in the same way.

652
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:04,370
"Oh, my God.
How many more months till summer?

653
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,706
Ahhh!

654
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,416
When is this fucking winter gonna be over?

655
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,835
We need more firewood."

656
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,172
They have to sound
like the people around them.

657
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,175
So if other people invade, like,
"We stick together.

658
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,094
We're all in this together."

659
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:21,512
That's how they are in Texas, too.

660
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,473
They're like,
"Y'all ain't from around here, are ya?"

661
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,516
They have a fucking certain way
of talking.

662
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,478
Which is proof positive why California
is the best spot.

663
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,981
Try making fun of a California accent.

664
00:36:31,064 --> 00:36:32,774
What are you gonna do?
Speak clear and concise?

665
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,651
What are you gonna do?

666
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,697
You gonna mock us?

667
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,117
You're gonna say some shit
that everybody understands?

668
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,540
They're not supposed to be
in Texas, folks.

669
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,001
It's not even a state.

670
00:36:51,084 --> 00:36:52,543
It's a republic.

671
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,421
They were like, "Man, we ain't so sure
about this whole United States thing.

672
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,132
We're gonna hang back.

673
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,384
Hang back, see how this plays out."

674
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,513
They don't have any rules. They have
like three pages of rule books.

675
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,057
Here's how I know this.
I'm gonna tell you a fact,

676
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,560
a fact about Texas that will change
the way you think about Texas.

677
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:14,690
There are more tigers
in captivity in Texas,

678
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:17,235
in private collections,

679
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,697
than there are in all of the wild
of the world.

680
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:28,371
I'm gonna repeat it
because I know you're like,

681
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,000
"Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making
shit up to make his jokes work."

682
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:39,257
No. There's more tigers
in dudes' yards in Texas

683
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,260
than the rest of the fucking planet!

684
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,095
How is that possible?

685
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,471
Because they can.

686
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,557
Because they went through the rule book...

687
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,392
"It don't say shit about tigers.
Order it up, dude.

688
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,938
Order it up, dude!"

689
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:54,272
One guy got a tiger,

690
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:57,776
and his neighbor's like,
"Shit, I didn't know we could get tigers."

691
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,069
And he got two tigers.

692
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,238
And the first guy was like, "I ain't about
to let this faggot out-tiger me."

693
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,201
And he opened up Tiger World
with his oil money.

694
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:13,458
We're gonna need those people, folks,
if the Russians invade.

695
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:17,753
We can't make fucking warrior babies
with those chicks in Marin County

696
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,590
with fake asses and rubber lips, okay?

697
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,634
We're gonna need some real warrior genes.

698
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,847
We're gonna need some women
who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes.

699
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,892
They got cowboy boots
with no socks and stinky feet.

700
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,977
And they yell out,
"Chris Kyle, rest in peace,"

701
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,520
when you make 'em come.

702
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,065
We need those women!

703
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,988
If the Russians come, we gotta be ready.

704
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,489
Think about the children.

705
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,076
Think about the children
while I get a sip.

706
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,870
This is super important,
ladies and gentlemen.

707
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,454
A lot of people are sleeping on...

708
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:54,916
Imagine if I had real points.

709
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,251
Oh, Jesus Christ.

710
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,631
I love you fuckers, too, man.

711
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,592
So excited to be here.

712
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,263
I have kids and I lie to them.

713
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,391
I get high around 'em, too.

714
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,227
People say you shouldn't do that,
but they don't see it.

715
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,648
They say you shouldn't be intoxicated
around your children.

716
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,275
Well, I'm not. I'm high.

717
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:23,444
I call it "elevated." It's a different thing.

718
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,364
The people who have a problem with that,

719
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,824
they don't understand
what getting high is.

720
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:31,786
Like, they think you're gonna be
to your kid, like, "Who are you?"

721
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:34,998
What do you think?

722
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:38,043
What's the worst thing that can happen
if I'm a little high around my kid?

723
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,210
They're gonna get extra hugs,

724
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,337
and daddy's going to be
paranoid about objects.

725
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:42,463
"Look out.

726
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,924
Don't go there."

727
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,177
That's it.
Plus, I have cool conversations.

728
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,721
I have a six-year-old daughter, man.

729
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:55,268
There's not a lot of 48-year-old man
and 6-year-old girl have in common,

730
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,895
other than the fact she's my daughter.

731
00:39:56,978 --> 00:39:59,981
And so, our conversations
are normally pretty boring.

732
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:04,027
But when I'm high, I'm like, "You know,
you call that thing your baby, your doll.

733
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,072
You call it your baby,
but you know it's not a baby, right?"

734
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,491
"Yeah, I know it's not a baby."

735
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,493
"Do you call it a baby
because you're the youngest

736
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:16,831
and you like having someone
who is responsible for you?"

737
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:18,583
"Maybe."

738
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,044
"Okay. That's cool. That's cool.
Give me a hug. I love you."

739
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,134
It's weird, man.
It's weird raising little people.

740
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,553
There's some things that I didn't expect.

741
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,223
One of the things I didn't expect
is you have to lie to them.

742
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,017
Like, you don't have to lie to them
about a lot of things,

743
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:38,353
but you have to lie to them
about Santa Claus.

744
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,481
It's just one of those things, man,
'cause it's like a community.

745
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,317
You have to think about what your kid's
gonna tell other kids.

746
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,152
Because when it comes to Santa Claus,

747
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,946
you don't want your kid
to be one of two things.

748
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,740
You don't want your kid
to be the first kid

749
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,534
that tells everyone
that Santa Claus is bullshit,

750
00:40:53,618 --> 00:40:55,161
'cause that kid's an asshole.

751
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:57,956
But you don't want your kid
to be the last kid

752
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,875
that figures out
that Santa Claus is bullshit,

753
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,252
'cause that kid's a moron.

754
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:05,088
So you got... You got a little bit of...

755
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,632
You're like, "Oh, no.

756
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,343
When do we do this?
When do we do this?"

757
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,928
And no one knows when to do it.
You just let the kids figure it out.

758
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,515
Then they're like, "Dad, what the fuck?"
You're like, "Aw...

759
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,225
Oh, I missed the boat.
I missed the boat."

760
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,811
Nobody knows when to do it.
Nobody can be honest about it.

761
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,272
They have little meetings and shit.

762
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:25,441
And I'm like, "When do we tell 'em?"
This lady goes, "When they're 11."

763
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,277
They're gonna be fucking by then.

764
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,283
I told her it was funny.
She didn't believe me.

765
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:35,576
I'm like, "Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm off by a year."

766
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,122
That's not as funny, but it's...

767
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,456
I didn't mean it.

768
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,419
But it's this thing.
They want to keep the kids in the dark.

769
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,297
And they wanna pretend they're
the only one that's teaching the kid.

770
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,464
This is a weird thing that people do.

771
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,883
They're like, "I teach my kids, man.
I teach my kids."

772
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,760
"Eh... when you see 'em."

773
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,806
But unless you're some freak who
homeschools your children in the forest,

774
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,058
your kid's gonna go to school.

775
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,935
They're gonna go to school, and they're
gonna be in a class with 50 other kids.

776
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,854
The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year,
and she's thinking about dick.

777
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,065
That's all she's thinking about.

778
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,399
She's thinking about getting stuffed.

779
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,110
She's a young, fertile woman
who loves kids.

780
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,611
And she's writing on that chalkboard.

781
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,198
And the kids all huddle up
and share information.

782
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,741
Like, "Yeah, what did your dad tell you?
Your dad tell you that, yeah?

783
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:19,120
My dad says Santa Claus
is fucking bullshit, okay?

784
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,330
You ever go near a chimney?

785
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:22,290
It's that big. What the fuck?

786
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,667
Teacher's coming. Play with blocks.

787
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,127
Act stupid.

788
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,920
Uh, how does this work?"

789
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:30,214
They play dumb. They play dumb!

790
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,759
They're like little prisoners,
trying to figure their way out.

791
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,804
They make little papier-mâché heads
and pretend they're napping.

792
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,060
They're little humans.

793
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,228
They wanna run shit.

794
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:45,605
"Who is these people
telling us what to do?

795
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,607
Are they being straight with us, man?

796
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,442
What the fuck is going on?"

797
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:54,322
I knew the day my daughter knew
that Santa Claus is bullshit.

798
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:57,867
She came home, stared me down.

799
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,247
She was, like, mad-dogging me.

800
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,707
She took her book bag,
and just goes...

801
00:43:07,127 --> 00:43:08,669
Walked right up to the chimney,

802
00:43:08,753 --> 00:43:10,004
looking at me.

803
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,220
"How the fuck?"

804
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,398
"Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?"

805
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,442
"No, honey, I've never met him."

806
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,320
"But you let him in the house?"

807
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,411
And there's this moment...

808
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,913
It was a moment where a seven-year-old
has you at checkmate.

809
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,166
You're like, "Oh, shit."

810
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,171
I don't know whether to high-five her
or to keep lying.

811
00:43:52,213 --> 00:43:55,049
You wanna go, "Yeah, you got me.
You got me. You got me. That's bullshit.

812
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,552
No, the big bang is real,
but this is bullshit."

813
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,222
The big bang sounds even less real.

814
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,683
The problem is, you have to be consistent.

815
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:07,603
If you're teaching your kids nonsense,
you gotta teach 'em only nonsense.

816
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,940
You can't mix nonsense
in with, like, real stuff.

817
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,193
Like, my daughter will go like,
"How do birds fly?"

818
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,612
I go, "Birds have bones that are hollow,
so they're really light.

819
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,199
Then they have feathers,
which cover a large surface area.

820
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:21,242
And they use the hollow bones
and the feathers

821
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,203
to push down on the air.

822
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:24,954
See, the air looks
like it's nothing, right?

823
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,539
But it's actually a bunch of gases.

824
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,083
That's why the trees move
when the wind blows.

825
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,794
The birds can manipulate that
and go through 3-D space."

826
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,214
"Whoa!"

827
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:36,048
"Yeah, nature is crazy."

828
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,217
"Yeah.

829
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,051
How does the fat man
get through the little hole?"

830
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,595
"Magic!

831
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,722
Christmas magic!

832
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,432
Now go to bed.
I'm trying to fuck your mom!

833
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,683
Go to bed!"

834
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,064
Jokes, folks. Just jokes.

835
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,317
Can't talk like that.
That's how you make strippers.

836
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,069
You gotta be nice.
They're little, tiny people.

837
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:58,613
They're adorable.
They don't know anything yet.

838
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,072
You gotta teach 'em everything.

839
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,910
You can't talk mean.

840
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,580
Kids are a lot like
really fucking stupid people...

841
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,751
in that if you get
ten really stupid people in a room,

842
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,920
the most confident one
just starts running shit.

843
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,006
They don't have to have
any more information,

844
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,424
they just have to be more confident.

845
00:45:18,508 --> 00:45:19,675
If you get a bunch of dummies together,

846
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,344
they're like,
"I don't know what's going on."

847
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,762
"I don't know what's going on."

848
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,848
"I fucking do. I fucking do."

849
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,435
The guy doesn't have to have
any extra data,

850
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:31,937
he just has to be
the only one that's confident.

851
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,982
And that's what it's like in school.

852
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:37,735
My daughter's class
has this fucking kid named Debbie.

853
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:40,363
And every day it's, "Debbie says..."

854
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,282
Oh, fucking Debbie says.

855
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,451
Debbie says what?

856
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,453
You don't think about that
before you have kids.

857
00:45:47,537 --> 00:45:49,664
Not only are you gonna have kids,

858
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,081
but your kids are gonna make friends,

859
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,377
and then you have to make friends
with the fucking parents of your kids.

860
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,087
And some of 'em are crazy.

861
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,508
My daughter's like, "Debbie says

862
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,885
Adam and Eve
are the only two people in the world,

863
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,220
and all people came from them.
Is that true?"

864
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,312
And this is weird.
Like, you don't know what to do, right?

865
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,438
You want to be diplomatic.

866
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:15,481
You don't want
to cause problems at school.

867
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:16,607
But you gotta be honest.

868
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:20,027
And one of the most difficult things
to say to a kid is, "I don't know."

869
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,237
I'm like, "Sweetie, I don't know.

870
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,324
I don't know if Adam and Eve
is where people came from.

871
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:25,950
But nobody knows,

872
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:30,246
because no one from today
is alive back then.

873
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,415
So it's not something you can measure.

874
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,250
So it's not something you can see.
So we don't know.

875
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:37,002
But here's what we do know.

876
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:41,048
You know how some people have big ears
and some people have little ears?"

877
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,050
"Yeah."

878
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:47,221
"Well, some people have brains
that are made out of dog shit.

879
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:50,975
And they get horny, too.

880
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:52,101
And what happens is,

881
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,645
they have to find someone
even dumber than them to have sex with.

882
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:56,981
It's like the opposite of evolution.

883
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,108
And then they have a kid,
and their kid is fucked.

884
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,360
Their kid is fucked!

885
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:02,362
And everybody wants to pretend
it's a level playing field.

886
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,029
There's no level, anywhere you look.

887
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:07,658
Is an eagle and a salmon level?
Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle?

888
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,536
No. The universe does not want even!

889
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:14,332
It wants conflict and resolution
and constant improvement. Okay?

890
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,500
I'm gonna shut this light out,

891
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,252
and I'm gonna go fuck your mom
right in the mouth. All right?"

892
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,754
I don't say these things.

893
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,214
I don't say any of these things!

894
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,679
I was like, "I don't know.
Maybe Debbie's right.

895
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:30,556
Doesn't make sense to me.

896
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,392
How would that work?"

897
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:33,476
"How would that work?"

898
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,436
"It wouldn't work, would it?"

899
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,772
Adam and Eve are the only two people.
They have kids.

900
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,190
And then,
where do all the other people come from?

901
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,277
I guess the kids just start fucking
each other. Is that what happens?

902
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,405
Mom fucks the kids, or the...

903
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,865
Yeah, exactly.

904
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,286
Debbie's parents.
They were at my house, man, for a cookout,

905
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,747
and the dude told me
the Earth's 10,000 years old.

906
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,209
They're Young Earth Christians.
They're sweet people, by the way.

907
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,379
Before I shit on them...
I'm gonna shit on them,

908
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:05,299
but before I shit on them, they're sweet.
They're really nice people.

909
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,636
I hug 'em every time I see 'em.
They're really kind, nice people.

910
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,598
But they just found a part of their brain,
they're like, "I have no use for this."

911
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:18,270
Chucked that whole logic,
discerning-reason part.

912
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,523
"This fucking thing's confusing."

913
00:48:22,817 --> 00:48:24,318
They're Young Earth Christians,

914
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,864
which means they follow the strictest
interpretation of the Bible possible.

915
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,202
I'm like, "How many people believe
the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?"

916
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,245
Uh! I looked it up.

917
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,997
There's a recent Gallup poll that said

918
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:43,045
that 46% of America believes
the Earth is less than 10,000 years old.

919
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,674
Here's why you shouldn't be scared.

920
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:49,594
They can only measure people
dumb enough to answer polls.

921
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,263
And when you factor that in,

922
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,850
you're talking
about a really small number.

923
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,935
'Cause you know
what the average response is

924
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,187
if you call people up and say,
"How old's the Earth?"

925
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:03,232
Number one answer is,
"Older than your mother's pussy."

926
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:05,818
And then they hang up.

927
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,363
Number two answer is, "Fuck you!"

928
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:12,575
After that,
you start throwing numbers around.

929
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:14,869
And only 46% of those dummies

930
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,663
were stupid enough to think
the Earth is 10,000 years old.

931
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:19,749
That's Debbie's fucking parents.

932
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:22,334
So out of the people that answer polls...
Is it even 1%?

933
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:23,628
It might be 1%.

934
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,921
Only 46% are that fucking stupid.

935
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,717
And that's the 1%
we should really be worried about.

936
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,927
We're worried about the wrong 1%.

937
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:34,429
Not that we shouldn't be worried
about the really rich, greedy people.

938
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:37,808
We definitely should. We should definitely
worry about bankers and people who...

939
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,894
They're just stockpiling resources.

940
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:44,732
They could help the world in some
really impossible ways for anybody else.

941
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,235
But they don't. They'd rather
just pile up their gold.

942
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,237
Yeah, that 1% is awful.

943
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,824
But there's another 1% that freaks me
the fuck out that no one's talking about.

944
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:56,952
That's the 1% who leave comments
on YouTube videos.

945
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,749
Who the fuck are those freaks?

946
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,502
Could you imagine people talking
to each other like that in real life

947
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,505
and not beating the shit out
of each other?

948
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:11,884
I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back
from the dead and had a YouTube page,

949
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,218
the first comment would be,

950
00:50:13,302 --> 00:50:15,220
"You ain't shit without your dad, pussy."

951
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,183
These are monsters.

952
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,811
This is not a normal person's response.

953
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,896
Normal people don't leave comments.

954
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,816
What a normal person does,
they watch a video.

955
00:50:26,899 --> 00:50:28,192
They like it or they don't like it.

956
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,110
That's it. It ends right there.

957
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:33,280
But what you're dealing with
is the process of racism,

958
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:36,408
and child abuse,
and neglect and shitty genes.

959
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,703
And the Insane Clown Posse is playing.

960
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:41,789
They know all the words,
and they're wafting up their farts,

961
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,583
and their Cheez Doodle fingers.

962
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:45,960
And like,
"An open letter to Jennifer Lopez...

963
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:49,630
Let me pause and just jerk off
in my shirt real quick, here.

964
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,090
Ugh...

965
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,174
Dear, Jennifer,

966
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:55,427
don't you think it's about time
you dress a little more classy?

967
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,012
What are your children gonna see
when they see..."

968
00:50:57,096 --> 00:51:00,891
Just fucking think of the meanest,
most biting shit that's gonna cut it.

969
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:03,644
As if Jennifer Lopez has time

970
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:07,272
in between eating diamonds
and fucking all her background dancers

971
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,483
in a castle that she built with her ass.

972
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,653
But you know, "Let me check
the YouTube comments

973
00:51:12,737 --> 00:51:15,364
to see if my self-esteem's on point. Oh!"

974
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,034
And you know who's dumber than them?

975
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:22,246
Me. 'Cause I read their shit
and I get mad.

976
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,000
I know they're stupid.
I still get upset. Fuck!

977
00:51:29,712 --> 00:51:32,172
This is the world, folks.
This is the world we're living in.

978
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,217
Are we happy? I'm not sure.

979
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:37,261
- Is this what we wanted? I don't know.
- No!

980
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,596
- No.
- No!

981
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,598
- Are you sure?
- No!

982
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,058
Why are you doing this? What is this?

983
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,685
What are you doing?
Are you fighting for freedom?

984
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,020
- What's happening?
- No!

985
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,731
Are you White Panthers?
What is this?

986
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:49,857
Life sucks!

987
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,026
- What are you saying?
- Life can kind of suck sometimes.

988
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,527
Life can kind of suck?

989
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,946
Maybe it's how you're livin' it, bitch.

990
00:51:57,782 --> 00:51:59,324
"Life can kind of suck."

991
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,202
It's the greatest time ever to be alive.

992
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,914
"Yeah, I'd live in the old days
when you could die from crabs."

993
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,083
It doesn't get any better than today, man.

994
00:52:09,293 --> 00:52:10,294
So stupid.

995
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,545
"Make America great again."

996
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:14,006
It's as good as it's ever been.
What the fuck are you saying?

997
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,758
We have 4G everywhere.

998
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:19,929
When has it been better?
We have Netflix.

999
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:21,931
When has it been better?

1000
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:23,932
Come on, man. Stop.
It's never been better.

1001
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:27,687
This is as good as it's ever been.
It's just weird. It's just weird.

1002
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:30,022
You gotta get your shit together, bitch.
Don't blame the world.

1003
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,274
God damn it. Damn it, man.

1004
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,696
And listen,
if you've seen any of this show,

1005
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,990
and you said, "I think some of the stuff
you're saying is really funny,

1006
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:43,369
but I sense a lot of, like,
macho posturing from you.

1007
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,288
I sense a lot of, like, bullshit,
tough-guy stuff."

1008
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,040
You're totally correct.

1009
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:52,920
And what it is
is I live with all women, okay?

1010
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,381
And I'm becoming more of a bitch
every day of my life.

1011
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:59,384
And I just wanna say I'm not unhappy.

1012
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:01,762
I've never been more happy in my life.

1013
00:53:01,846 --> 00:53:04,264
This is the happiest I've ever been.

1014
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:08,227
But when you're with all girls,
like, you have all girls all the time,

1015
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,187
you have to make little compromises.

1016
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,688
You don't think about it
while it's happening.

1017
00:53:11,772 --> 00:53:15,067
It's like the rock doesn't think
about the water carving a path through it,

1018
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,903
but eventually,
that fucking path is gonna get deep.

1019
00:53:17,987 --> 00:53:20,572
And when you're with all people
that are different than you,

1020
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,491
they just go, "Hmm..."

1021
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:26,078
They just start looking at you
like little raptors testing the fence.

1022
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,956
They'll just start poking at you.

1023
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,542
It's what people do. It's natural.

1024
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,753
It's just what people do.

1025
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,756
If you live with people that all are
on AT&T and you're on Verizon,

1026
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,715
they're like, "Dude, look at my bars.

1027
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:42,177
Make the switch. Come on over.

1028
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:46,098
What are you, a fucking Democrat, dude?
Libertarian is where it's at.

1029
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,557
Wake up!

1030
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,976
Join us!"

1031
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,937
When you're with all girls,
they just start...

1032
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:54,273
They constantly fuck with my manhood.

1033
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,276
It's like, I'll come home
and some new thing is painted pink.

1034
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,652
I'm like, "Why is this pink?"

1035
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,780
"It looks better pink, Daddy."

1036
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:03,073
"It looks better pink, Daddy."

1037
00:54:03,157 --> 00:54:04,450
And my wife's like,
"I think they're right."

1038
00:54:04,533 --> 00:54:06,118
I'm like, "Oh...

1039
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,830
I see what the fuck is going on here.
It's mutiny!"

1040
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:12,332
They just chip, chip, chip away.

1041
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,586
It's like if my manhood
was a mountain of marbles.

1042
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,671
Every day they steal two.

1043
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,549
They just walk up to my stack...

1044
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,722
You can't say shit.

1045
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:29,724
You can't say shit,
'cause it's only two marbles,

1046
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:31,435
and you're like,
"I still got all these marbles.

1047
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,104
Everything is gonna be okay.
I'll deal with this eventually."

1048
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,272
But you're not gonna deal with it.

1049
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,483
Every day, two more marbles.
You never get those marbles back.

1050
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:40,527
You see it comin'.
You don't do anything about it.

1051
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,947
You're like, "I gotta go to sleep.
All right, everybody stop crying.

1052
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:44,323
I gotta go to sleep."

1053
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:47,827
And men don't want to admit that.

1054
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,204
"Not me, bro. Not me, bro.

1055
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,956
I'd rather just live
in the woods by myself."

1056
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,541
What are you,
a fucking Coldplay song? Huh?

1057
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,919
What are you, a character in a book,
you piece of shit?

1058
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,254
No one's honest.

1059
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:02,091
No one's honest
about how much we need other people.

1060
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:04,509
That's why the characters
that we adore so much in the movies

1061
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,136
are the people that don't need people.

1062
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,806
The people who just walk away from it all,
like, "Wow, what a rebel!"

1063
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:12,852
But in real life, we need people so bad

1064
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:15,062
that the worst shit
you can do to a prisoner

1065
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,231
is put them in solitary confinement.

1066
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,482
So think about that.

1067
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:22,361
You're in a cement box filled
with rapists and murderers.

1068
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,114
And the worst shit they can do
is leave you alone.

1069
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,616
We're fucking weird.

1070
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,701
We are weird,

1071
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:33,497
'cause what we are really
is we're some weird superorganism

1072
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,500
that, like, needs each other
in some sort of strange way.

1073
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,668
But we're all in denial.
"I'm kind of a loner."

1074
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,170
Oh, shut the fuck up.

1075
00:55:40,254 --> 00:55:42,881
There's no such thing. It's not real.

1076
00:55:42,965 --> 00:55:45,342
Every person in this room,
me included, all of us,

1077
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,219
we are all a calculation.

1078
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,805
We're all an ongoing,
on-running calculation

1079
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:55,310
of all the interactions you've ever had
with all the people that you've ever met.

1080
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:57,229
And you do a bunch of things
that people like,

1081
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,480
and start doing more of that.

1082
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,982
You're like, "I'll do more of that."

1083
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,110
You find things that people don't like,

1084
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,695
you're like,
"I'll keep that shit to myself, hmm.

1085
00:56:06,906 --> 00:56:08,448
I don't like that feeling. Hmm."

1086
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,245
That's what we do.
That's what we do.

1087
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:15,497
It's weird. We don't want to admit it.

1088
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,249
But that's who we all are.

1089
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,920
And I'm just telling you this
because I've never been more of a bitch.

1090
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:26,050
Right now, I have slowly but surely bent
until I'm in this position.

1091
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:29,094
This is how I'm riding out my days,
just like this.

1092
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:32,389
"Okay, okay, okay, okay."

1093
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,476
But I'm also telling you right now
that I'm not going out like Bruce Jenner.

1094
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:40,272
Oh!

1095
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,525
That's right,
politically correct San Francisco.

1096
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:46,653
Here's my take on this Bruce Jenner thing.

1097
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:48,780
And, you know, everybody
has their own... Not really.

1098
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,282
This is what everybody's take is.

1099
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:51,951
This is the take
that you're supposed to have.

1100
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,620
"He's always been a woman trapped
in a man's body."

1101
00:56:54,703 --> 00:56:56,622
Maybe. Definitely maybe.

1102
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:57,914
Definitely people are like that.

1103
00:56:57,998 --> 00:57:01,085
Definitely, there are people
who were born in the wrong gender.

1104
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:03,087
And am I saying
they should stay their gender?

1105
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:04,546
No. Who gives a fuck?

1106
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,006
You should do whatever you wanna do.

1107
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:07,841
You should be happy.
You should be free.

1108
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,259
I don't care what you do.

1109
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:11,720
But...

1110
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,599
it's also possible that, maybe,

1111
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:17,642
if you live with crazy bitches
long enough,

1112
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,311
you become one.

1113
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,604
That's all I'm saying.

1114
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,607
I don't see this discussed.

1115
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,777
It is entirely possible.

1116
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:32,491
If you put a praying mantis on a leaf,
it becomes the color of the leaf.

1117
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,493
Why?

1118
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,078
Because it wants to live.

1119
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,289
It wants to survive.

1120
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,875
It wants to be accepted
by its environment.

1121
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,045
You show me a man who's lived
with the Kardashians for ten years

1122
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,338
who didn't come out a chick,

1123
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,882
and then we'll have some data, okay?

1124
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,426
'Cause right now,
we lost a fucking American Olympian,

1125
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,262
and I want you to have some respect!

1126
00:57:55,639 --> 00:58:00,769
We're down Bruce Jenner.
And I've got a close eye on Kanye West,

1127
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:03,313
and I don't exactly like what I'm seeing.

1128
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,488
Look at Kanye West.

1129
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,574
He's a very talented,
young, heterosexual man

1130
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:16,701
who starts a clothing line...

1131
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,746
he's clearly jealous about Taylor Swift,

1132
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,624
and he tweets like a coked-up stripper
in the middle of the night.

1133
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,210
You don't see what I'm seeing?

1134
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:29,464
We are watching the plot
of a fucking Stephen King book play out!

1135
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:34,678
An American athletic hero moves in
with a woman

1136
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,721
who's made hundreds of millions of dollars

1137
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:39,766
through no way
anyone can explain to anyone.

1138
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:43,770
He breaks up with her.
She turns him into a chick.

1139
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,065
The whole world tells him he's beautiful.

1140
00:58:46,148 --> 00:58:49,318
You tell me you don't see what I'm seeing?

1141
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,284
You have to say...
You have to say she's beautiful.

1142
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,410
"She's beautiful."

1143
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,245
She's not beautiful, and neither am I.

1144
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,372
Look, I look like a thumb
with two thumbs.

1145
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:03,582
Okay?

1146
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,335
You put me in a dress,
I'd be even more disgusting.

1147
00:59:07,336 --> 00:59:08,837
"Beauty's unusual."

1148
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:12,466
There's a lot of cool shit
that isn't beautiful.

1149
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:15,635
Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are
on that list.

1150
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:19,098
Jesus fucking Christ!

1151
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,849
What kind of games are we playing here?

1152
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:23,352
Why are you lying to children?
That's beautiful.

1153
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:26,771
What are my kids gonna think
when they see a mountain or a rose?

1154
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,983
"Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain."

1155
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,318
Ahhh! Bang!

1156
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,153
I can't!

1157
00:59:33,237 --> 00:59:35,655
The world's gone fucking bananas!

1158
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,451
"What you're saying
is horribly transphobic

1159
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:41,203
and incredibly regressive.

1160
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,330
You should be embarrassed
at what you're doing.

1161
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:47,126
You're doing this just to get laughs
at someone else's expense."

1162
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,254
Maybe!

1163
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:56,218
Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons.

1164
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,598
Maybe they waited by the bed...

1165
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,435
until they knew he was
in heavy REM sleep...

1166
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,980
so they could assume their true form.

1167
01:00:12,401 --> 01:00:17,114
Climb up and kick off their designer shoes
to reveal black raven's claws.

1168
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:20,367
Clutched the edge of the bed and just...

1169
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,911
whispered in his ear.

1170
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,330
"Bruce...

1171
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:36,049
we would like you better

1172
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,136
if you were one of us."

1173
01:00:43,807 --> 01:00:46,476
"I can't.

1174
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,813
I can't be one of you.
I was... I was born a man."

1175
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,690
"Nonsense!

1176
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:58,488
Nonsense.

1177
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,534
Bruce...

1178
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,955
you no longer can be held prisoner

1179
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:09,208
by the gender of your birth.

1180
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:11,793
You're free.

1181
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,798
Bruce...

1182
01:01:20,844 --> 01:01:24,889
your lips are too thin...

1183
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:30,312
for the cover of Vanity Fair."

1184
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:34,191
"Huh? What? Wait. Wait.

1185
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:36,693
Did you say the cover?

1186
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:40,197
Okay. Are you fucking with me?

1187
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,990
Because...

1188
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,450
you know the cover's
always been my dream."

1189
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,619
"It can be real!

1190
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:51,375
It can be real.

1191
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,462
All dreams...

1192
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:58,715
can be real through surgery.

1193
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,390
Sleep."

1194
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,108
Thank you very much, San Francisco!

1195
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,361
I had a great fucking time
with you savages!

1196
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,490
Let's take a selfie. Shit. We got it.

1197
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:28,578
Putting together one
of these fucking specials

1198
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,039
is stressful as shit.

1199
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:34,501
I appreciate the fuck out
of all you people being here tonight.

1200
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,379
And I love you guys.
Thank you very much!
