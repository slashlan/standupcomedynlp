1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,480
[male host] Make some noise,
welcome to the stage...

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,720
-Urzila Carlson!
-[audience cheering]

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,520
[rock music plays]

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,520
[cheering continues]

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,480
You guys!

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,880
-See? This is why...
-[cheering softens]

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,760
This is why people love Australia.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,440
'Cause you guys
are just off the fucking nut.

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,400
[audience laughs]

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,120
Just quickly, before we start...
I just-- [laughs]

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,040
I feel like I want to share something
with you.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,560
'Cause sometimes, right,
audiences will send me gifts.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,160
Like, not this audience.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,240
[audience laughs]

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,040
Honestly,
sometimes audiences bring me gifts,

16
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
and then they give it to the usher

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,120
and the usher will bring it backstage

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,680
and then I have to open it.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,000
Because I don't have a crew of people
that travel with me

20
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,240
'cause I'm not Adele.

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,920
[audience laughs]

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,040
You know, I don't know
how people imagine, like...

23
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,720
I walked here tonight.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,880
The five blocks.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,560
[audience laughs]

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,040
You know when you make
that decision, you go,

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,080
"It's only five blocks,
I'm gonna walk it"?

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,840
And then after the third block, you go,

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,960
-"Fuck, I should've taken an Uber."
-[audience laughs]

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,680
Then you go, "It's too late now,
I can't get an Uber now

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,080
for two blocks,
'cause they'll think I'm lazy." [laughs]

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,480
-[audience laughs]
-[chuckles]

33
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,960
You don't want them to give you
a two-star 'cause you're lazy

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,920
'cause then you have to fake a limp
and stuff.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,320
[audience laughs]

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,440
"Yeah, I just sprained my ankle."

37
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,160
So I get this gift, right?
I do a show in Auckland,

38
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,560
and a woman sends a gift with an usher,
and the usher brings it to the room.

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,800
And now I'm gonna open it,
but it looked dodgy as hell.

40
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,640
It was just wrapped in brown paper.

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,480
And-- And it had a string around it,

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000
and not that fancy string
that you get now over Christmas.

43
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,160
You know, you always get--
Like your sister-in-law,

44
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,880
she'll be doing
all this fancy fucking wrapping and shit.

45
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
[audience laughs]

46
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
And you go, "Okay, calm down.

47
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,160
We know it's bath salts."

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,120
[audience laughs]

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
It's like, "Christ, you just spent $45

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,360
on the wrapping of a $2 fucking gift.

51
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
[audience laughs]

52
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,240
And we don't have a bath!"

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,840
[laughing continues]

54
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Not one of those strings,
it was just an old shoelace.

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,560
[audience laughs]

56
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
So you know it's dodgy

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,520
when the usher
sort of kicks the door open,

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,280
throws the gift and goes,
"That came for you," and runs away.

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
[audience laughs]

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,440
So I look at this gift and I shook it

61
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,160
and no powder fell out of it
and it wasn't ticking.

62
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
-[audience chuckles]
-I'm gonna open it.

63
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,320
So I open the gift.

64
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,240
And someone had sent me a moon cup.

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,280
[audience oohs]

66
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,520
Like, a new one, but a moon cup.

67
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,760
Now, for those of you who don't know
what a moon cup is,

68
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,320
ladies, if I can ask you

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,680
to just turn to the men in your area...

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,640
-[audience laughing]
-...and just explain to them

71
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,280
what a moon cup is so I don't have to.

72
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,840
Talk amongst yourselves.

73
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,880
[audience murmuring]

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,280
If you don't know,
ask the people behind you. They know.

75
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,560
[audience laughs]

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,560
Oh, I don't know what's going on there.

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
-There's a lady in the back doing that...
-[audience roars]

78
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,400
I don't know
what you're explaining... [chuckles]

79
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,680
-....but I think you're doing it wrong.
-[audience laughs]

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,320
For those of you who don't know

81
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,040
what a moon cup is, it's basically
a Tupperware bowl for your coochacha.

82
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
[audience laughs]

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,760
Like, you whip it out
when Aunt Flo comes to visit.

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
You feel?

85
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,960
But I knew.
As soon as I received this gift,

86
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,720
I knew I was in deep trouble

87
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
'cause I've got an inquiring mind...

88
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,440
-[audience laughs]
-...and I knew I was going to try it.

89
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,480
[audience laughs]

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,280
[chuckles] Now, I'm not going to go
into detail,

91
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,720
but let me just tell you, it's not for me.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,480
[audience laughs]

93
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,240
Let's just say...

94
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,920
Okay, you know when you're unpacking
the dishwasher, right?

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Ladies, if you want to turn to the men
in your area

96
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,000
-and just explain what I mean. [laughs]
-[audience laughs and applauds]

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,400
No, you know
when you're unpacking the dishwasher

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,000
and you get to the kids' plastic bowls
and cups

99
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,320
and you don't take the time
to individually dry each and every cup?

100
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,760
You just kind of grab them,
whack them and stack them away

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,960
and then tomorrow morning,

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,480
you have to feed those same children
out of those bowls

103
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,040
and you take it out and you're like...

104
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,280
[audience laughs]

105
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,760
Yeah, that.

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,680
[audience roars]

107
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,200
So, no, it's not for me.

108
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,600
[audience laughs]

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,760
I travel a lot.

110
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,040
I'm on the road
about 300 days of the year,

111
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
and whenever I do go back home
to Auckland,

112
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,560
I always go see my GP

113
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
and get them to do the once-over.

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
Right, give it everything.

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,920
Like, from head to toe,
from head lice to ingrown toenails

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,760
-and everything in between.
-[audience laughs]

117
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,840
They check the boobs, the smear.

118
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,120
They even give you the flu jab,
you know, 'cause science.

119
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,880
-Um...
-[audience laughs]

120
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,120
I'm not going to tell you what to do
with your life,

121
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
you know, I'm just saying.

122
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,880
We vaccinate
'cause we understand words and shit.

123
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,960
[audience laughs]

124
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,760
-[chuckles]
-[audience cheers and applauds]

125
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,120
Now, I understand that there might be
some anti-vaxxers here tonight.

126
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,760
'Cause when I did the show in Auckland,
13 people got up and walked out...

127
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,920
-[audience laughs]
-...and the whole auditorium went...

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,800
[cheers, laughs]

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,480
Like I was supposed to fight them
or something. I'm like,

130
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,680
"Leave them alone,
they've got sick kids at home."

131
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
[audience roars]

132
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,960
So, anyway, I go in, I see my doctor.
She does what she can do

133
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,880
and then she sends me off to the nurse.

134
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,400
Now, our nurse, Nurse Barb,
retired two years ago.

135
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
Which is a good thing

136
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,760
because she was, like, two years younger
than Jesus, okay?

137
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
-[audience laughs]
-I'm not ageist.

138
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,480
But the last two years,
I also got a prostate check.

139
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,000
[audience laughs]

140
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,480
I didn't hate it.

141
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,600
[audience laughs]

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
That's why I went back
the second year. [chuckles]

143
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,000
[laughing continues]

144
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,040
Anyway, I walk in,
we've got a brand new nurse,

145
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
Nurse Maniah,

146
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
and, uh, I look at her and I go, "Hi,"

147
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,040
and she's lovely,
she's a lady in her fifties.

148
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,760
Um... And I look around
and I'm trying to find the gown.

149
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,560
Because you have to put this gown on

150
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,320
with an opening in the front

151
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,880
because they're going to be working
on your entertainment area...

152
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,200
-[audience laughs]
-...right?

153
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,920
Now, personally...

154
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,320
I'm not a big fan of the gowns

155
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,240
because they never close properly.

156
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,680
You know, 'cause I've had
a few big Christmases in my time.

157
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,800
[audience laughs]

158
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,720
Like, I don't identify as fat.

159
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,040
But I've definitely, you know...

160
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,840
I'm-- I'm quite a few meals ahead
and a few shits behind, so...

161
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,320
[audience laughs]

162
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,680
[women cackling]

163
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,760
And, you know,
you don't need to be a personal trainer...

164
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,720
to know that if those two things
don't line up,

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,480
-you can never be your goal weight.
-[audience laughs]

166
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,040
But I don't see the gown,

167
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
and Nurse Maniah goes,
"No, no, I use a lavalava."

168
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,120
And I thought, "This is great,
it's basically like a sarong.

169
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,400
Not only do I get a smear

170
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,360
but I also get a cultural experience.

171
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,320
I love it."

172
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
[audience laughs]

173
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
So I take the lavalava off her,

174
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,000
and now I wait for her to leave
and close the curtain

175
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,760
so I can, you know,
take my kit off and put it on.

176
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
So she closes the curtain.

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,800
But she stays in there with me.

178
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,360
[audience laughs]

179
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,760
So at this point...

180
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,520
I decide to decline the lavalava.

181
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,560
She then takes it
and biffs it on the desk,

182
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,960
and I take my kit off
and I hop on the table.

183
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Now,
the protocol when going for a smear

184
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,520
is you, the patient,

185
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,800
must stare at the wall.

186
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,800
[audience laughs]

187
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,080
And her, the nurse,

188
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,840
must stare at a speck on the curtain
over here.

189
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,000
[laughing continues]

190
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,040
But never...

191
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,040
do you make eye contact.

192
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,440
[audience laughs]

193
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,000
So, she starts,

194
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,600
and I can feel her rummaging around.

195
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,840
[audience laughs]

196
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,360
Which is not what you want
to feel at a doctor's surgery,

197
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,560
you want a... you want a confident hand.

198
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,760
-[audience laughs]
-You want--

199
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,000
You want someone that knows
what's going on.

200
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,400
And I could feel her rummaging around,

201
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,280
and I don't know at what point...

202
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,320
do I act?

203
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,040
At what point should I go,

204
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,680
"Do you need help?"

205
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,680
[audience laughs]

206
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,160
[laughing] Too awkward, right?

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,320
Or do I just keep quiet
and guide her hand in?

208
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,400
[audience laughs]

209
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,800
Yeah, you're right,
that would be too much.

210
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,160
-[mumbles]
-[audience laughs]

211
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,120
I didn't have to do either of those things

212
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,880
because she asked me something
that was so left field

213
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,880
that it knocked me,
I had to think about it for a second.

214
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
She goes, "You still a virgin?"

215
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,520
[audience roars]

216
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,640
[laughs] And I went...

217
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,640
[audience laughs]

218
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
"Say what, now?"

219
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,880
I was like, "Oh... Oh, no.

220
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,800
I've had the sex heaps."

221
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,600
[audience laughs]

222
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,640
And she goes, "Huh.

223
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Okay."

224
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,840
She then leaves the room.

225
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,240
At this point...

226
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm regretting not taking that lavalava.

227
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,520
[audience laughs]

228
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,360
'Cause now I'm just lying on that bed

229
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,360
like a frozen supermarket chicken...

230
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,120
[audience laughs];

231
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,880
-[breathing shakily]
-[laughing continues]

232
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
...worried that someone might come in.

233
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,120
They didn't. She came back in a flash.
She had a smaller speculum.

234
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,240
[audience laughs]

235
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,760
And she was at it again and she goes,

236
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,400
"I'm just gonna ask you again."

237
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,240
She goes,
"You sure you've had sex before?"

238
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
I go, "Yeah!"

239
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,240
I said, "I'm married,
my wife's waiting in the waiting room."

240
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,400
-She goes, "Oh...
-[audience laughs]

241
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,280
...I see." [chuckles] She goes...

242
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,440
[dramatically] "But have you had sex
with a man?"

243
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,480
I said, "Yes, I'm familiar
with disappointment."

244
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,400
[audience laughs]

245
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,960
[audience applauds]

246
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,400
She says, "I'm just asking

247
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,040
'cause you've got the smallest vagina

248
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,080
I've ever worked with in my career."

249
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,440
I went, "No shit!"

250
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,960
I guided her hand in,
she took the swab.

251
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,960
I got dressed, I went in the waiting room
and I go, "Come, babe!"

252
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,400
To my wife, not to a stranger.

253
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
-I go, "Come."
-[audience laughs]

254
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,640
We walk back in.

255
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I said, "Nurse Maniah's got something
to tell you about my... [clicks tongue]

256
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,720
[audience laughs]

257
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,400
-...entertainment area." [laughs]
-[laughing continues]

258
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,240
Nurse Maniah looks at her, she goes,

259
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,640
"If I had to describe her vagina
with one word,

260
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
I'd say... petite."

261
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
[audience laughs]

262
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,800
My wife immediately turns to me
and she goes,

263
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,480
"You cannot use this story on stage."

264
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,240
[audience laughs]

265
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
-I said, "Bitch...
-[audience applauds]

266
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,760
...a medical professional just told me
something on me is petite.

267
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,280
-I'm fucking telling everyone!"
-[audience laughs and applauds]

268
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,600
[audience cheering and whistling]

269
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,280
But that explains the moon cup,
doesn't it?

270
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,800
[audience laughs]

271
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,720
-I needed a thimble. [laughs]
-[laughing continues]

272
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,000
So this show is called Loser

273
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
and I decided to write the show
'cause I was so...

274
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,160
confused, like it's always negative
if you lose anything.

275
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,200
You lose your keys,
you lose your mind, you lose your dad:

276
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
that's negative.

277
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,800
But you lose a bit of weight:

278
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,720
positive.

279
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,640
-[audience laughs]
-And I don't understand that.

280
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,120
Like, if you lose half a kilo,

281
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,840
strangers will applaud that.

282
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,400
You can go out right now and go,
"I lost half a kilo,"

283
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,240
people will go, "Good on you,"
and give you a high five.

284
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,440
Which I don't understand.

285
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,720
If you truly love someone--
If you love someone, don't you go,

286
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,080
"I fucking love you so much,
I wish there were 50 kilos more of you"?

287
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,240
[audience laughs]

288
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,840
With everything else,
if you love it, you want more.

289
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,040
You love cake? Fucking give me more cake.

290
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,280
[audience laughs]

291
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
-Or you love money? Give me more money.
-[laughing continues]

292
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,280
I fucking love you? Less of that.

293
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
[audience laughs]

294
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,000
It makes no sense.

295
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,480
Now, I know...
I know I need to lose some weight.

296
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,400
I know that.

297
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,840
But I-- I want to be very careful.

298
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,480
I just want to lose enough weight

299
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,600
so I can eat in public.

300
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,080
[audience laughs]

301
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,760
I just want to be able
to eat a pie in public.

302
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,960
-[laughing continues]
-'Cause you know if you're in here

303
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,320
and you're a bit of a chub,

304
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,640
-you know you cannot eat in public.
-[audience laughs]

305
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,600
You will be judged, right? Like--

306
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,640
Even if it's a celebratory pie.

307
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,120
-[audience laughs]
-Even-- [laughs]

308
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,000
Even if your stomach stapling
has been really successful...

309
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,440
[audience laughs]

310
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,080
...and to celebrate,
you go to BP to get a pie

311
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,040
'cause they've got the best pies.

312
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,640
That's what their name is for.

313
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,160
[audience laughs, applauds]

314
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,760
[women cheer]

315
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,600
You go over there,

316
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,840
you grab a pie

317
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,640
and you're outside eating that pie,

318
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,440
like, "Nom-nom, 80 kilos gone."

319
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,320
You know some fuckwit in a ute
will drive past

320
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,960
-and go, "Who ate all the pies?" [cackles]
-[audience laughs]

321
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,480
And you have to go...

322
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,440
-[timidly] "I did."
-[audience laughs]

323
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So I know I have to lose some weight.

324
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,680
But I want to be careful
'cause I don't want to lose too much

325
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
and end up in porn.

326
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,840
[audience laughs]

327
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,600
'Cause you know
that is a very real possibility.

328
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,640
[audience laughs]

329
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,600
If you're hot.

330
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,440
if you're super...
Like you are, you're proper hot. Right?

331
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,600
Like, you're a beautiful couple.

332
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,040
Do you work out together?

333
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
-Yeah.
-Of course you do.

334
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,800
[audience laughs]

335
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,480
I'm not fit-shaming you.

336
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,720
But you're a hot couple.

337
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,120
Like, aesthetically,
you're quite pleasing to the eye.

338
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,560
[audience laughs]

339
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,000
Like, if you two came up to me in a bar

340
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,320
-and asked me for a threesome, I'd be in.
-[audience laughs]

341
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,240
Yeah.

342
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,520
And not just
in a "hold the camera" kind of way.

343
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
I'd give it my all.

344
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
-[audience laughs]
-[chuckles]

345
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,680
I would get so freaky,

346
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,480
you two would be super impressed.

347
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,880
Like, halfway through,

348
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,080
over my naked butt, you'd just be
high fiving each other, going...

349
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,200
[audience laughs]

350
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,120
"Fucking score on this one, eh?"

351
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,280
[laughing continues]

352
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,720
But you have to be careful.

353
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,960
'Cause you're beautiful,
you could end up in porn.

354
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,440
The rest of you, you're fine.

355
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,280
[audience laughs]

356
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,200
'Cause, you know, if you're in a happy,
healthy relationship

357
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,600
and you've got a healthy sex life,

358
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,880
at some point,

359
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,160
one of you will turn to the other and go,

360
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,720
"We should record ourselves.

361
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,720
[audience laughs]

362
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,520
You know, while we're... [clicks tongue]

363
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,440
You know?"

364
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,840
And you will.

365
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,640
If you're going, "We'll never do that,"

366
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,840
your partner's probably already doing it.

367
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,280
[audience laughs]

368
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,640
You may as well get involved.

369
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,200
There's a whole genre of porn
of you not being in porn.

370
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,120
-So you might as well.
-[audience laughs]

371
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,960
And then you're going to go, "Okay, fine."

372
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,200
Then you've got to take your smartphone,
you'll prop it up somewhere in the room.

373
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
And then you go at it.

374
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,960
You go at it hammer and tongs, right?

375
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,440
You give it your A-game

376
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,680
'cause you know you're recording yourself.

377
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,920
[audience laughs]

378
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,680
Then afterwards you go,

379
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,720
"Okay, go get it."

380
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,360
[audience laughs]

381
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,880
He rolls off you, he goes and he gets it.

382
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,280
He comes back and you're excited.
You're like... [giggles]

383
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,720
[audience laughs]

384
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,440
"Oh, this is going to be good.

385
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,240
This is going to be great, yeah.

386
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,440
[blows kiss]

387
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,080
-[audience laughs]
-I love you."

388
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,800
And you hit play.

389
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,440
-[dry-heaving and gagging]
-[audience laughs]

390
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,240
[loudly] "Why is my arsehole so dark?

391
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,000
[audience roars]

392
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,160
Why is it so hairy?

393
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,480
[audience laughs]

394
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,480
It looks like
a tarantula is crawling out of a cave."

395
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,800
-[laughing continues]
-[gags]

396
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,120
You look at your body at an angle

397
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
you wouldn't normally see,

398
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,320
performing an activity
you wouldn't normally see

399
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,360
reflect back in a shopfront window.

400
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,600
[audience laughs]

401
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,120
You see things on your body

402
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,760
that you wouldn't normally see.

403
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,840
You look at that and you go...

404
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,520
[yelling] "Is that a nipple on my back?"

405
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,240
[audience laughs]

406
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,080
And your partner's, like, super blasé
He goes, "Yeah.

407
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,040
[audience laughs]

408
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,160
I thought you knew."

409
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,680
You're like, "No, every time it's cold,

410
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,960
I think it's the fucking label
on my cardigan!"

411
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,560
[audience laughs]

412
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,800
And he's like, "No, no.

413
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,480
And when it's really hot, it does
that weird Barbie mouth thing, that..."

414
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,520
[audience laughs]

415
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,920
You look at that footage,
it's not natural.

416
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,200
It's your fat, pasty-ass white body

417
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,000
-plowing at pace...
-[audience laughing]

418
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,720
...into another fat,
pasty-ass white body...

419
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,360
meeting abruptly in the middle.

420
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,280
It doesn't even sound good.

421
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,840
[audience laughs]

422
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,800
Like, in the heat of the moment,
you don't hear anything.

423
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,040
But when it's silent

424
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,120
and you're just staring
at your white body with an extra nipple

425
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
on a little screen,

426
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,800
all you can hear... [smacking rapidly]

427
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,960
[audience laughs]

428
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,640
Like, "What is that noise?

429
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,160
-Oh, it's your balls on my tummy."
-[laughing continues]

430
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,080
You look at that and you go,

431
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,280
"Why am I fucking you?

432
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,520
[audience laughs]

433
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,120
Why are you fucking me?

434
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
Let's never do this shit again."

435
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,520
[audience laughs]

436
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
Then you go, "Delete it."

437
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,840
[audience laughs]

438
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,280
And he goes, "I will."

439
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,080
"No, you're fucking doing it now!"

440
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,640
-[audience laughs]
-[hisses]

441
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,480
He deletes it.

442
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,200
You double-check it's deleted
out of the recently deleted.

443
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,480
[audience laughs]

444
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,720
That couple then take that phone together,

445
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,680
walk it out to the shed,

446
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,520
-take a hammer...
-[audience laughs]

447
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,560
...smash it till there's only powder left,

448
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,560
take a brush,

449
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,720
into a little plastic bag.

450
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,080
[laughing continues]

451
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,520
You drive from the top of the country

452
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,360
to the bottom of the country
and at every public toilet, you stop

453
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,560
and you put some of that dust

454
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,520
-in the toilet...
-[audience laughing]

455
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,200
and then you flush it

456
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,200
just in case some IT genius
is about to crawl out of his mother...

457
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,040
to put that shit back together again
and share it with the world.

458
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,160
We are very careful.

459
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,400
[quietly] But you two...

460
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,720
[audience laughs]

461
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,240
Not you two.

462
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,880
[audience laughs]

463
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,720
You're like,
"Yeah, let's record ourselves."

464
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,680
"Yes, let's.

465
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,880
Let's. Just let me finish moisturizing."

466
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,480
[audience laughs]

467
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,680
[clicks tongue] And then you
prop the phone up,

468
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,120
and afterwards you go, "Go get it,"

469
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,880
and he's like, "Yeah, no worries."

470
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,840
-[exhales sharply]
-[audience laughs]

471
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,920
Don't even need to get out of the bed

472
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,120
'cause that yoga is finally paying off.

473
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,680
[audience laughs]

474
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,920
Actually, that hurt my back.
[pained] I don't think I...

475
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,440
-[audience laughs]
-[laughs]

476
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,200
Medic! [giggles]

477
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,280
You take that phone.

478
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,640
Like, "Let's have a look at this.

479
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,720
Oh, this is gonna be good.

480
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,080
[audience laughs]

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,480
[puckers] I love me."

482
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,320
[audience laughs]

483
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,960
You hit play on that.
You're like, "Oh...

484
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,200
[sexually] Oh, yeah, look at that!

485
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,600
Look at that!"

486
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,040
Like, "Holy shit.

487
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,840
I'm glad we went for that
two-for-one anal bleaching.

488
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,760
[audience laughs]

489
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
[gruff] We look amazing!

490
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,480
We should get a blue light,
let it light up."

491
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,800
[giggles]

492
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,000
"This is phenomenal work.

493
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,680
Yeah, wait, wait,
my best part's coming up.

494
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,920
The dismount.

495
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,320
[audience laughs]

496
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,720
You go into a full triple back flip..."

497
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm not very good at sports talk,
you know.

498
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,640
[audience laughs]

499
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,320
"Full splits onto my dick.

500
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,040
-This is lovely."
-[laughing continues]

501
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,440
You go... [laughs] You go, "Save that.

502
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,680
Save that. We look phenomenal."

503
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,320
You go, "Let's watch it tomorrow
when we get back from pilates."

504
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,960
-[audience laughs]
-[sighs]

505
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,560
Tomorrow night, you get back from pilates.

506
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,920
-You're like... [gruff] "Oh, yeah.
-[audience laughs]

507
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,240
You know how I get all limber
and into it.

508
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Now, let's watch it."
So you watch it again. You go,

509
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,040
"Fuck, we are beautiful.

510
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,360
[audience laughs]

511
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,680
We'll save it. [exhales]

512
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,920
We'll watch it tomorrow night
after my spinning class.

513
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,960
[audience laughs]

514
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,960
You know how I get after spinning class.
[exhales sharply]

515
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,680
When my perineum is still vibrating."

516
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,440
[audience laughs]

517
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,720
I assume that's what happens,
I don't know. [chuckles]

518
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,360
[audience laughs]

519
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,760
I don't ride a bike.
I'm an adult, I've got a car. [inhales]

520
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,800
[audience roars]

521
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,040
-[laughs]
-[audience applauds]

522
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,320
And then you watch it again
and you go,

523
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,200
"You know, we are so beautiful.

524
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,680
It'll be a waste
if only we get to see it.

525
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,080
[audience laughs]

526
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,760
We should upload it."

527
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,680
Then you load it up to Pornhub

528
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,880
and we're now all whacking off
to you two...

529
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,280
[laughing continues]

530
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,120
...'cause we're no longer fucking
each other.

531
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,040
[audience laughs]

532
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,560
So all I'm saying is get ugly or get fat,
or you're going to be in porn.;

533
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,320
[audience laughs]

534
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,360
You know your dad's going to find it.

535
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,600
[audience oohs, laughs]

536
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,160
Yeah.

537
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,960
Your mum won't know
what's going on. [laughs]

538
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,240
You know... [chuckles]

539
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,920
You have not lived as an adult

540
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,120
if you haven't been at your parents' house
on a Sunday

541
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,040
waiting for the roast,
your mum's in the kitchen

542
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,080
you're watching some trash with your dad,

543
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,120
and then your mum
just pops out of the kitchen going, "Hey!

544
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,400
Can you have a look at the computer?
It's wiped the history again."

545
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,040
[audience laughs]

546
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,480
And you look at your dad
and you go, "Motherfucker!

547
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,160
[audience roars]

548
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,880
Can't remember your Facebook login

549
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
but know how to wipe the history,
do ya?" [laughs]

550
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,560
[laughing continues]

551
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,960
And your dad's like, "Oh, it's all right,
I'll have a look later."

552
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,080
-I bet you fucking will. [laughs]
-[audience laughing]

553
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,240
So anyway, what I'm saying
is I need to lose some weight.

554
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,200
[audience laughs]

555
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,240
I'm already panicked.

556
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,280
Because I'm of the size,

557
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,120
whenever they talk on the news
about the obesity epidemic in Australia,

558
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,120
I know I could be one of those arses
walking in the street.

559
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,560
[audience laughs]

560
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,080
You know the one. When as soon
as they start talking, they go,

561
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,680
"We've got a dietician here. Um...

562
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,000
The obesity epidemic in Australia..."

563
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,800
And you're like, "Oh, no. No, no, no.
Where did they film today?"

564
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,920
-And when you...
-[audience laughing]

565
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,080
When you see they're in an area
where you were,

566
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,160
-you're like... [yelling] "No!
-[audience laughs]

567
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
Oh, fuck off!"

568
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,520
[laughing continues]

569
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,040
'Cause, you know, it's always you
in your track pants. [laughs]

570
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
[audience laughs]

571
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,240
I see those fat people walk
with these short steps like this.

572
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm like, "What the fuck are you doing?

573
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,960
Stride it out, motherfucker! "

574
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,600
[audience laughs]

575
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,840
Have you guys ever watched
that show The Biggest Loser?

576
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,280
[all] Yes.

577
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,760
You know when they came up
with the concept for that show,

578
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,440
there wasn't a fat person
in a ten-kilometer radius.

579
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,280
Because it would've been
a completely different show.

580
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,880
When they came up with the concept,
they were all sitting in a boardroom

581
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,280
in their yoga pants,

582
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,800
and they go,
"All right, we've got $200 million.

583
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,960
What are we doing?"

584
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,040
And Karen in Marketing went, "Well...

585
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,160
-how about we take 12 fat people...
-[audience laughs]

586
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,000
...and we put them
in this fat farm scenario,

587
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,080
and then we give them, like,
six carrot sticks a day to eat...

588
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,440
[laughing continues]

589
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,240
...and we give them
these really angry personal trainers."

590
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,440
Like you get them any other way.

591
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,840
"We give them
these really angry personal trainers

592
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,680
to yell at them all day
and make them exercise

593
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,440
-and then vomit up those carrot sticks."
-[audience laughs]

594
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,120
And everyone's like, "All right.

595
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,040
All right."

596
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,280
Even if there was a fatty
in the room at this point,

597
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,360
they'll go, "Harsh. But watchable."

598
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,920
[audience laughs]

599
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
[laughing] You've watched it.

600
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,200
And then they go,
"Okay, Karen, then what?"

601
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,680
"Well,
then we just monitor their progress.

602
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,960
So once a week,
we just put them on some scales

603
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,520
in their cute little outfits.

604
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,320
And then behind them,

605
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,560
in giant red LED lights

606
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,720
that they can't see,

607
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,680
we put the weight they used to be,

608
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,360
their weight now, their BMI,
and their sperm count.

609
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,120
[audience laughs]

610
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,920
And then we judge them like that."

611
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,480
Now, if there was a fatty in the room,

612
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,320
they'd go,
"Hang the fuck on," at this point.

613
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,840
They'd go,
"Just a minute, just a fucking minute.

614
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,960
[audience laughs]

615
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,720
What are these cute little outfits
you're talking about?"

616
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,360
[audience roars]

617
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,960
She goes, "Oh.

618
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,520
I thought, like, bike pants
and sports bra?"

619
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,480
"No."

620
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,040
'Cause you know what,
if you're over the age of two...

621
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,640
[audience laughs]

622
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,720
-...you don't look cute or good in 'em.
-[laughing continues]

623
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,840
The only people allowed to wear bike pants
and a sports bra

624
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,720
are people under the age of two

625
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,960
-or if you're in the Olympics.
-[audience laughs]

626
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,840
That's it.
Tomorrow morning, if you wake up

627
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,240
and you're putting those bike pants on,
go, "Am I over the age of two?"

628
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,480
[audience laughs]

629
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,520
If the answer is yes,
then ask yourself,

630
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,880
-"Am I in the Olympics?"
-[audience laughs]

631
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,640
If the answer is no,
get the fuck out of those pants.

632
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,840
[audience laughs, applauds]

633
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,840
[chuckles]

634
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,160
'Cause you know what the problem is
with that outfit,

635
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,280
especially for women of a certain age.

636
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,040
Like, I'm in my mid-forties.

637
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,680
You know what the hardest thing
of my day is?

638
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,120
Lining up my nipples.

639
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,960
[audience laughs]

640
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,440
I wake up every morning

641
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,600
and when I put a bra on,

642
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,400
it's like doing
two really complex Rubik's cubes.

643
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,200
[audience laughing]

644
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,680
-Oh, fuck it. Tuck it into your pants.
-[audience laughs]

645
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,560
Well, Karen,
you can't tuck it into your pants

646
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,800
when you're not fucking having
anything in the middle.

647
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,480
It'll look like a fleshy scarf.

648
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,160
[audience laughs]

649
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Fat people don't like to get weighed.

650
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,560
That's why we don't skydive.

651
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,600
[audience laughing]

652
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,560
Well, that, and it scares the shit

653
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,120
out of whoever has to do
a tandem jump with you.

654
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,880
[audience laughs]

655
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,960
But... [chuckles]

656
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,800
When you skydive, they weigh you.

657
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,000
And then they write
your weight on your hand

658
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,320
-with a permanent marker.
-[audience laughs]

659
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,480
I don't want to be telling people
three days after my jump,

660
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,880
"Oh.

661
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Oh, no, it's not a phone number."

662
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,640
[audience roars]

663
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,280
If I was in charge
of making The Biggest Loser,

664
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,840
it would look completely different.

665
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,080
For starters,
the people I would put in there.

666
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,600
I'd put people in The Biggest Loser,

667
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,600
those people who never say thank you
for shit.

668
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,640
Like when you're driving
and you give someone a gap

669
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,320
and usually it takes a few goes

670
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,720
to try and get them in the hole.
You're like...

671
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,400
[audience laughs]

672
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,200
And then they take it...

673
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,440
and you wait for it.

674
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,160
[audience laughs]

675
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,120
But they just keep going.

676
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,640
It's like they take that gap
and go, "Mine!"

677
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,440
[audience laughs]

678
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,800
What kind of animal raised you...

679
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,360
[audience laughing]

680
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,480
...that you would take a gap
and not just put your hand up like that

681
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,960
to thank the person behind you?

682
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,400
That's all you have to do.

683
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,960
'Cause if you don't thank
the person behind you,

684
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,080
you're making it unsafe on our roads.

685
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,800
[audience laughs]

686
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,680
'Cause now
I have to aggressively overtake you...

687
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,520
[laughing continues]

688
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,120
...to go get my good deed back

689
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,000
'cause you were raised by an animal.

690
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,920
[audience laughs]

691
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,080
It's the same as when you're driving

692
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,040
and there's a pedestrian crossing
and you stop and a car there stops,

693
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,320
and then the pedestrian walks past
and they thank this guy

694
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,480
and just walk past your car,

695
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,520
and you're like...

696
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,320
[audience chuckling]

697
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,160
"What's going on here?

698
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
[audience laughs]

699
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,800
I'm doing what they're doing.

700
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,840
Where's my thank you?"

701
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,360
I reckon if they're two thirds
past your car

702
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,000
and they haven't started
lifting their arm, hit them with your car.

703
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,000
[audience roars]

704
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
[woman cheers]

705
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,800
Not to kill 'em.

706
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,160
Just to knock 'em down
so you can talk to 'em.

707
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,120
[audience laughs]

708
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,680
Then you hop out of your car and go,

709
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,560
"Don't worry, I've got this.
I'm a medical professional.

710
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,120
I've got a petite vagina."

711
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,360
-[audience laughs]
-[laughs]

712
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,200
You go, "Where's my thank you, asshole?"

713
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,080
-[laughs]
-[audience laughs]

714
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,000
Those people are all going
on my Biggest Loser campl

715
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,560
Or when you're at work, right,
and you're in the lunchroom,

716
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,240
you just want to eat your sandwich
in peace. And then you hear it...

717
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,400
-[slurping aggressively]
-[audience oohs]

718
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,320
And you look over and there he is.

719
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,760
You go, "Jesus, Brian.

720
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,840
[audience laughs]

721
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,600
How about you just leave
that cup of tea for a minute?

722
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,480
That's going to cool down
to a temperature...

723
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,480
where you can just go ahead
and drink it.

724
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,760
[audience laughs]

725
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,920
Where it won't sound like you lost

726
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,400
-your top lip in a violent accident.
-[laughing continues]

727
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,240
And now you're curving your bottom lip
in a straw-like scenario,

728
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,040
trying to suck a teabag out
of the bottom of that cup."

729
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,240
[audience laughs]

730
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Brian's going in The Biggest Loser camp.

731
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,880
[audience laughs, oohs]

732
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,480
Or that friend that we all have

733
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,520
that have never let you finish a sentence.

734
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,720
You've been friends for years

735
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
and this is the only thing
they've ever seen out of you.

736
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,280
-[stammers hesitantly]
-[audience laughs]

737
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,160
Fucking Biggest Loser camp.

738
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,600
Or any right-wing politician
that has ever said

739
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,920
anything so fucking stupid,
it makes you want to headbutt a nail.

740
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,320
[audience laughs]

741
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,080
They're going in there. You know the ones.

742
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,400
Like-- Like those people
that can't even take

743
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,640
a mild egg to the head
without trying to knock out a teenager.

744
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,200
[audience cheers and laughs]

745
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,600
[audience applauds and whistles]

746
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,920
Get in the camp.

747
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,520
Then what we do
is we give them challenges

748
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,720
that they cannot achieve,

749
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,200
like keeping a cookie
out of a fat kid's hand.

750
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,960
[audience laughs]

751
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,600
If they fail, we give 'em paper cuts.

752
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,480
[audience laughs]

753
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,520
Now, I wasn't raised by an animal,
I understand that,

754
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,240
you know, everyone's not the same.

755
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,360
Like, the tea slurper
is not on the same level

756
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,120
as the right-wing politician.

757
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,840
So we cut them
with different grades of paper.

758
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,760
[audience laughs]

759
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,760
The tea slurpers and the interrupters,

760
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,680
they get 150 gsm.

761
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,160
[audience laughs]

762
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,200
Then the people
who don't thank you in traffic

763
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,080
who have no manners,
they get a 300 gsm gloss.

764
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,200
[audience laughs]

765
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,000
And the right-wing politicians,

766
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,480
we cut them with X-rays.

767
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,400
-[exhales sharply]
-[audience laughs]

768
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,400
And then we take chili oil
and rub it in their wounds. [laughs]

769
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,640
[audience oohs, laughs]

770
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,360
-I know, I've got a lot of time to think.
-[laughing continues]

771
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,320
That's what I do
when you guys are at the gym. [chuckles]

772
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,160
People go, "Why don't fat people
just get off their fucking arses?"

773
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,360
-'Cause we're thinking of this shit.
-[audience laughs]

774
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,240
Okay, maybe that's a little extreme.

775
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,520
Maybe it's more like... I just think,
like, other things are bigger losers--

776
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,280
Other people are bigger losers

777
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,480
than actual fat people just losing weight.

778
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,000
Like, say if you get in a car
with your friend, right?

779
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,360
They're driving.
You're saying to that friend,

780
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,080
"I trust you

781
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,280
with the most important thing
that I have:

782
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,640
my life."

783
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,000
'Cause without it,
you can't do shit, right?

784
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,160
[audience laughs]

785
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,800
So you start driving,

786
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,560
and 'cause you live in Melbourne,
it starts to rain.

787
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,520
[audience laughs]

788
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,480
They don't turn the wipers on.

789
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,600
You know? All right. All right.

790
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,400
I'm not going to be that person,
but you know

791
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,160
how vitally important it is
for you, the passenger,

792
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,080
to see where they're driving.

793
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,800
[audience laughs]

794
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,120
Otherwise how do you know
how to make the right... [inhales sharply]

795
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,040
[audience laughs]

796
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,080
You don't want to say anything.

797
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,520
So you just start scooching down
in your seat a little.

798
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,920
-[audience laughs]
-Just a little.

799
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,600
'Cause just above the dash,
just under the wipers,

800
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,320
there's always a weird half moon

801
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,160
-that you can see out of.
-[audience laughs]

802
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,600
But then you start to panic, right,

803
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,720
and you think about that pillow
that your wife bought

804
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,440
about you living your best life.

805
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,800
And you think, "Fuck,
I do want to live my best life

806
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,560
and I want to continue with that.

807
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,840
I should say something."

808
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,160
[yelling] "Put the wipers on!"

809
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,840
[audience laughs]

810
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,160
And they go, "Oh, shit,
I didn't even notice it started raining."

811
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,240
[audience laughs]

812
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,240
"You know you're driving, right?"

813
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,920
[laughing continues]

814
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,520
And then because it's Melbourne,

815
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,400
five minutes later it stops raining.

816
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,440
[audience chuckles]

817
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,120
-[squeaks]
-[audience laughs]

818
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,400
[squeaks]

819
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,160
They don't turn the wipers off.

820
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,760
Not only do they visually have something
in front of their eyes going,

821
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,520
"Oh, you're fucking up here, mate..."

822
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,000
-[giggles]
-[audience laughs]

823
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,680
...audibly,
there's a bit of a soundtrack, too.

824
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,960
It gets so dry

825
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,720
that it does that weird triple jump
in front of you.

826
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,840
-[audience laughs]
-When it comes back, it's like...

00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
-[thumping]
-[laughing continues]

828
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,120
You're not safe.

829
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,560
You need to undo your belt,

830
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,120
-open the door and tuck and roll. Just...
-[audience laughs]

831
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,920
Those people are bigger losers
than you. [laughs]

832
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,040
But, you know,
because we have social media,

833
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,960
we put ourselves into situations
where you feel like a loser.

834
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,240
'Cause you look
at other people's amazing lives, right,

835
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,040
'cause they have these amazing filters

836
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,600
and amazing bullshit on their pages

837
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,400
that you start to believe,

838
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,520
'cause even though,

839
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,320
intellectually, you know it's bullshit,

840
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
you know this person,
they have a horrible life.

841
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,520
But your eyes go,
"It's better than yours."

842
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,840
-[audience laughs]
-And then you feel like a loser.

843
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,880
But it's not. It's like if you show up

844
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,000
20 minutes early to a party,

845
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,320
you're not a loser.

846
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,360
You're smart.

847
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,640
-'Cause they usually have the food out.
-[audience laughs]

848
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,840
They have the food out

849
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,440
and they're still doing the setup.

850
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,360
So you can get involved.

851
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,240
You go, "No, you carry on,
don't worry about me."

852
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,000
You look at their table,

853
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,480
-you go, "Guacamole looks good." [laughs]
-[audience laughs]

854
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,720
"I'm going to give it a go.

855
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,960
-[audience laughs]
-Just going to try it for her.

856
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,440
Give her some valuable feedback
if she needs it."

857
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,640
So you grab a chip.

858
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,440
Now, you're not a fool.

859
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,680
You know to go in slow, right? [laughs]

860
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
[audience laughs]

861
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,040
-You've been around food before. [laughs]
-[audience laughs]

862
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Don't worry.

863
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,720
When that chip breaks...

864
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,080
[audience laughs]

865
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,600
you're so disappointed in yourself,

866
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,360
you're like, "How am I this age

867
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,840
-and I can't nail a snack?"
-[audience laughs]

868
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,360
'Cause now you know you're in deep shit.

869
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,760
You better get that chip out
before she comes out.

870
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,320
Don't want to fuck up the table

871
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,920
before anyone else gets there.

872
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,760
You're gonna take another chip.

873
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,000
But you're gonna take a strong one.
You know, the...

874
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,320
[audience laughs]

875
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,840
No, 'cause you know the ones
that are curved,

876
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:14,880
the curved ones are structurally stronger
than the others.

877
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,280
[audience laughs]

878
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
So, you take that curve. Also, pro-tip:

879
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,360
they always have more flavor
'cause they're sort of...

880
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
Anyway, so...

881
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,920
[audience laughs]

882
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,440
So you take that chip.

883
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,200
Now, you know, you're not a fool.

884
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,800
You're gonna go low and slow.

885
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,160
You're gonna go low and slow,

886
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,760
and you want to slowly curve it
around the original chip.

887
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,200
Just make it a little...
You don't want to go too close

888
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,280
'cause then it could
structurally damage the...

889
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,280
So, you just want to go... slight--

890
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,360
When that second chip breaks...

891
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,840
[audience laughs]

892
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,880
...you question every decision
you've ever made as an adult.

893
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,600
"I should probably not be alone."

894
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,520
[audience laughs]

895
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,040
'Cause now you know you'd better
get that out before she comes out.

896
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,720
You've got two chips in there.

897
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,320
You're not gonna take another chip,
you're not an idiot.

898
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,320
[audience laughs]

899
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,680
You're going to learn
from your mistakes here.

900
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:10,200
You don't want her to come out
to two half dead chips in the guacamole

901
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,920
-with a fucking moat around it.
-[audience laughs]

902
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,200
[laughing continues]

903
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,440
-[thumps]
-[audience laughs]

904
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,840
When you're second knuckle in,

905
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,800
she comes out and busts you.

906
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,360
[audience laughs]

907
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
Like you're at your high school dance...

908
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,200
and you just lock eyes
with each other. [laughs]

909
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,600
[audience laughs]

910
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,040
-[laughs, snorts]
-[audience laughing]

911
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,880
-I love that slow realization.
-[laughing continues]

912
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,920
-Ooh... [laughs]
-[audience laughs]

913
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,240
-My hand's still in the guacamole.
-[audience laughs]

914
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,640
She walks out, she locks eyes with you.

915
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,760
She looks at you, you look at her.

916
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,640
She knows your hand's in the guacamole,

917
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
you know your hand's in the guacamole.

918
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,920
You look at each other,
'cause you don't know at what point...

919
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,160
should you pull your hand out.

920
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,400
[audience laughs]

921
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,760
There's no time like the present
so you just pull it out.

922
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,240
Now the bigger conundrum.

923
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,720
Do you flick it or lick it?

924
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,360
[audience roars]

925
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,720
She just stares at you,
never breaking eye contact

926
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,280
looking over to you,
just taking the bowl, going,

927
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,960
-"I wasn't that happy with it anyway."
-[audience laughs]

928
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:32,080
She walks in the kitchen,
you  can hear her throw it in the sink.

929
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,040
You feel like such a loser
'cause you go,

930
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,440
"It's out of season for avos,
that would've cost her $400."

931
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,680
[audience laughs]

932
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,560
You're not a loser,
but what you didn't realize

933
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,080
that if you normally show up
20 minutes late,

934
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,560
the guacamole's been sitting
on the table for 40 minutes

935
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,640
slowly getting to room temperature,

936
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,000
and then it's smooth as anything.

937
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,160
You can fucking lift it

938
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,200
-with anything out of that bowl.
-[audience laughs]

939
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,960
You can lift it with hopes
and dreams into your mouth.

940
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,200
[audience laughs]

941
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,560
You don't know that
because you're not a chef.

942
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,800
Neither am I, but I'm an enthusiast.

943
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,120
[audience laughs]

944
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,320
You're not a loser

945
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
if you say "no, thanks" to free stuff.

946
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,160
I say "no, thanks"
to free stuff all the time

947
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,920
but now because we live in a time

948
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,920
where there are people who are influencers

949
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,200
and that is a job that just involves
getting free shit all day,

950
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,640
it's unheard of
when someone approaches you

951
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,120
and goes, "You want something free?"
and you go, "No, thanks."

952
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,120
Unless it's a flyer or something.
You're like, "No." [stammers]

953
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,600
But I get offered stuff all the time
and I go, "No, thanks."

954
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,120
And especially when I get on a plane,

955
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
they always go,
"Do you want the exit row?"

956
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,320
Never business.

957
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,480
Always the exit row.

958
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,000
I go, "No, thanks."

959
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,040
[audience laughs]

960
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,120
People-- Ten people back will go,

961
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,640
[aggressively] "Did she just say no
to the exit row?"

962
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,880
They're so angry when I go, "No."

963
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,560
I go, "Yeah, I don't need it."

964
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,760
I'm five foot three.

965
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,560
My knees have never touched another seat.

966
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,240
[audience laughs]

967
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,760
'Cause I'm mainly torso, too.

968
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,800
[audience laughs]

969
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,640
Some airlines,
my feet don't touch the ground.

970
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,200
[audience laughs]

971
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,680
Give it to someone that needs it.

972
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,880
I don't feel I'm trained enough
to sit there anyway.

973
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,560
I don't know
where these air whores go to air school,

974
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,200
but I haven't been.

975
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,480
[audience laughs]

976
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,680
I don't think it's enough

977
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,200
when they come up to you
before the flight and they go,

978
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:26,000
"Um... Did you read the A4 laminate?"

979
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,360
[audience laughs]

980
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,080
And I go, "No, I didn't
because it's pictures on there.

981
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,680
[audience laughs]

982
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,080
And you don't read a picture,
you look at it.

983
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,600
So am I now more trained than you?

984
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,720
[audience laughs]

985
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,560
Am I in charge of this flight?

986
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,720
I'm just here for the snacks, mate.

987
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,560
You can... You can put me near the toilet,
I don't care."

988
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
You're not a loser.

989
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,920
You're not a loser if you wake up
seven o'clock one morning and you go,

990
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,840
"Hmm.

991
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,200
Today's a shit day."

992
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,280
[audience laughs]

993
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,280
Well, you know yourself,

994
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,600
you don't need to live the whole day
to know it's gonna be a shit one

995
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,160
-[audience laughs]
-Sometimes you know

996
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,400
before you open your eyes,

997
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,480
-you're like, "Yeah, today's a shit one."
-[audience laughs]

998
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,400
If you open your eyes
seven o'clock in the morning

999
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,960
and you go, "Fuck it.
I'm getting blackout drunk by three..."

1000
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,640
[audience laughs]

1001
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,680
...then do it.

1002
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,800
Do it, it's called self-care.

1003
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,280
-Look after yourself.
-[audience laughs]

1004
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,120
Obviously, if that's a decision

1005
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,640
you've been making for the last 15 years
every morning... [clicks cheek]

1006
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,840
...you've got a problem.

1007
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,000
[audience laughs]

1008
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,960
But if you do it once every 18 months
to two years and go, "Today's that day,"

1009
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:36,880
do it.

1010
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,880
Why is it socially acceptable

1011
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,280
to start drinking at noon
but not at 7:00 a.m.?

1012
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,840
[audience laughs]

1013
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,920
Like, if a friend rings you at 7:00 a.m.,

1014
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
which would be weird,
but if they ring and they go,

1015
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,200
"Hey, what are you up to?"

1016
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,480
"I just poured myself a wine."

1017
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,240
[audience laughs]

1018
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,720
They'll think you've lost your mind.

1019
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,440
But that same friend can ring you at noon
and go, "Hey, what are you up to?"

1020
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,200
"Oh. Just poured myself a wine."

1021
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,440
They go,
"Well, I guess it's noon somewhere."

1022
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,120
You go, "It's noon here, Cara."

1023
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,360
[audience laughs]

1024
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,920
I don't know why we put
that amount of stress on ourselves

1025
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,800
because of a few fucking hours.

1026
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,040
Like, the amount of times I've woken up

1027
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,560
and I've taken that box wine

1028
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,720
and I've put it on the kitchen counter...

1029
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,040
-[audience laughs]
-...and I just look at it, and I'm like,

1030
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,160
"Should I take the tap out
and let it breathe or...?"

1031
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,680
[audience laughs]

1032
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,400
'Cause that's always the hardest thing
with a box wine.

1033
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,960
You have to get the cover off
and then you have to get that tap,

1034
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,560
and it's always real in the box.
It's like...

1035
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,080
You have to put your hand in so deep,

1036
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,680
I feel like I'm working on a dairy farm.
Like... [struggles]

1037
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,920
[audience laughs]

1038
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,360
"I can feel a hoof!"

1039
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,800
You get that tap out.

1040
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,800
A hundred percent of the time,
the hole always faces there.

1041
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,760
[audience laughs]

1042
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,400
You have to pull the whole sack open,

1043
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,560
sort of slowly get the tap down.

1044
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,920
I feel I lost some of you
as soon as I said "box wine." [laughs]

1045
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,240
[audience laughs]

1046
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,800
You go, "Fucking box wine?"

1047
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,440
[laughing continues]

1048
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,920
[laughs] I don't care where you are
in your life right now financially,

1049
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,840
but at some point,

1050
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,240
every single one of us drank box wine.

1051
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,120
-[audience laughs]
-Yeah.

1052
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,000
[audience cheers and applauds]

1053
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,840
Maybe some of you are like,
[formally] "I have never."

1054
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,040
-[chuckling smugly]
-[audience laughing]

1055
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,640
Yes, you have!

1056
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,400
If you've got bogan friends,
you've had box wine.

1057
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,360
-[audience laughs]
-[laughs]

1058
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,040
I love entertaining, right?

1059
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,160
I have people over to my house
all the time.

1060
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,000
And then when they go,
"What should we bring?"

1061
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,320
I always go,
"Just your good self, doll."

1062
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,800
And then what I do
is I wash the labels off old wine bottles,

1063
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
and then I fill it with box wine.

1064
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,160
[audience laughs]

1065
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,960
[chuckles] And not to worry,

1066
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,800
I'll even mix you a rosé.

1067
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,680
[audience laughs]

1068
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,360
I do the whole shebang, right?
[laughs] So...

1069
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,720
Not once in all these years

1070
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,440
have anyone during dinner gone,

1071
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,480
"Excuse me.

1072
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,800
What fresh hell
are we drinking here tonight?"

1073
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,200
[audience laughs]

1074
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,320
No, they usually go,

1075
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,640
"Mm! Where did you get this one?"

1076
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,920
And I always go, "On my travels."

1077
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,880
-[audience laughs]
-And they assume...

1078
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,520
around the world.

1079
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,120
But just to the liquor store.

1080
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,880
[audience laughs]

1081
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,520
I mean, they know the next morning.

1082
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,800
Because you know
the next morning after... [laughs]

1083
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,720
...a box wine, that hangover
is completely fucking different

1084
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,960
-to a good wine hangover.
-[audience laughs]

1085
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,040
You wake up after a good wine,

1086
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:33,920
right, and you have that hangover,
you wake up, you're like, "Woo!

1087
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,160
Oh, that Central Otago 2009, that...

1088
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,520
-[audience laughs]
-...that pinot noir nutty goodness

1089
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,560
is going to come back and bite me
at around 3:30. [laughs heartily]

1090
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,760
-[audience laughing]
-[hearty laughing continues]

1091
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,360
But you know with box wine,

1092
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,440
you open your eyes, you're like, "Woo!

1093
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,680
[audience laughs]

1094
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:57,080
Satan fucked my skull last night.

1095
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,240
[audience roars, applauds]

1096
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,240
And he's got a giant penis."

1097
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,240
-[chuckles]
-[audience laughs]

1098
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,440
You're not a loser.

1099
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,080
Drinking box wine is good
for the whole family.

1100
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,840
When you're finished,
you whip the box off,

1101
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,960
you give that to the cat,

1102
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,920
he plays with that.

1103
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,320
You blow up the bag
and the kids play with that.

1104
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,840
-You're fucking mother of the year.
-[audience laughs]

1105
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,160
-[audience applauds]
-Yeah.

1106
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,680
You're not a loser...

1107
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,640
if after you've been to your mum's house,

1108
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,600
maybe you've had a massive feed,

1109
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,960
you've had seconds,
she's given you dessert.

1110
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,280
She's even given you some leftovers
in a little plastic bag

1111
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,840
because she doesn't trust you
with her Tupperware.

1112
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,120
-[audience laughs]
-[chuckles]

1113
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,600
Now you have to drive

1114
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,160
with a plastic bag of spaghetti
next to you.

1115
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,280
-[audience laughs]
-[giggles]

1116
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,880
"Fuck, I hope I'm not in an accident.

1117
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,520
This is going to be hard to explain."

1118
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,520
-[laughing]
-[audience laughs]

1119
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:01,320
You're full, and then you drive
to the hardware store quickly

1120
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,040
'cause you need a new tool belt.

1121
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,680
[audience laughs]

1122
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,400
-[sighs, laughs]
-[audience laughs]

1123
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,520
As soon as you get out of the car,
you smell it.

1124
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,800
You smell that sausage sizzle.
You're like, "Yeah."

1125
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,600
When you get on a plane, right,

1126
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,520
you're not hungry,
you just had a nine-course dégustation.

1127
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,840
You're chockers. You go, "I'm so full."

1128
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,400
But as soon as you hear
the wheels on the food cart,

1129
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,800
-you panic!
-[audience laughs]

1130
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,880
You panic, you're like,
[yelling] "Chicken! Oh."

1131
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,720
[audience laughs]

1132
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,000
That's what it's like
when you get out of your car

1133
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,120
at the hardware store, you're like...
[sniffs]

1134
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,520
[longingly] "Yes."

1135
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Like, you're not there for the cuisine.

1136
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,520
-[audience laughs]
-Let's not fuck around.

1137
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,000
That's not good food.

1138
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,120
You know those sausages
are basically vegan.

1139
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,440
[audience laughs]

1140
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,520
They're made from wood chip
and goat spit...

1141
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,800
-[audience laughing]
-...and the goat donated the spit.

1142
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,600
He just looked at that and went... [spits]
"I'm not eating that."

1143
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,360
[audience laughs]

1144
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,720
But it's because there's so much joy
around there.

1145
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,600
As soon as you get it,
you look at those people

1146
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,640
and they're always happy,
'cause it takes a certain personality

1147
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,240
to go there every week
and fucking turn sausages.

1148
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,680
[audience laughs]

1149
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,120
You look at them, they're like...

1150
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,280
[laughing continues]

1151
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,120
[sighs] I want to be around that joy.

1152
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,080
You rummage around the car
for a gold coin,

1153
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,040
you walk up to them,
you give them a gold coin

1154
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,080
and then you... [thumps]

1155
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,080
...pop out your hand.

1156
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,440
There are very few instances

1157
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,680
where you as an adult
can go up to another adult,

1158
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,040
put out your hand and go,

1159
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,280
"Put food on that.

1160
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,920
[audience laughs]

1161
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,760
I've already got a bag of spaghetti
in the car."

1162
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,880
[laughing continues]

1163
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:42,960
They then take a napkin,

1164
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
put that in your hand, and then they put

1165
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,800
the thinnest white bread
you've ever seen in your life

1166
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,520
on top of that.
We call it magic bread at my house

1167
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,600
'cause it's impossible
to put any spread on it.

1168
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,400
-[audience laughs]
-You can try.

1169
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,760
But as soon as you do... [thumps]

1170
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,560
-...the middle's gone.
-[audience laughs]

1171
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,600
You can't even find it in the house.
It's just gone.

1172
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,720
You just have this weird frame
of what bread used to be.

1173
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,040
[audience laughs]

1174
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,480
So you've got your napkin.

1175
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,680
They put the magic bread,
then they put some onion,

1176
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,640
some fried-up onion,

1177
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,160
and then they put the sausage,

1178
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,160
and then... [sputters]

1179
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,840
...tomato sauce
over the top of that.

1180
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,400
It's never-been-near-a-tomato sauce,

1181
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,360
let's be fair,
that shit glows in the dark.

1182
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,640
[audience laughs]

1183
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:25,160
Now you've got your food in your hand.
Now, pro-tip: What you want to do

1184
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,160
is you want to go ahead and curve it.

1185
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,800
-[audience laughs]
-You want to curve that whole scenario

1186
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,960
like this, 'cause if you keep it flat,
it's very hard to eat.

1187
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,720
[audience laughs]

1188
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,440
If you keep it flat,
it's called a situation.

1189
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:41,800
[audience laughs]

1190
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,160
But the minute you roll it,
you've got a meal.

1191
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,600
[laughing continues]

1192
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,720
Now you walk into the hardware store

1193
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,000
and you look for other people like you.

1194
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,840
You look for the other sausage people.

1195
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
When you see them,
you're like... [exhales in relief]

1196
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,640
[audience laughs]

1197
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,320
[inhales] "We make the same decisions.

1198
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,520
[audience laughs]

1199
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,240
We're here... [laughs]

1200
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,880
-...and we both have these. Yeah.
-[audience laughs]

1201
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,440
On your... No, tool belt.
Tool belt, I mean."

1202
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,120
[audience laughs]

1203
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,280
Then you start eating

1204
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,680
and something magical happens

1205
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,960
as soon as you walk away
from that barbecue.

1206
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,040
The onion is now freezing cold.

1207
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,840
-[audience laughs]
-But the sausage will increase in heat.

1208
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,200
-There's...
-[audience laughs]

1209
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,640
I think it's the glue
that holds it together.

1210
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:30,920
[audience laughs]

1211
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,200
So you want to approach that sucker
with caution when you eat.

1212
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,560
You approach with your teeth,
like a hot potato,

1213
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,200
so you can breathe through the back of it.

1214
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,960
Like, get some air on that thing.

1215
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,280
-[audience laughs]
-[sucks in air, exhales sharply]

1216
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,160
It's a very toothy approach,

1217
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,640
like your first blowjob.

1218
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,800
[audience laughs]

1219
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,280
You walk through the shop,
you're about halfway through.

1220
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,520
You look and you go,
"Fuck, I'm eating the napkin too."

1221
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,320
[audience laughs]

1222
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,440
You're not a loser,
that's where the nutrients lie.

1223
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,040
[audience laughs]

1224
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,280
[chuckling] But then...

1225
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,600
we do start... Do we have a snorter?

1226
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,720
That's great!

1227
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:16,840
[audience laughs]

1228
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,200
I love how everyone's,
"It's this lady here."

1229
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,440
-[laughing continues]
-[laughs] It's like...

1230
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,120
-It's not like she had a shit on the seat.
-[audience laughs]

1231
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,240
I'll just get some water.

1232
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,120
I'll just be walking over here,
getting some of this every now and again.

1233
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,560
You know, whenever I take a sip like that,
the wardrobe lady is downstairs going...

1234
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,640
-[muttering softly]
-[audience laughs]

1235
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,360
...just in case I spill some of this water
down my tits.

1236
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,560
[audience laughs]

1237
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,720
'Cause if you know me,

1238
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,280
there's a hundred percent chance
that I can do that.

1239
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
This wasn't the top
that I was supposed to wear tonight,

1240
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:54,120
but... [sighs]

1241
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,720
...I had a top that matched the pants.

1242
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,960
[audience laughs]

1243
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,400
But it's got about half a liter
of butter chicken on it.

1244
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,880
-[audience roars]
-[chuckles]

1245
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:06,160
So, yeah, decisions were made. [exhales]

1246
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,000
-[audience laughs]
-[laughs]

1247
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,120
I said to them, I go,
"Just let me wear the stained top

1248
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,280
because realistically that's how people
will be seeing me in the future." [laughs]

1249
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,720
[audience laughs]

1250
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,280
It is very rare to see me in the street

1251
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,680
without food somewhere...

1252
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,920
-on the tatas, but, um...
-[audience laughing]

1253
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,560
[clicks tongue] Apparently,
that's a big fucking no-no.

1254
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:27,960
All right, uh... [laughs]

1255
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,080
...here we go.

1256
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,240
Now, there are things that we do

1257
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,440
that we think we're nailing and we're not.

1258
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,120
Like thongs.

1259
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,400
-Jandals.
-[audience chuckles]

1260
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,720
Flip-flops.

1261
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,960
Plakkies.

1262
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,920
That's what we call them in South Africa.

1263
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,600
You know,
we will never have world peace...

1264
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,840
unless we can agree on a name
for these shoes.

1265
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:51,880
[audience laughs]

1266
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,600
Nowhere where you go in the world
are they called the same.

1267
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,560
You could get on a plane right now,
fly somewhere you've never been before,

1268
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,120
get off, go to a shop and go,

1269
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,160
"Excuse me.

1270
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,240
I'm looking for those summer shoes...

1271
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,400
[audience laughs]

1272
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,880
...that you can get your toes through
like that.

1273
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,520
And then, "Oh, you're talking..."
[hoots sharply]

1274
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,280
[audience laughs]

1275
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,960
We don't even question

1276
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,600
why the fuck it's called that.

1277
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,800
We just go, "Yeah.

1278
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,600
I was hoping to buy some blue..."

1279
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,560
-[whines sharply]
-[audience laughs]

1280
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
Now, the thing with those shoes,

1281
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,840
they don't come with instructions,

1282
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,720
-and the thing is, they really should.
-[audience chuckles]

1283
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,960
'Cause I never owned a pair of those
'cause I grew up on a farm in South Africa

1284
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,320
where we have snakes
and scorpions and shit.

1285
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,320
So, you can't have any of that.

1286
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,200
So the first time
I ever bought a pair of those

1287
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,680
was when I was in my mid-thirties,

1288
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,880
thirteen years ago in New Zealand.

1289
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,680
And no one stopped me.

1290
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,960
Like, I bought them,
no one, as I got to the door, went, "Hey.

1291
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,360
Have you used those before?"

1292
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,480
[audience laughs]

1293
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,120
You go, "No, I haven't."

1294
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,120
"Come here.

1295
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,720
Hey, just so you know...

1296
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:03,680
if a drop of moisture gets on the inside
of that shoe... [chuckles]

1297
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,800
...you're dead.

1298
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,320
[audience laughs]

1299
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,440
Oh, and if a drop of moisture

1300
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,600
gets on the outside
of that shoe... [chuckles]

1301
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,920
...you're dead.

1302
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,120
[audience laughs]

1303
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,640
Oh, and don't think for a second

1304
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,080
that you can run...

1305
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,480
[audience laughing]

1306
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,840
...from your car...

1307
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,080
during a thunderstorm...

1308
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,560
[audience laughs]

1309
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,800
...into the mall...

1310
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:30,440
where they've gone ahead and tiled it.

1311
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,880
[audience laughs]

1312
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,240
'Cause whether you're physically prepared
or not,

1313
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,480
you're gonna do the full fucking splits."

1314
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,760
[audience laughs]

1315
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,600
You're like, "Oh, okay, cool.

1316
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:43,680
Cool, cool, cool, cool...

1317
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,000
Cool."

1318
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,240
As you walk out, they go,
"Oh, one more thing.

1319
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,960
Just so you know,

1320
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,840
those shoes? [laughs]

1321
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,800
They're only for forward motion.

1322
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,640
[audience laughs]

1323
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,440
-We call them one-directional. [chuckles]
-[audience laughs]

1324
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,360
Yeah.
Oh, you want to take a step to the side?

1325
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,080
-[laughing] You're dead.
-[audience laughs]

1326
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,440
You want to take a step back?

1327
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,440
My uncle tried that. He's dead."

1328
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,880
[laughing continues]

1329
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,560
Those shoes are so complex, man.

1330
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,080
They should come with a warning
and someone to live with you

1331
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,040
for, like, a week after you buy them.

1332
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:16,800
I bought a pair,

1333
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,480
my wife and I took our two kids
down to Fielding, where she's from.

1334
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,200
It's a small farming community
in the middle of the North Island

1335
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,640
-of New Zealand.
-[man cheers]

1336
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,880
It's not as exciting
as that person makes it out to be.

1337
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,480
[audience laughs]

1338
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:30,920
Like, nothing happens there

1339
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,760
every half an hour
and it usually lasts about an hour.

1340
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,720
[audience laughs]

1341
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,840
So we took our kids
and we showed them around a bit

1342
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,880
and then after two minutes,
we were done and, uh...

1343
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,000
[audience laughing]

1344
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:45,600
I... I went and strapped my two-year-old
back into the car,

1345
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,480
you know, his little vaccinated arse
back into the car seat.

1346
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,840
[audience laughs]

1347
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,920
And I forgot

1348
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,720
that I was wearing these death booties,
right?

1349
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,240
So you know the movement
after you strap them in,

1350
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,640
you have to take a side step
so you can close the door

1351
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,280
'cause they're too weak
to pull the door shut, aren't they?

1352
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:03,200
[audience chuckles]

1353
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,920
But as soon as I took that side step,
my body just went,

1354
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,160
"Okay, we're gonna go ahead and, uh...

1355
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,480
[audience laughing]

1356
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,560
...go ahead and put you down
at this point.

1357
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,080
-[audience laughs]
-Uh...

1358
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,400
You're gonna go on your ass."

1359
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,800
And my brain just went,
"I... I can't stop this. You, uh...

1360
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,600
-[audience laughs]
-You are on your own."

1361
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,760
I was falling down so slowly

1362
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:25,680
that I had time to move shit
out of this pocket

1363
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,760
-to this pocket.
-[audience laughing]

1364
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,280
I could move my handbag over

1365
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:32,680
and I was just walking it out.

1366
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,080
Just walking it out.

1367
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,000
I fell over so slowly, my wife had time
to walk around the car, look at me and go,

1368
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,640
-"What are you doing?"
-[audience laughs]

1369
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,120
I said, "I'm falling over."

1370
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,560
[audience laughs]

1371
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,840
She took out her phone,

1372
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,680
took a few photos of me and sent it
to everyone in our WhatsApp group.

1373
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,400
And I learned something valuable that day.

1374
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,440
I learned that I'm officially
at the age-weight ratio

1375
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,000
where I no longer fall over.

1376
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,480
[audience laughs]

1377
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,160
I had a fall.

1378
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,920
[audience laughs]

1379
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,120
You don't know when it will happen to you.

1380
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,960
Even five years ago,
my friends would have gone,

1381
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,880
-"Were you drunk?" [snickers]
-[audience laughs]

1382
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,160
Now I get all these concerned emojis
and...

1383
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,520
[audience laughing]

1384
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,360
"Mate, are you all right?
I believe you had a fall."

1385
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,120
-I'm like...
-[laughing continues]

1386
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,760
"No, bitch,
I was wearing my death booties.

1387
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,920
I forgot."

1388
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,320
The other thing
that we think we're nailing

1389
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,600
and we're fucking not,

1390
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,920
are puffer jackets.

1391
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,880
-And especially... [laughs]
-[audience laughing]

1392
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,760
...especially Melbourne,
you are so bad for puffer jackets.

1393
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,880
You know, today,
I would classify today's weather as mild.

1394
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,920
Like, if you were one of those people
that can feel the chill,

1395
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,320
maybe a long-sleeved T-shirt is for you.

1396
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,520
-[audience laughs]
-You know what I saw today?

1397
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:52,240
Two ladies walked past me
and both of them had those puffer jackets

1398
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,280
that come down to mid-calf.

1399
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,200
-Zipped up.
-[audience laughs]

1400
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,360
I mean, that is a bold fucking statement

1401
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,560
if you zip it up.

1402
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,000
Sometimes you go,
"Look, I had it at work,

1403
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,080
my hands are full
so now I'm carrying it home

1404
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,480
and it's open so I still get a breeze on."

1405
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:09,960
When you zip it up,
you're saying to people,

1406
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,360
"I'm fucking cold."

1407
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,360
[audience laughs]

1408
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,360
But I looked at those women and I thought,

1409
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:17,400
"What have you heard?"

1410
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,160
I mean, honestly,
wouldn't it just be spectacular

1411
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,520
come three o'clock... [puffs air]

1412
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,160
...massive storm,
we're up to our earlobes in snow.

1413
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:26,360
[audience laughs]

1414
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,200
And just these two bitches going,

1415
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,320
"Fucking knew it."

1416
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,640
[audience laughs, applauds]

1417
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,280
They designed those jackets

1418
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,960
so people in Antarctica
don't freeze to death.

1419
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,120
Like, if you've got
a colleague who's a sherpa,

1420
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,480
-you need to get one of those.
-[audience laughs]

1421
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,360
But if you've got a colleague named Brian

1422
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,920
who can't cope
with a cup of fucking tea, you're fine.

1423
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:48,920
[audience laughs]

1424
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,960
Light layering is in your future.

1425
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,760
Get a cardigan and a scarf.

1426
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,920
You're fine.

1427
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,680
So confusing when I come here

1428
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,200
'cause I always fly into Australia
then go straight to the hotel.

1429
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,560
It's all air conditioned.

1430
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,800
And then at some point, I go,

1431
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,520
"I should go for a walk, I wonder
what's happening with the weather."

1432
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,720
And then you look out the window
at the people in the street and you go,

1433
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,320
"Yeah.

1434
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,600
[audience chuckles]

1435
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,720
It's impossible to tell."

1436
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,240
[audience laughs]

1437
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,560
'Cause two thirds of you
are wearing puffer jackets

1438
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:21,160
with shorts and death booties!

1439
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,160
[audience laughs and applauds]

1440
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,440
I don't know what's going on.
We preparing for snow or backyard cricket?

1441
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,080
[audience laughs]

1442
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,760
You know,
we all do stupid shit on a daily basis.

1443
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,000
That doesn't make you a loser.

1444
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:37,040
Just 'cause you're having a tough time
in your life doesn't make you a loser.

1445
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,360
I think the only true losers
in our society

1446
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,360
are those people who go online
and attack people

1447
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,000
for shit that they cannot help.

1448
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,320
Like, if you've ever gone online
and attacked someone

1449
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,200
for the way they look,
what the fuck is wrong with you?

1450
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,120
Like--

1451
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,560
During the Olympics, right,

1452
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,600
a woman won a gold medal.

1453
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,720
I read the article, good on her.

1454
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:59,560
And then I had a brain fart
and I clicked on the comments section.

1455
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:00,520
[audience laughs]

1456
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,600
If you want to lose hope in humanity,

1457
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,520
click on the comments section
of your newspaper

1458
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,040
and just read that.
The very first comment said,

1459
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,560
"Yeah, good on her, but what a dog."

1460
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,920
[audience oohs]

1461
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,600
I clicked on this man's profile
and I thought,

1462
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,320
"He's no oil painting.

1463
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,080
[audience laughs]

1464
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,560
Unless someone smudged him at birth."

1465
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,560
-[audience laughs]
-Like--

1466
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,440
The confidence you'd need to rock...

1467
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,320
If you're gonna attack someone
for their looks,

1468
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,400
-you'd better be fucking hot.
-[audience laughs]

1469
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,000
Not even average looking.

1470
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,040
-Fucking smoking hot.
-[audience laughs]

1471
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,960
'Cause then if you click on their profile,
"Yeah, all right, fair call."

1472
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,640
[audience laughs]

1473
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,120
But I don't understand
attacking someone for their looks

1474
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,200
because it's not like she made herself.

1475
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,200
Like, if we made ourselves,
we'd be stunning.

1476
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,880
I would be so beautiful,
you wouldn't be able to look at me.

1477
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,280
[audience laughs]

1478
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,280
I wouldn't need to be
introduced by anyone.

1479
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,680
You'd know I'm coming

1480
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,080
'cause you're coming.

1481
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,800
[audience laughs]

1482
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,720
Yeah.

1483
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,240
[audience applauds]

1484
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,120
He's going,
"Oh, she's coming 'cause I'm coming!"

1485
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,880
[laughing and applause continues]

1486
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,040
[man cheers]

1487
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,280
If you truly have a problem
with the way someone looks,

1488
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,080
look up their dad on Facebook and go,

1489
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,480
"Hey, bro, what happened?"

1490
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,240
[audience laughs]

1491
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,080
Or attacking someone for their sexuality.

1492
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:21,560
'Cause you know that's not a choice.

1493
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,320
Oh, God. You know that's not a choice?

1494
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,160
-[audience laughs]
-[chuckles]

1495
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,040
I thought,
"Fuck me, this is the audience...

1496
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,160
-[laughs]
-[audience laughs]

1497
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,280
This is the audience
that's gonna break me,"

1498
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,600
like, "It is a choice.

1499
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,320
[audience laughs]

1500
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,840
We're here from the Baptist Church
and, uh...

1501
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,760
[laughing continues]

1502
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,560
...we believe it is a choice

1503
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,560
and you've been making
the wrong choice." [laughs]

1504
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,840
-[audience laughs]
-"We're here to put hands on you."

1505
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,760
[laughing]

1506
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,240
You know it's not a choice.
Sexuality is not a choice.

1507
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,760
If it was a choice, there wouldn't be
a straight woman alive.

1508
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,160
[audience laughs, applauds]

1509
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,520
Like, no offense to men.

1510
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,880
No offense to men, I love you guys,

1511
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,520
but have you seen your balls?

1512
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,760
-[audience roars]
-[laughs]

1513
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,000
Those aren't your biggest asset. [laughs]

1514
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,320
[audience laughing]

1515
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,120
[chuckling] They're an acquired taste.

1516
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,640
[audience laughs]

1517
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,600
I reckon the first-- If it was a choice,
if sexuality was a choice,

1518
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,760
the first time a woman walks into her room

1519
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,840
where there's a naked man,
she'd go "Oh.

1520
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,920
[audience laughs]

1521
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,240
Oh...

1522
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:31,440
Oh... [stammers]

1523
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,800
-Uh... [exhales slowly]
-[laughing continues]

1524
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:37,520
I'm gonna go look for some puss. Uh...

1525
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,520
[audience laughs]

1526
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,960
I'm gonna leave you with that."

1527
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,120
[audience laughs]

1528
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,640
Do you know how hard it is to explain

1529
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,240
what balls look like
to a gold-star lesbian?

1530
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,440
[audience laughs]

1531
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,560
Do you guys know what a gold star is?

1532
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,640
-[woman cheers]
-Okay, a gold star

1533
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:56,520
is a gay person who has never slept
with anyone from the opposite sex.

1534
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,760
They only sleep with their own kind,
the way God would want it.

00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,800
[audience laughs]

1537
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:08,640
So-- Oh, wait, actually,

1538
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,880
gay dudes can be platinum stars.

1539
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:15,040
They are ones that have never slept
with anyone from the opposite sex

1540
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,120
and they were born via cesarean.

1541
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,760
[audience laughs]

1542
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:26,080
So, even on the day they came out,
they had a look

1543
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,520
and went, "Fuck no!

1544
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,400

1545
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:35,560
-Take me out through the sunroof!"

1547
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,720
So...

1548
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,480
Do you know how hard it is for me

1549
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,280
to explain to a gold-star lesbian
what balls look like?

1550
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,760
'Cause I've seen a fair few
in my fucking time.

1551
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:52,880
-[audience laughs]
-I go,

1552
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,160
"Well, basically, it's like... [stammers]

It's like...

1556
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,560
two rotten kiwi fruit...

1557

-[audience laughing]

1558
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,640
...had a baby with some old tea bags

1559
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:10,520
and they just keep getting longer
and longer and longer.

1560
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,400
You guys have been amazing!

1561
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:15,240
-Thank you so much for having me.
