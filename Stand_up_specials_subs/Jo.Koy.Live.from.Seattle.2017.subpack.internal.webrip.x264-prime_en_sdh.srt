Every color.

That's what I love about Seattle.

When I first moved out here...
Like, when I was living out here,

28
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:41,226
this is where the Indian casinos
started opening.

29
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:47,065
Like Muckleshoot. Remember that?
Is that still around?

30
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,651
- [crowd] Yeah!
- Muckleshoot?

31
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,614
But when an Asian says it,
it sounds more Asian than Indian.

32
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:55,577
[Asian accent]
"Muckleshoot. You want to play...

You go to the Indian reservation.
I've never seen any Indians.

36
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,723
There's more... I don't see any.
It's just all Vietnamese people and...

37
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,100
Chinese people.

38
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:29,775
That's all. I want to see an Indian.
One. Just one. Give me one Indian.

39
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,819
I want to see Pocahontas.
Just one Pocahontas.

40
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:37,115
Just give me an Indian lady.
One Indian lady.

41
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,994
I swear to God, if I find her, it's over.

42
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:46,958
It's over. I want a hot Indian wife,
and I'll marry her,

00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,627
and I'll have ten kids with her,

I love watching...
When women laugh, it's my favorite.

49
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,145
Because when women laugh,
they laugh hard.

50
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,898
They don't give a shit.

51
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,776
If it's funny, they're, like,
"Oh, my God. Right?

52
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,697
Ten Indians. And then he'll count,
like the fucking song!

[sobbing]
Hilarious!"

55
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:28,083
Women will laugh... Look.
Women will laugh and cry.

56
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:33,171
Women will laugh and cry
because they're emotional creatures.

57
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,341
They can't give you one emotion.
"I gotta give you two!

Ha ha ha! Are you serious?
Are you happy?

[cries]

62
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,314
And they do this shit. What is that?

63
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:56,987
Because they're crying,
and that's their way of drying the tears.

64
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,407
Fanning tears. That's fucking water!

65
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,285
You can't fan water!

66
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:07,205
You don't get out of the shower and go,
"Oh, my God, that shower was amazing.

67
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,710
Oh, my God! I'm gonna be late!"

68
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:23,305
Women will laugh and pee.
They don't give a shit.

69
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:28,059
In public. In public!
In front of their friends.

70
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,537
They don't give a shit.
They'll tell their friends,

71
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,272
"He's funny, right?"
"I know. I just peed a little.

00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,108
I swear to God."
"A little? Bitch, that's a lot."

00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:39,738
"I don't give a fuck.
It's funny. It's funny."

74
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,867
And I love it when women laugh

75
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,912
and they threaten
that they want you to stop,

76
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:49,623
and if you don't, they're gonna pee.
They threaten you.

00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:54,211
"Stop. No, seriously, stop!
I swear to God, I'm gonna pee!

Where's the hand? Look at her!
And then look at her crotch. Piss.

She just pissed.
You got that on tape, right?

Welcome to Hollywood, bitch.

She did exactly what I said.
She went like that, then went like that,

88
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,048
and she went, like, "Oh, my God.
Fucking stop! I'm about to shit!

I'm gonna shit.
You want me to shit? I'll shit."

00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:49,391
I'm half-white, half-Filipino.
That's what I am.

91
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,397
Which means my dad was in the military.

92
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,614
That's not even a joke.

That's real shit.

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,494
A lot of soldiers were fighting
for this country.

95
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,912
My dad was dating.

00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,207
I'm his Purple Heart.

97
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:20,130
My dad would say borderline-racist shit
to me when I was a kid.

98
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,508
Borderline-racist shit.
But I knew he was joking. It's my dad.

Just sitting at the dinner table, like,
"You know why I married your mom, right?"

100
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,721
I'm, like, "Why?"

101
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,390
"Because I love Chinese food."

102
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,609
"She's Filipino, Dad."

103
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,529
"Whatever.

104
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,325
Rice is rice."

105
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,913
What the fuck? "Rice is rice!"

106
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,041
That's so racist!

107
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,003
I'm not knocking what my mom had to do
to get to America.

108
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:04,174
Fuck it. That's her hustle.
That was her hustle.

109
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,301
God bless you, Mom.

110
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,887
You hooked up with a soldier
and had a kid in America.

111
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,642
God bless you, Mom.
She did what she had to do.

112
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,565
She could've hooked up with a Filipino
and had a kid in the Philippines.

113
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,606
You know how much a comedian makes
in the Philippines?

114
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,777
A chicken and flip-flops.
Fuck that. Fuck that.

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,654
I don't even like flip-flops.

116
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,326
My mom was the shit.

117
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,829
My mom and dad divorced
when I was, like, ten, 11 years old.

118
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:40,210
My mom had to raise us on her own.
She did that shit on her own.

119
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,629
Tough as shit. She had...

120
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,756
[cheers and applause]

121
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,175
Sometimes a little too tough.

122
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,053
Like, it was borderline illegal, but...

123
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,431
It sucked.

124
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,393
My mom never took us to the doctor.

125
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,604
My mom raised us like we were still
in the Philippines.

126
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:05,568
She tried to cure everything at home,
like a real Filipino woman.

127
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,323
You had to...
You had to die to go to the hospital.

128
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:15,453
Shit. My mom cured everything
with Vicks VapoRub.

129
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,373
Vicks VapoRub!

130
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,295
I should've died nine times
when I was a kid.

131
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,133
That's abuse! There was one time
I thought I had pneumonia.

132
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,568
I go, "Mom, I think I have pneumonia."

133
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,137
She goes, "I'll put extra Vicks
on your body, Joseph.

134
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:38,309
Just rub it everywhere, Joseph.
Rub it on the bottom of the foot,

135
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,562
and then put a sock on the foot,

136
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,566
and then the pneumonia
will come out of the foot, Joseph."

137
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,864
I'm just smothered in fucking Vicks.

138
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,118
I should've called the cops.

139
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:00,123
One time I was so sick...
I swear to God, true story...

140
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,793
I go, "Mom, I don't feel good.
I can't sleep. I can't sleep, Mom."

141
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,172
My mom took her finger
and stuck it in Vicks

142
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,924
and rubbed it on top of my eyelids.

143
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,969
On top of my eyelids!

144
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:17,057
That shit burned so bad.
I go, "Mom, it burns!

145
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,309
I can't open my eyes!"

146
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,227
My mom goes, "Well, then you can sleep.

147
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,565
Good night, Joseph."

148
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,239
She didn't give a shit.

149
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,993
Mean.

150
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:43,208
She never hit us. My mom never hit us.
She just scared us a lot.

151
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,419
She loved to curse,
and she used to flex like that.

152
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,173
She used to do that shit!
She brought that to America!

153
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,886
Anyone that does this shit,
hey, my mom started that shit.

154
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,224
She did it to all of us.
You know how embarrassing that is,

155
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:03,311
to get punked by a four-foot-eight
Asian woman at the fucking mall?

156
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,523
"Get out of the goddamn Foot Locker.
Get out of the Foot Locker!"

157
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,983
"I'm not even in the Foot Locker!"

158
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:22,038
I used to cry and tell my mom,
"Mom, when I have kids,

159
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:26,126
I'm never gonna do what you do to me
to my kids."

160
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:30,147
And my mom looked at me... I swear to God...
she put her hand on my shoulder and goes,

161
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,090
"Joseph, promise me, okay?

162
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,051
Never have kids."

163
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,524
Shit on my dreams.
I'm telling you this:

164
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,569
I became a comedian,
which is totally against the grain

165
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,445
when you have a Filipino mom.

166
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:59,450
If you have a Filipino mom, that is not
the career choice you're supposed to have.

167
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:04,330
Filipino moms predetermine what their kids
are supposed to be when they grow up.

168
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,054
And you know I'm not making this shit up.

169
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,877
There's a lot of Filipinos in here,
right now,

170
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,336
that are nurses.

171
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,805
Today is a good day to get injured
at a show...

172
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,284
because there will be
a nurse in here, like...

173
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,908
[in Filipino accent] "Oh, my God.
Put a cold compress on the head.

174
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,773
Elebate the peet! Elebate...
Elebate the peet."

175
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:35,028
"What the fuck is 'elebate'?"
"Just lipt! Lipt the pucking peet!

176
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,654
Are you stupid?"

177
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:43,995
And I'm not... I'm not shitting on you
for being a nurse.

178
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,290
That's a great job, great benefits,
good money.

179
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,293
I'm just saying, it wasn't your dream.

180
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,838
That was your Filipino mom's dream.

181
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,343
My mom wanted <i>me </i>to be a nurse.
Are you fucking kidding me?

182
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:03,264
Filipino moms shit on their kids' dreams.
And you know I'm not lying.

183
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:07,268
You know I'm not lying.
You can't have a dream.

184
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,145
"What are you talking about... dream?"

185
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,858
I told my mom I wanted to be a comedian.
She cried. "Why?

186
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,570
Why do you want to be a comedian, Joseph?

187
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:23,743
All your aunties are nurses,
your cousins are nurses.

188
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,621
Do you see any clowns in this family?

189
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,248
I don't. Do you?"

190
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,879
Shit on my dream right there.

191
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:39,217
Just looked at me and went like this:
"Joseph, who told you you were funny?

192
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,391
It wasn't me."

193
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,520
That's fucked up.

194
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,357
I'm just saying...
you're a nurse, God bless you.

195
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,359
But you know
there are some nurses out there

196
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,986
that didn't follow their dreams.

197
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,755
There are some nurses working
at the hospital

198
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,406
that wish they were a Jabbawockee.

199
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,923
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

200
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,328
"Hey, follow me to the X-ray."
"I'll follow you..."

201
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,797
"Goddamn, that nurse can dance."

202
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,009
"It was always my dream.

203
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:26,389
My mother did not believe in me."

204
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,474
Oh, fuck.

205
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,444
It's either nurse or mailman.

206
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,531
Mailman's another strong option.

207
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,452
Oh, shit. My mom cried
and even suggested,

208
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,662
"Joseph, be a mailman.

209
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:55,084
Your uncles are mailmen.
Your cousins, they're mailmen."

210
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,173
My stepdad, he's white.
He's a fucking mailman!

211
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,801
I swear to God. I asked him,
"Fred, why'd you become a mailman?"

212
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,885
He's, like, "Your mama told me
to become a mailman.

213
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,724
She shit on my dreams."

214
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,896
I came home from school,

215
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,857
and my mom had my uncle come over
and talk to me

216
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,943
about getting into the post office.

217
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,237
That's how... Right? It's fucked up, right?

218
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,882
Come home from school,
and here's my uncle.

219
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:29,452
By the way, my uncle is one of
those Filipinos that hide their accent.

220
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,622
He's got a thick accent,
but he likes to hide the accent

221
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,583
because he doesn't want anyone to think
that he has an accent.

222
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,044
And it just ends up sounding
like a worse accent.

223
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,047
He sounds like a Filipino Elvis.

224
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,151
And I came home, I came through the door.
He got up, he's, like...

225
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,855
[deep voice, thick accent]
"Joseph, let me talk to you for a second.

226
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,522
So, I hear you want to be a comedian?"

227
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,565
Like, what the fuck did you just say?

228
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,237
Filipino moms,
stop turning into Filipino moms.

229
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,908
I can guarantee you right now...
There's a ton of Filipinos in here,

230
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,202
but I can tell you,
I don't know any of you,

231
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:15,289
but if you met my mom,
I guarantee she looks just like your mom.

232
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,501
Identical fucking twins.

233
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,545
Just...

234
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,924
They're just cut from the same cloth.

235
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,802
I don't know what it is
about Filipino women.

236
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,972
They're beautiful at the age of 20,
but right when they hit 69,

237
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,391
they all morph
into the same Filipino woman.

238
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,727
Short hair, glasses.

239
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,313
Louis Vuitton purse.

240
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,068
"Where are we? Seattle? Moore Theatre?"

241
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,365
[chuckling]

242
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,161
Break that mold, man.

243
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,166
I told my son. I told him.
I'm breaking that mold.

244
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:02,295
I looked at my son right in the eyes,
and I go, "Joe, look, if you have a dream

245
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:05,006
and you think you want to do it
and you believe in it,

246
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,509
then chase that dream. It'll happen."
That's what I said.

247
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,094
[cheers and applause]

248
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,056
"As long as you continue
to follow that dream,

249
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,976
your dad's got your back.
I got you, bro, 100 percent."

250
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,853
He goes, "Oh, my God. Thanks, Dad."

251
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,147
I go, "What do you want to be
when you grow up?"

252
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,357
He goes, "I want to be an architect."

253
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,526
And I go, "Joe...

254
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,779
I've seen you draw.

255
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,451
You got another dream?
What the fuck are you talking about?

256
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:37,622
You ever think about nursing?
Get the fuck out of here."

257
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,667
I love my kid, but I understand
where my mom's coming from,

258
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,127
because he's at that age.

259
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,964
Right when he turned 12, that's when
he just stopped taking care of himself.

260
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,884
And that's when I stopped
taking care of him.

261
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,447
Because that's what you're supposed to do
when you're a parent.

262
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,847
Twelve? "You should know how
to brush your teeth now.

263
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,308
You know what to do, Joe."

264
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,936
But now that I ignore the fact
that he doesn't brush his teeth,

265
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,941
I have to fucking deal with the breath.

266
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,485
The breath, it comes in hot.

267
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,988
Hot. And he's breathy when he talks.

268
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,281
[breathy voice]
"Dad.

269
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,618
Dad.

270
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,286
Dad."

271
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,373
I'm, like, "Joe, what did I tell you to do
when you talk to me?"

272
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,750
"Face the wall."

273
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,423
"Face the wall and write it down.

274
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,843
Let me read what the fuck
you're trying to say to me."

275
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,305
Armpits. God damn it.

276
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,517
Armpits smell like chopped onions.

277
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,187
And I always get mad. I'm, like,
"Joe, why do I smell it first?

278
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,941
I'm over here.
You're right fucking here."

279
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,798
I grab the deodorant every time.
"Joe, this is all you gotta do.

280
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,033
Just rub it under this armpit like that.
That's all you gotta do.

281
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,678
Now, listen to me.
Here's the important part.

282
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,664
When you go to the other armpit,
I want you to go across your mouth."

283
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:17,680
Just dirty. My son is dirty. He loves it.
He thinks it's the funniest thing.

284
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,599
Still doesn't know how
to sneeze correctly.

285
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,183
Are you kidding me?

286
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,270
My friend had a daughter
the same time I had my son.

287
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,439
She's been cute her whole life.

288
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,650
When she would sneeze, she'd announce it.
"I gotta sneeze, Mommy.

289
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,777
I need a napkin."

290
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,822
Her mom would run over with a napkin.

291
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,633
"Here you go, baby.
Put your nose in the napkin."

292
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,744
"I gotta sneeze, Mom.
I gotta sneeze."

293
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,078
[soft sneeze]

294
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,790
It's fucking beautiful.

295
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,501
Glitter.

296
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,923
When my son sneezes, no announcement.

297
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:57,303
His face just explodes, mid-conversation.

298
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,722
It always happens at the restaurant.

299
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,533
He's, like, "Dad,
did you see how many points..."

300
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,725
[splat]

301
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,193
And then I still help him.
I grab a napkin.

302
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,113
"Here, wipe your face, Joe."
Because I'm a good dad.

303
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,491
Let me do that with my mom
when I was a kid.

304
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,868
Shit. At the dinner table.

305
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,286
"Mom, can you pass a..."
[splat]

306
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,497
"Are you fucking kidding me?

307
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,796
Are your hands broken when you sneeze?

308
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,799
When you sneeze,
you can't use your fucking hands?

309
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:39,303
You could not go like that?
Now there's boogers on the chicken.

310
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,265
You're eating all the booger chicken,
Joseph.

311
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,936
All of that is yours.
Enjoy boogers and chicken.

312
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,354
Delicious, huh?"

313
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,026
The whole week, I gotta eat
booger chicken sandwiches at school.

314
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,321
And she'd make fun of me.
"How was your sandwich?

315
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,532
Salty, huh?

316
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,784
Cover your mouth."

317
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,203
I'm ready for my son,

318
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,581
and I'm financially prepared
to take care of him for the next 15 years.

319
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,253
I know that. As a man, as a dad,

320
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,880
I know I have to take care of my son
for the next 15 years.

321
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,674
Why? Because he's a boy.

322
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,053
Boys don't leave the fucking house.
They don't leave.

323
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,973
How do I know that?
Because I didn't leave the house.

324
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,727
I didn't leave the house till I was 28.

325
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,312
"I ain't leaving. My mom can cook."

326
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,023
And I'm ready for that.

327
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,735
Now, if I had a daughter,
I wouldn't put a dime away.

328
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,279
Not a penny. Not a cent. Why?

329
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,574
Because girls mature quicker,
they grow up faster,

330
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,993
and they get the fuck out of the house!

331
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:50,124
"Don't talk to me like that, Mom!
That's bullshit! I'm a fucking woman!

332
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,002
Don't touch me, Dad."

333
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,340
Girls at 18 don't give a shit.
They're ready for the world.

334
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,010
And you know what I'm talking about.
Don't act like you don't.

335
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,554
There's women in here that left at 18.

336
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,682
And the reason why I know
is because I have two sisters...

337
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,518
Gemma and Rowena.
Both of them left at 18,

338
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,771
and neither one of them came back.

339
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,316
That's some gangster shit.

340
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:20,196
My sister Rowena was the first one to go.
Had a full-time job at Wendy's.

341
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,698
Swear to God. Shift supervisor.

342
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,534
She thought she was a fucking millionaire!

343
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:31,207
Showed me her paychecks every week.
"Look at this shit. I'm rich."

344
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,629
And she was ready. Got into the last fight
with my mom in the living room.

345
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,132
She had it. "Whatever, Mom. I'm going.
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

346
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:43,016
I'm sick of these fucking rules.
I'm old enough to take care of myself.

347
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,971
And you know what? Me and Brian,
we've been looking for a place,

348
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,016
and when we find it,
I'm fucking out of here!"

349
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,312
And my mom just looked at her
and goes, "Are you fucking crazy?

350
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,273
Get the fuck out of here right now."

351
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:05,157
And my sister didn't even flinch.
"Fine! Fuck it! I'm out of here!"

352
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:09,578
And she left. My sister left at 18
and never came back.

353
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,081
That's some gangster shit.

354
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,668
I remember that day like it was yesterday.
She was in the garage,

355
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,670
loading the trunk of her car
with all her shit,

356
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,255
and I was upstairs in my room.

357
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:23,092
And then my sister yelled up to my room,
"I love you so much, Joe!"

358
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,552
And I started crying.

359
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,972
And I looked at my mom.
I go, "She's gonna die!

360
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,273
She's gonna die, Mom!"

361
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,609
And my mom looked at me and goes,
"Well, then let her die.

362
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,155
You want to die with her, Joseph?"

363
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,533
"I don't want to die!"

364
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,870
And she left, and she never came back.

365
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,291
Then my other sister, Gemma, 18... left.
She never came back.

366
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,335
My sisters are the shit. The shit!

367
00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:00,713
Because I didn't leave till I was 28.

368
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,009
Twenty-eight! And even then
I wasn't sure I was ready to go.

369
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,594
I swear to God.

370
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:09,557
I remember standing at the doorway
with a garbage bag full of my clothes,

371
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:12,558
and I looked at my mom. I go,
"Mom, are you sure you want me to leave?"

372
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,318
And my mom goes, "Yes, Joseph. It's time.

373
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,488
It's time for you to be a man now, Joseph.

374
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,825
Now move to the garage."

375
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,627
And I moved to the garage
like a fucking man.

376
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,629
Twenty-eight.

377
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,923
And then I moved back in at 29.

378
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,968
It was cold in that garage.

379
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:51,972
I go, "Mom, there's no insulation
in the garage."

380
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:56,060
And my mom let me back in.
"Come back in here, Joseph."

381
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,396
That's what she always does.
I always had second, third chances.

382
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,484
"Come back in here, Joseph.
I was just joking.

383
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,821
I thought you were the comedian."

384
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,828
And I moved back in at 29.

385
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:19,458
And then I moved out again at 32.
But fuck it. That's what boys do.

386
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,672
Shit. My sisters never got
a second chance.

387
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,591
Once they were gone, that was it.
She didn't give a shit.

388
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,759
"Bye.

389
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,428
Don't even call me.

390
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,974
You think you can do it?
Oh, go. Do it.

391
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,977
It's cold out there, huh?"

392
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:44,191
My sisters would get into epic fights
with my mom.

393
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,944
Like, some of the shit they would say...
unbelievable.

394
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,321
I remember watching those fights
when I was a kid.

395
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:52,783
My sister Rowena, especially.
Holy shit. Every weekend.

396
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,410
"Mom, I'm going out with my friend.

397
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,429
Why do you always question me
every time I go out with my friend?"

398
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,789
"Yeah. Because every weekend,
it's a different guy."

399
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,643
"Yeah, Mom, it's called dating.
I'm dating people. I'm allowed to do that.

400
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,520
I don't go to school anymore.
I make my own money.

401
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,904
I want to go out and date and have fun.
Is that a big deal?"

402
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,464
"Yeah, but you go out every weekend,

403
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,758
just gallivanting with different people
all the time."

404
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,569
"They're not different people!
They're my friends!"

405
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,530
"Sure, they're you're friends.
They're just people out there.

406
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,889
You're giving your <i>pekpek </i>away
to everybody!

407
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,742
You don't even know them.
Who wants <i>pekpek? </i>You want <i>pekpek?</i>

408
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,561
That's a <i>pekpek </i>for you.
You want it? There! It's for free!"

409
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,566
<i>"Pekpek"</i> is "pussy."

410
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,380
There's some people that got it,

411
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,685
but then there's some, like,
"Is she giving chickens away?

412
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:36,368
Every weekend, she has a chicken
and she gives it away?

413
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,828
That's expensive."

414
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:44,710
But now they made up.
Now they're friends. Best of friends.

415
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,337
Seeing my mom and sister make up:
Funniest shit ever.

416
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,717
Just seeing my mom cry.
"I just want you to know that...

417
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,179
I didn't think you gave your <i>pekpek </i>away
to everybody."

418
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:01,852
"Well, I didn't, Mom. It's right here.
It's the same one you gave me."

419
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:07,024
Man, I get it, Mom.
God bless you. That shit is hard.

420
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,861
My son's 13, and it just keeps getting
harder and harder.

421
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,488
It's so hard.

422
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,033
My son is in the seventh grade.
God damn it.

423
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,536
I want all you new parents
to know this right now.

424
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,332
When you were in the seventh grade
and you weren't smart,

425
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,420
you're definitely not gonna be smart
when your kid gets to the seventh grade.

426
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,464
It's harder.

427
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,218
My son and I are failing Math.

428
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,599
It's so hard.

429
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:45,896
Now he's getting a C-minus in Math.
C-minus in Math.

430
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:51,360
In private school, that's not good.
That's failing Math.

431
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,321
So, of course, she brings me in
for a parent-teacher meeting.

432
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,948
Private school. That's what they do.

433
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,951
They sit you down
because they're concerned.

434
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:08,335
"Hi. [chuckles] Mr. Koy.
Mr. Koy, please sit down.

435
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,505
I don't want to startle you.
I want to nip this in the bud.

436
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:18,679
Just want you to know, Mr. Koy,
that your son has a C-minus in Math.

437
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,805
Uh-oh.

438
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,683
Uh-oh.

439
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,268
That's not good.

440
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,437
What are we gonna do
to solve that, Mr. Koy?

441
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,606
You need to help me help him.

442
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,942
I can do whatever I can
over here at school,

443
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,319
but when he gets home,
you need to crack open that book

444
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:37,781
and start working on those questions
with your son.

445
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,201
Let's bring that grade back up.
Let's do this as a team, Mr. Koy.

446
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,619
Come on!"

447
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:54,840
And I was, like,
"You know I'm a comedian, right?

448
00:27:56,133 --> 00:28:00,429
And I hired you to teach my son math.

449
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:02,598
Uh-oh.

450
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,350
Uh-oh.

451
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,145
What are we gonna do to fix that?

452
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:14,026
Sounds like you owe me money."

453
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,491
If you have kids,
take them to public school.

454
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,995
That's the only...
Public school, please.

455
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,207
I'm paying college tuition
for my son's seventh-grade education.

456
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:33,445
And then I get a call from the principal.
"Mr. Koy, you forgot to pay your milk fee.

457
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,882
You forgot to pay your milk fee, Mr. Koy."

458
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,427
I go, "I paid the tuition.
I thought it was included in the tuition."

459
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,638
"No, Mr. Koy, that's separate."

460
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:50,187
I got so mad.
I was filling out that paperwork,

461
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,291
and I just looked at my son. I go,
"I can't believe I'm filling out paperwork

462
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,608
to pay for milk."

463
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,503
He goes,
"What are you talking about, Dad?"

464
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:01,406
I go, "When I filled out paperwork,
it was so I can get free milk.

465
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,160
We were poor, Joe.

466
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,913
We couldn't afford milk,

467
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,791
so my mom filled out paperwork
so we could get a free milk.

468
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,294
I couldn't wait to get to school
so I could actually taste calcium.

469
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,382
And it's delicious when it's free."

470
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,736
He didn't know what a free milk was,

471
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,137
so I had to explain to him
what a free milk looked like.

472
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:26,390
I go, "Joe, a free milk
was a carton of milk

473
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,308
that looked like a house from <i>Monopoly.</i>

474
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,230
And it had three simple instructions.
You pulled the right side to the right,

475
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,648
the left side to the left,

476
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,317
and then you pinched the middle
and pulled it towards your chest,

477
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,569
and it's supposed to make a spout.

478
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,822
But it never made a fucking spout.

479
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,785
So, you turned it to the back
and started over.

480
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:52,833
That side had too much glue.
You couldn't even open that fucking side.

481
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,227
So you just ripped it open in the middle.

482
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:56,628
Now you're drinking milk
out of a square box.

483
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,511
And when you were done with that milk,
you put soil in it and a bean,

484
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,096
and you grew a tree."

485
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,724
Yeah. Public school.

486
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,274
I gotta get my son to be humble.

487
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,694
How is my son gonna be humble
when I've been driving him to school?

488
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,072
His whole school career,
he's been chauffeured to school.

489
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,493
He's never been on a bus before.
That shit will make you humble.

490
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:33,498
Go to school on a public bus.
He doesn't even know what a public bus...

491
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,376
I just found out my son doesn't know
what a school bus is.

492
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,463
We were driving on the freeway,
and a school bus passed us,

493
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,882
and my son goes like this:
"Where are they going?"

494
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,891
"Fucking school, asshole.

495
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,186
Who's this dick?"

496
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,654
He's been going to school...
You gotta go to school on a bus.

497
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:06,782
That shit will make you humble.

498
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,994
Go to school on a bus with a bunch of kids
that hate their fucking life.

499
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,663
That was me. I hated my life.

500
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,917
I was the last kid on,
and I was the last kid off.

501
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,420
Hated that shit. Every time I got on,
there was only one seat left,

502
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,465
and there was always that one kid
that didn't want to share the seat.

503
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,633
And I'd walk up to him.

504
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,969
He's, like, "You better not even think
about sitting here."

505
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,932
And I'd go, "Where am I supposed to sit?"

506
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,560
"I don't fucking care."

507
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,981
And the bus driver doesn't give a shit.

508
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:43,068
"You'd better sit down back there."
"I don't know where to sit.

509
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,156
He's not gonna let me sit down.

510
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,662
She's getting mad.
She's not gonna go unless I sit down.

511
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,706
I won't even sit on the whole thing.

512
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:02,212
Just let me... let me sit on the edge."

513
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:06,341
I had to sit on the edge
and then hold the seat across the aisle.

514
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,929
I went to school
looking like I took a shit on the bus.

515
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,309
And then he'd still fuck with me.

516
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,521
"Why do you smell like Vicks?"

517
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,613
"Because I have pneumonia."

518
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,789
He's got it so good.

519
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:43,003
I've got to stop spoiling him.
I spoil him too much.

520
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,296
It sucks.

521
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,568
But the reason I spoil him is because
I didn't have shit when I was a kid.

522
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,510
We were broke as shit.

523
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,138
And now that I can afford it,
I'm buying everything.

524
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:57,058
And yes, it's for him, but he doesn't know
that it's actually for us.

525
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:03,648
All that cool shit he has, I want it, too.
I want it so bad.

526
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,192
This Christmas pissed me off.

527
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:07,652
I go, "Joe, you want a PS4 for Christmas?"
He goes, "No."

528
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,404
I go, "Why the fuck not?

529
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,991
You're selfish, bro."

530
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:21,291
I want all that shit.
I want all those toys.

531
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:25,212
And I'm holding back, but it's hard.
It's so damn hard.

532
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,591
We went to the mall. This was, like,
seven months ago, eight months ago.

533
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,053
And the kiosk with the hoverboards.

534
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,598
Oh, shit. And my son got on it
like a fucking natural.

535
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,309
He just got on and was, like,
"Oh, my God. Dad.

536
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,269
Dad.

537
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,064
Dad!

538
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,487
Dad! I've got to have this, Dad.
I've got to have this."

539
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,715
And I just looked at him,
and this is what I said in my head.

540
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,908
I go, "Yes, we do."

541
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,412
But I was being a good dad.

542
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,748
I was, like, "No.
I can't buy that for you."

543
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:05,293
He goes, "Why not?"
I go, "Because you have a C-minus in Math,

544
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,128
and I can't reward you for that.

545
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:10,298
Bring the grade up to a B,
and I'll buy it for you."

546
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,382
My son goes like this:
"Are you serious right now?"

547
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,888
And this is what I said, I swear to God.
I went like this: "I know, right?

548
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,562
Why'd you fail the test, man?"

549
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,940
We both left that mall
just fucking crying.

550
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,735
I wanted that hoverboard so bad.

551
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,364
And then I told him,
"Joe, I'll buy you that hoverboard.

552
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,367
I'm gonna get you a tutor,
and she's gonna help you with your math.

553
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,160
You bring the grade up, it's done."

554
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:40,537
So, I get the tutor.

555
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,208
This is how shitty of a dad I am.
Just for one week with the tutor,

556
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:48,461
he has a quiz the following week.
Four out of five right.

557
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,505
Doesn't even apply to the grade.

558
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,425
And I just looked at him like this:
"Look at you, Einstein.

559
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,346
Looks like we need to go to the mall
and get something, don't we?"

560
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,854
And I got that hoverboard.
Oh, I fucking love that thing.

561
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,939
I ride it every morning.

562
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,983
[bleeping sounds]

563
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:14,904
"You want cereal?"

564
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:18,342
"Yes, Dad."
"I'll be right back."

565
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,784
[bleeping sounds]

566
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:29,002
I crashed on that hoverboard. Holy shit.

567
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,420
I got wood floors at my house.

568
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,297
This is what it sounded like
when I crashed.

569
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,884
Twice, because I skipped across the floor.

570
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,181
And this is how old I am. When I finally
landed, this is what I said.

571
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,557
I went, "Uhh!

572
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,644
Oh, fucking hip!

573
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,689
Oh, my fucking hip! It's broken!"

574
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,317
And my son doesn't give two shits
about me.

575
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,736
He came around the corner
and went like this: "Dad?

576
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,404
Where's my hoverboard?"

577
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,119
"Fuck you, Joe.

578
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,330
Fuck you."

579
00:36:09,793 --> 00:36:11,836
Don't buy that hoverboard.

580
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,689
I don't even know why
they sell it in America.

581
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:17,676
I don't know how they got past inspection.
They're dangerous.

582
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,304
When the battery's dead,
it doesn't even tell you.

583
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,478
I swear to God, it just stops mid-ride.

584
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:31,690
And then it catapults you across
the living room at 17 miles per hour.

585
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:36,403
I'm flying through the air with
a bowl of cereal, like, "What the fuck?!

586
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,196
Shit!"

587
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:48,164
Thirteen. God damn it.
They grow fast, you guys.

588
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,835
He's at that age where he doesn't want
to kiss me anymore. It makes me so sad.

589
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,588
I hate it. "Have a good day at school."
He's like this: "All right."

590
00:36:58,842 --> 00:36:59,968
And I...

591
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:14,023
I don't know what to do now.
Turning into a man.

592
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,877
I don't like the way God tells you
that your son is turning into a man.

593
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:21,531
It's too quick. I'm not even
mentally prepared for this.

594
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,592
I found out last year
that he's turning into a man.

595
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,619
It sucked. Last year...
This is when I found out.

596
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:29,873
He was in the pool, swimming,
and I'm on the outside of the pool,

597
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,500
just watching my son swim.
He comes out of the pool.

598
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,562
This is what he says to me, word-for-word,
when he comes out of the pool.

599
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,547
He went like this:
"This pubic hair is tickling my butt."

600
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,435
And when he said "pubic hair,"
he meant one pubic hair.

601
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:56,065
Just one. It's so long,
it's tickling his asshole.

602
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,821
And I started crying.
I go, "Why do you have a pubic hair?

603
00:38:03,323 --> 00:38:04,616
Why?"

604
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,536
And that's it. That's it.
The pube is here.

605
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,333
That was last year. He's 13 now.
How many does he have now, 20?

606
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,172
I'm not ready for that.
No more toys anymore.

607
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:22,258
No more of the cute toys
he used to play with when he was 11, 12.

608
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,969
Transformers,
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles... fuck that.

609
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,638
He's got a new toy.

610
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,225
He's got a new toy that he's gonna love
to play with a lot more.

611
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,774
He's probably gonna play with it
in front of the old toys.

612
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:46,032
And there's nothing I can do about it.
I'm not prepared for that. My son?

613
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:48,493
Now! This is when it starts!

614
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,579
Thirteen. This is when it starts.

615
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:54,499
Shit! And I'm gonna catch him.

616
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,128
I'm gonna catch him. It's inevitable.
I'm gonna catch my son jerking off.

617
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,965
Are you kidding me?
And what do I say to him when I catch him?

618
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,218
I don't even know what to say to him.
What do I say? "Stop doing that"?

619
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,012
That's fucked up. I'm still doing that!

620
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,351
Who the fuck am I?

621
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,770
"Only one guy jerks off in this house.

622
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,940
And since I own it,
take your little dick outside.

623
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,235
This is <i>my </i>lotion."

624
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:30,618
He's gonna get caught.
Because boys are sloppy with their work.

625
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,306
They're sloppy with their work,
and you know what I'm talking about.

626
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,583
They just...
They don't know what to fucking do.

627
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,209
Thirteen?

628
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:39,502
[grunts]

629
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,675
[grunts]

630
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,929
I was the creepiest. When I was 13? Shit.

631
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,181
Thirteen... I could eat cereal, jerk off,

632
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,351
watch cartoons and look out for my mom
at the same time.

633
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:56,895
Just creepy shit.

634
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,786
"Aah! Shit!"

635
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,170
It's gross.

636
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,507
It's gross, but it's life. This is it.

637
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,801
I'm gonna catch him. Fuck.

638
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,931
He's gonna be so creepy.
Boys are creepy with their work.

639
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,142
They don't know.
The first times that they do it,

640
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:39,062
the first 20 times, nothing comes out,
ladies. You do know that, right?

641
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,314
It's just you and your friend at a party.

642
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,652
And then your friend starts to dry-heave
for no reason.

643
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,820
[laughing]

644
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:49,072
[grunts]

645
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:53,284
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

646
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:54,494
[grunting]

647
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,374
Yeah!

648
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:07,423
And that's why we get caught.
Because we think that happens every time.

649
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:08,508
And it's not.

650
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:12,178
One day, something comes out,
and we don't know what to fucking do.

651
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,697
It catches us off guard.
We're, like...

652
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,889
[chuckling]
Blam!

653
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,015
"Aah!

654
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,519
No, no, no, no!

655
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,731
Oh, no! Oh, my God!

656
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:27,568
No, no! No!

657
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:29,821
Oh, my God!

658
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,866
I'm ready for church!"

659
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,665
You go to church with a come-print
on your chest.

660
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,839
I want every woman to know this right now.
We don't stop.

661
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:52,885
We don't stop, all right? I didn't stop.

662
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,264
Been doing it since I was a kid.
I got caught by my mom.

663
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,017
My mom caught me. Worst day of my life.

664
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:03,604
Worst day of my... And I don't like
how quiet it is in this room right now.

665
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,567
I really don't. I don't like how
every guy is looking at me like:

666
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,610
"This is kind of disgusting.

667
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,530
I don't know what he's talking about.

668
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,367
How could he get caught by his mother?"

669
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,745
I want every guy in this room
to know this tonight.

670
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,999
You got caught by your mom, too.
She caught your dumb ass.

671
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:27,378
She saw it. That's a grown woman.
She knows what her teenage son is doing.

672
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,173
She just never said anything
to your dumb ass.

673
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:34,052
But she found it. Whatever it was
you were abusing, she found it.

674
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,576
She just didn't tell you about it.
She was cleaning your room.

675
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,940
And she was, like,
"Oh, let me get that plate.

676
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,935
Oh, that's not a plate.

677
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:46,314
That's a towel."

678
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:01,412
She just... She didn't say anything to you.
My mom said something to me,

679
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,831
because that's the kind of
fucking mom I got.

680
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,543
But I thought I was bulletproof.

681
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:10,546
Sock. Genius. Sock.

682
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,758
Sock, hamper. Sock, hamper.

683
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,676
All week. Sock, hamper.

684
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,471
Sock, hamper.

685
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,349
Two-a-day Friday.
Sock, sock, hamper, hamper.

686
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,728
Then Sunday came around.
My mom walked into my room.

687
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,438
"Stop fucking your socks.

688
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,983
Are you kidding me right now?

689
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,071
You want me to clean it? Fuck you, Joseph.

690
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:38,157
That's disgusting.
I've been throwing all your socks away.

691
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,536
You have two pair of socks left
for the rest of the year.

692
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,747
You fuck those... no more socks, Joseph.

693
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:47,458
You're gonna go to school
barefoot like that, huh?

694
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,479
The principal will call me.
'Joseph doesn't have any socks.'

695
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:53,673
'Yeah, because he keeps fucking them!'"

696
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,895
We all do it. We all do it.

697
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,232
Every guy in here still does it.

698
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,485
It's creepy. We'll move on from this,
but I just want to keep going.

699
00:44:15,528 --> 00:44:17,196
We've got plenty of time to kill.

700
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:21,409
Every guy does it, though.
We haven't stopped.

701
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,869
We become better at it.

702
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,707
We don't stop because we're creeps,
ladies.

703
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,209
We're just creepy people.

704
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:32,187
I don't care how long
you've been with your man...

705
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,673
five years, ten years, five days...
it doesn't matter.

706
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,008
That's his shit.

707
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,137
I want every woman to know this:

708
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,308
The creepiest man in this room tonight
is the guy you came with.

709
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:50,271
I swear to God.
There's no one creepier in this room.

710
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,274
Don't look across the aisle
or up in the balcony.

711
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,860
He's sitting right fucking next to you.

712
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,864
That guy is a creepy, creepy fuck.

713
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,578
Don't give it to him for a couple days.
Watch him just, "Uhh!"

714
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,914
I don't care how good-looking your man is.

715
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:09,999
When we jerk off, we all look the same.

716
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,045
Creepy. By ourselves.

717
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,047
One shoe on. Always one shoe on.

718
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,634
Look at the toe! Look at the fucking toe!

719
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,720
Shirt tucked under the chin.

720
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,809
Shirt tucked under the chin.
Did you know that, ladies?

721
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,270
Did you know your man tucks the shirt
under his chin?

722
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:32,897
You want to know why?

723
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,692
Because he doesn't want
the bottom of the shirt to touch his dick,

724
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:39,779
because he's still gonna wear that shirt
for the rest of the day.

725
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,452
Creepy fucker's gonna wear
his jerk-off shirt

726
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,870
to the comedy show tonight.

727
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,383
Don't shake anyone's hand in here tonight.

728
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:05,554
I swear to God,
the diversity in this room is amazing.

729
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,978
I will tell you this right now.

730
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,861
I'm just gonna be honest with you guys.
I'm gonna put it all out there.

731
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,484
No one is more indirectly racist
than Filipino moms.

732
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,574
My sister's about to marry her fiancé.

733
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,868
He's dark. He's dark. Darker than you.

734
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,080
My sister got the darkest one.

735
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,750
There's black, and then there's nighttime.

736
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,254
Andre is nighttime.

737
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:41,424
Andre used to kill it in hide-and-seek
when he was a kid.

738
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,136
Didn't even have to hide.
Just closed his eyes like that.

739
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:49,432
"Where are you, Andre?"
"Right here, motherfuckers.

740
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,183
I win again."

741
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:56,188
You should've seen how my mom acted
when she met Andre for the first time.

742
00:46:56,272 --> 00:46:58,250
When he walked into the house,
my mom went like this.

743
00:46:58,274 --> 00:46:59,608
[shudders]

744
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:08,909
"Put my purse in the room.
Put my purse in the room."

745
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,624
I got so mad at my mom.

746
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,794
I took her to the kitchen.
I was, like, "Mom, are you kidding me?

747
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:22,006
Just because he's black, you want me
to put your purse in the room?

748
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,632
Are you kidding me right now?"

749
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:28,512
And then she got mad at me
and made <i>me </i>feel like the racist.

750
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,765
Some Filipino Jedi shit.

751
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,602
She just looked at me and goes,
"Oh, just because he's black, Joseph,

752
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,729
and I told you to put my purse
in the room,

753
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,315
you think your mother is a racist?

754
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:42,359
Wow, Joseph.

755
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,528
Wow.

756
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,947
Wow.

757
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,951
I would do that with any stranger, Joseph.

758
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,455
White, black, Latino, Asian.
I don't care.

759
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,874
If I don't know you,
put my purse in the room.

760
00:47:58,626 --> 00:48:00,169
That's a Louis Vuitton."

761
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,674
I go, "Mom, you know what you did.
Stop right now.

762
00:48:05,758 --> 00:48:08,135
You're making Andre feel
very uncomfortable."

763
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,305
And my mom looked at me and goes,
"I'm not making him feel uncomfortable.

764
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,975
You are. Bringing me into the kitchen
to talk to me.

765
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,852
Are you kidding me right now?

766
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,897
I'm doing everything to make Andre
feel comfortable.

767
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,275
I'm frying chicken,
I put basketball on the TV."

768
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,662
"Out of everything
you could've cooked tonight,

769
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,040
you decided to fry chicken."

770
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,960
"Joseph, they love chicken."

771
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,504
They love...

772
00:48:44,505 --> 00:48:46,715
"They love chicken, Joseph."

773
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,345
Right when I said that,
Andre walked into the kitchen.

774
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,180
He's, like, "Oh, I'm sorry.

775
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:59,520
Sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't know y'all was in the kitchen.

776
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,358
Quick question: Are y'all frying chicken?"

777
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:11,949
And my mom goes, "Yes, Andre.
We're... We're frying chicken.

778
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,786
But if you don't like chicken, I can...

779
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,830
I can cook something else, if...

780
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,041
if you don't like chicken."

781
00:49:29,258 --> 00:49:33,053
And Andre was, like,
"Oh, no, no. I love chicken.

782
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,556
I eat it every day."

783
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,685
And then he walked out of the kitchen.

784
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,063
And then my mom looked at me
and went like this:

785
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,399
[whispers]
"I told you."

786
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,785
That's a very racist...

787
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:59,246
Right? That's racist. Right, black guy?

788
00:50:01,916 --> 00:50:06,170
That's a racist... You want to hear
the most racist part about that story?

789
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,964
Andre doesn't talk like that.

790
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:18,766
I gave Andre an '80s black rapper voice
because it's funnier.

791
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,393
If you ever meet Andre,
he talks like this:

792
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:22,853
"Hello. My name is Andre."

793
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,858
I made him talk... "I love chicken!"
Who the fuck talks like that?

794
00:50:27,942 --> 00:50:30,003
I've never even met a black guy
that talks about chicken like,

795
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,796
[rapping]
"I love chicken, I eat it every day.

796
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,114
I eat that chicken in every kind of way."

797
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:35,324
[grunts]

798
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,963
She's getting married.
My sister's getting married. Shit.

799
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,508
That's good, right?
How long have you guys been together?

800
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,968
[woman] Eighteen years.

801
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,512
Eighteen years? Goddamn.

802
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,348
Eighteen strong years.
You got kids? Two kids?

803
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,684
How old are the kids. Eighteen and what?

804
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,319
Did you watch the baby come out?

805
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:16,365
Did you watch the baby come out?
You better, man.

806
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,950
You've got to watch that shit.

807
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,205
That's why a lot of you guys out there...

808
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:24,957
If you don't pay your child support,

809
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,835
I want you to start thinking
about what happened that day.

810
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,964
And remember,
that shit costs a lot of money.

811
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,384
I give my ex whatever the fuck she wants.

812
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:39,096
I saw that baby come out.
Fuck that shit.

813
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:45,269
And a lot of you women
need to be more graphic with these guys

814
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,872
that ain't paying their child support.

815
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,648
Let them hear. Stop being nice about it.

816
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:51,775
"Your daughter wants
to take ballet classes.

817
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,570
She needs shoes and some lessons.

818
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:58,866
Your son wants to play sports.
He needs cleats and some gear."

819
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:03,078
Fuck that. Be graphic.
"Why do I want extra money?

820
00:52:03,162 --> 00:52:06,248
Because those kids ripped my pussy apart.

821
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:11,503
Ripped. Ripped.

822
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,922
Ripped it. Ripped."

823
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,514
It doesn't stay like that.

824
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,701
I don't want you to think it's ripped
and stays like that.

825
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:27,162
That's the cool thing about the vagina.
It comes back together.

826
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,356
It's fucking... It's like a Transformer.

827
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,900
It's like Pussimus Prime.

828
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:34,818
It's like, "Babybots."

829
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,320
[grinding]

830
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,405
"What the fuck?!"

831
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:52,669
I saw that baby come out.
Fuck that shit.

832
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:55,422
The vagina is beautiful,
just not that day.

833
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,342
That day, it's its evil twin.

834
00:52:59,385 --> 00:53:01,762
It's not even vagina.
It's called "va-gina."

835
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,223
"I am Va-gina.

836
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,101
I'm delivering a baby.

837
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,812
Push, baby.

838
00:53:10,479 --> 00:53:12,731
Oh, come out of Va-gina.

839
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:16,235
Push! Oh, here comes the baby!

840
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,737
Oh, here comes the baby!

841
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,489
Oh, baby!"

842
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:29,164
My son's head was hanging out like this.

843
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:30,767
And then she coughed,
and he went back in.

844
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,584
I was, like, "Oh, shit!

845
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,340
Her pussy just ate the baby!"

846
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,012
I just remember my son going, "Dad!"

847
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,273
Dating. Dating, right?
It's rough, right? Shit.

848
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,651
Here's the thing about dating.
All you need is just to be secure.

849
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:01,822
Just be secure and your girl
is gonna fucking love you.

850
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,700
Stop being insecure.
The minute you're insecure

851
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,494
and start questioning her,
it fucking turns her off.

852
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:09,806
Don't question her every time she goes out
with her girlfriends.

853
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,081
"Where are you going?"

854
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:14,001
"I'm going out with my girlfriends.
I told you that already."

855
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,670
"Okay, what time are you gonna be home?"

856
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:20,174
"I don't know. Maybe later.
I don't know. What the fuck?

857
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:24,470
Seriously? Do I do this shit with you
on your fucking guys' night out?"

858
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,781
"I'm just saying. I just want to know..."

859
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:27,890
[mumbling]

860
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:34,062
They hate that shit.
Just be secure and let her fucking go.

861
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,274
That turns a girl on.
Ignore her. She loves that shit.

862
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:41,403
It pisses her off,
and she loves it at the same time.

863
00:54:41,487 --> 00:54:45,699
When you don't call her the whole time.
It even confuses her when she leaves.

864
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,822
"I'm going out with my girls."
"All right, see you."

865
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,412
"But are you gonna ask where..."

866
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,501
"No. Just go with your girls."

867
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:57,377
"All right. That's crazy."

868
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:02,341
Don't call her the whole night.
Just ignore her.

869
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:04,176
She'll be at the club, freaking out.

870
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,763
Just fucking dancing,
looking at her phone.

871
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,097
"What the fuck?"

872
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,440
That shit turns her on.

873
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,362
Because guys get mad at girls
when they go out with their girlfriends.

874
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,447
Stop being insecure. Fuck it.

875
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,300
If she goes out with her friends,
she goes out with her friends.

876
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,202
And the guys always get mad.
"Yeah, but every time she goes out,

877
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,871
guys buy her drinks,
and then she fucking takes them."

878
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,291
No shit! They're free, asshole.

879
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,503
Wouldn't you take a goddamn drink
for free?

880
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,731
If a girl walked up to you...
"Hey, I'd like to buy you a drink,"

881
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,549
you'd be, like, "What the fuck?

882
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,760
Can you buy my friends some?"

883
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:53,225
And if a guy is buying
your chick at the club a drink,

884
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,562
that means she's one of
the hottest chicks in the fucking club.

885
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:58,814
So you should proud of that shit.

886
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,817
And don't get mad at her
for getting free drinks.

887
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,776
That's her hustle. She's hot,

888
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:06,405
and she's getting free drinks
from a dude at a club.

889
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,032
You don't have to worry about it
because she has your back.

890
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,451
Every girl that has a man
and she's at a club

891
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:12,828
has her dude's back.

892
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,871
Swear to God.
And you know what I'm talking about.

893
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:19,501
She'll keep getting those drinks for free.
She'll get them, as many as she can.

894
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,728
"I'm gonna drink free all night."

895
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,981
And then, when that question comes:
"Do you have a boyfriend?"

896
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,382
"Yeah, he's at home.
His name's John. He's black. Bye!

897
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:31,597
Bye. Bye! Thank you!"

898
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,767
Because that's what women do.

899
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,645
They get your back,
and you know what I'm talking about.

900
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,607
Every guy's bought drinks for a girl
that had a guy, and you know it.

901
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,210
They drop it on you at the last second
because that's what women do.

902
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,629
So, don't get mad at your girl
when she goes out with these guys.

903
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,573
Let them go. Let them have
as many drinks as they want.

904
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,326
Let them fucking get tore the fuck up.

905
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,828
As many drinks. Let her get them.
As many drinks.

906
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,205
"Thank you. Thank you."

907
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,584
All fucking night.
She's gonna get fucked up.

908
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:03,795
And then she's gonna come home drunk,

909
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:06,214
and then she's gonna want
to suck your dick...

910
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,259
on his tab!

911
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,845
"What the fuck?

912
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,681
This blowjob is free?!"

913
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,648
Stop being insecure. Let them go.

914
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:25,400
In fact, when your girl goes out,
you go out.

915
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:28,612
Don't stay at home. Go get fucked up, too.

916
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,950
That's the best sex you'll ever have.
You both ignore each other all night,

917
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,077
you both get fucked up
with your own friends,

918
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,496
and then you both come home
drunk as shit.

919
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:39,456
That's the funniest shit.

920
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,250
And the guy's always the first one home.

921
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:53,887
"Babe!

922
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:56,598
Babe!"

923
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,059
Nobody's home.

924
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,620
Then, all of a sudden, she walks
through the door, drunk as shit.

925
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:03,939
[chuckles]

926
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,900
"Hi, baby."

927
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,445
She's limping because she has one heel on.

928
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,658
"Hi, baby."

929
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:16,785
"Hi, babe.

930
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,538
Hi, babe."

931
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:20,914
"Hi, baby.

932
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,003
Why didn't you text me all night?"

933
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,172
"I didn't know where my phone was."

934
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,050
It's a fucking square right here.

935
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:37,055
That turns her on.

936
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,558
"Your phone is right there, you stupid.

937
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,519
Your phone's right there, stupid.

938
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,689
I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

939
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:49,776
They're drunk and horny.
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.

940
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,987
I swear to God.
I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

941
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,740
And then he's, like,
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

942
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:58,118
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

943
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,496
Then you guys walk towards each other,
about to fuck each other,

944
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,873
but it's not even cute.

945
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,625
It just looks like two zombies
about to fuck each other.

946
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,627
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

947
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,671
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

948
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,339
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

949
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,633
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

950
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,261
"I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you."

951
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:25,562
The woman always gets
to the bedroom first, completely naked.

952
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:29,066
Completely naked.
"Come on, baby. Come on.

953
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,650
Oh, I'm gonna fuck the shit..."

954
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,152
This foot completely dirty.

955
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:37,199
This one clean, completely clean.
This one... gravel in the heel.

956
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,786
"Come on, baby.
I'm gonna fuck the shit out of you.

957
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:41,912
Come on."

958
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:47,334
The man's walking down the hallway,
fully clothed.

959
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,421
Drunk.

960
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,008
Taking his time.

961
00:59:56,885 --> 01:00:00,055
He's kind of mad, too,
because not only is he drunk,

962
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,182
but his dick is more drunk.

963
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:05,102
And he doesn't know what to do,

964
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:08,021
because it's about to happen,
but he can't.

965
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:13,068
And drunk guys will talk to their dicks.
They don't give a shit.

966
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,444
Like, "Come on, wake up.

967
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:20,492
Come on. Why are you doing this to me?
Let's go. Why are you doing..."

968
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,578
And their dick is, like,
"I'm drunk, too, asshole.

969
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,623
What the fuck do you want me to do?"

970
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:30,877
We'll start grabbing blood from anywhere.
"Don't do this to me.

971
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:36,925
You need to give me something.
Don't do this to me."

972
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:42,973
But our dick's our best friend.
He doesn't leave us hanging.

973
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,350
He gives us something.
It's not much, but it's something.

974
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:49,938
It's like half-and-half.
Soft on top, hard in the middle.

975
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,276
And it's barely holding up. It's just
balancing on the balls like this.

976
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,864
"Try this. This might work.
This might work."

977
01:00:58,947 --> 01:01:00,883
And we're, like,
"Are you sure you're gonna work?"

978
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:03,618
"Hurry up before I change
my fucking mind."

979
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:06,872
And we go to put him in. He's, like,
"Man, I can't fucking do this."

980
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,511
I love you guys. Thank you so much.
