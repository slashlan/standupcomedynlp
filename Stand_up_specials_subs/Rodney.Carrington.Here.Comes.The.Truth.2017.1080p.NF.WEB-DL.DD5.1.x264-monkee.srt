1
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:17,317
[announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the next
president of the United States of America:

2
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,152
Rodney Carrington!

3
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,788
[cheering]

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,291
How are you?

5
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,461
Hi, everybody.

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,897
[whistling, cheering]

7
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,433
Do not adjust your glasses.

8
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:36,403
I'm this goddamn fat, alright?

9
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,104
[laughter]

10
00:00:39,406 --> 00:00:43,109
I... I used to look at fat people and go,

11
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,980
"How in the hell did you let yourself
get like that?"

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,716
And then I just went out
and found out for myself.

13
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,987
I got divorced about four years ago.

14
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:57,257
And you don't know how important it is

15
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,262
to have somebody in your life,
around eight or nine o'clock at night,

16
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,030
to say, "Don't eat that."

17
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,601
"You do not need to be eating
chocolate cake this time of night."

18
00:01:09,202 --> 00:01:11,604
Because when you live by yourself
like I do,

19
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,706
and you buy cake, put it in the kitchen...

20
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:17,077
I'm watching TV at night,
the only thing I can think about

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,646
is how there's a cake in my damn kitchen.

22
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,282
There's a cake in my kitchen.

23
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,651
When you live by yourself
you don't need a plate.

24
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,920
You've just got to get a fork.

25
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:28,121
[laughter]

26
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:33,993
And you'll eat half, and go, "Well, fuck,
I'm here." And you eat the other half.

27
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,963
And three months later
you're in drawstring britches.

28
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,531
[laughter]

29
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:43,103
When you go to buy jeans and they go,
"What size?" you go, "42, 16."

30
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,171
[laughter]

31
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,340
Those are capri pants for fat girls.

32
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:53,913
When you lean down to pull your boots on
and you black out, like, "What the fuck?"

33
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,415
[laughter]

34
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,718
...you have to start addressing shit.

35
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:05,325
I cannot remember the last time that
I physically washed my feet with my hands.

36
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,560
I just pour shampoo on them
and go like that.

37
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,696
[laughter]

38
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,133
You know, I'm just not that motivated
right now, folks.

39
00:02:13,566 --> 00:02:16,536
When you get married and, I don't know,
when you get divorced,

40
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,072
whoever tells you they take half...
they get it all.

41
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,541
If you live in this state
they get every bit of it.

42
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,143
I'm just letting you know.

43
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,912
My kids say, "Get a girlfriend."

44
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,681
Are you crazy?
I'm still paying for the last one.

45
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:33,419
If somebody came to me and went,
"You want pussy, or mac and cheese?"

46
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,054
I'd go, "Fuck...

47
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,526
I'm gonna go with mac and cheese."

48
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,461
[laughter]

49
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,463
It's just less work, you know?

50
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,232
Pussy is just exhausting.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,569
Isn't it? I mean, I like it,
don't get me wrong.

52
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,705
I just don't like what it's attached to,
90 percent of the time.

53
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:54,941
[laughter, whooping]

54
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:59,112
That was the problem with my ex-wife.
I liked it, she didn't care for it.

55
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,316
I tried to get her to eat it
in the hot tub one time, and...

56
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,019
she wouldn't touch it.

57
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,122
I don't blame her.
It's gamey. Tastes like duck.

58
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,190
[laughter]

59
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:13,493
Doesn't it? You're like:
"What the fuck? I can't tell.

60
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,397
What does it taste like?
Seagull or some shit? I can't tell."

61
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,898
[laughter]

62
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:22,435
That's why we eat it in the dark.
You know that, right?

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,072
Because if they saw us,
they would see us going,

64
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,976
"Oh, fuck! How long
do I got to do this shit?"

65
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,581
And they're like, "It's wet, isn't it?"
You're like, "Yeah."

66
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,849
[laughter]

67
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,586
"Yeah, it's wet because I'm
not swallowing this shit."

68
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,791
You breathe...
you breathe through your mouth.

69
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,295
It's the same technique you use
to pick up dog shit.

70
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,997
[laughter]

71
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:53,967
Isn't it?

72
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,970
When you pick up, you go,
"Oh, shit, oh, fuck."

73
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,708
That's going to be a topic of conversation
on the way home.

74
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,346
[female voice] "Do you hold your breath
when you lick my pussy?"

75
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,882
[male voice] "Fucking Rodney,
God damn it!"

76
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:16,322
"Do you hold your breath
when you lick my pussy?"

77
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:21,094
"Well, hell, mid-week,
I've got to go back to work.

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,062
I don't need that shit on my breath."

79
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,430
[laughter]

80
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:29,035
"But if it's Saturday and I'm hammered
I'll lick your butt. I don't give a fuck."

81
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,403
[laughter]

82
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,038
You go down there like a trucker.

83
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,239
[gargles]

84
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,446
That's the time you're glad that
pussy juice don't have purple dye in it.

85
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,783
Saturday night, you look like a clown.

86
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,451
[laughter]

87
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,821
"Have you been eating pussy?
It's all over your goddamn face."

88
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,425
[he sighs]

89
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:54,127
I'm not that motivated.

90
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,728
I don't have to worry.

91
00:04:55,795 --> 00:05:00,233
Not a lot of women are going, "I want
to fuck that fat little son of a bitch."

92
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,734
[laughter]

93
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:04,537
Except another fat little son of a bitch.

94
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,941
Which, by the way, are fun to fuck.

95
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:15,848
Now that old Rod's a fatty, I've had to...
well, you know, I've had a few fatties.

96
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,387
I was with this girl one night.
She was about 180. Real good-looking.

97
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,256
Five-two. One-eighty.

98
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,692
[laughter]

99
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,728
She's sitting on top of me
and she puts her hand on my forehead,

100
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,597
and leans over and presses,
and I'm like, "What the fuck?"

101
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,968
She goes, "I am going
to fuck the shit out of you."

102
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,371
I said, "I hope you do."

103
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,309
She goes, "I am going to tear
your little dick off with my vagina."

104
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,245
I said, "I dare you."

105
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:47,613
[laughter]

106
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,816
And she got to rocking back and forth.

107
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:53,186
And she had shaved all her shit,
but it was about two weeks earlier.

108
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,721
[laughter]

109
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:55,822
Yeah.

110
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:58,524
She had, like, a sailor beard
going on down there.

111
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,427
And it was rubbing against my stomach.

112
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:05,498
I'm like, "Whoa, slow the fuck down.
You're going to start a friction fire."

113
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,166
[laughter]

114
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,802
"You're going to burn a hole
in my goddamn stomach.

115
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,507
I need some Neosporin. I can barely keep
a hard-on, it's burning so much.

116
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:19,178
My leg has been asleep for 15 minutes.
Use the stirrups every now and then."

117
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:20,446
[laughter]

118
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:26,386
"I'm going to get some Neosporin,
and when I come back, I'm on top, chubby."

119
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,287
[laughter]

120
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:34,994
I was down here about two nights ago,
drinking with one of my buddies.

121
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,698
It's one of them bars where you sit
at the bar and see yourself in the mirror.

122
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,933
Get drunker as the night goes on.

123
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,537
And this drunk Christian woman
walked up to me.

124
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:46,973
Because there's a bunch in this town.

125
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,808
[laughter]

126
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,476
A lot of drunk Christian women.

127
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,180
She walked up to me
and introduced herself like this: "Hey!"

128
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,448
[hiccups]

129
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,251
"I know you.

130
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,253
I hope you're happy.

131
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,589
I hope you're happy
with those sick-ass jokes you tell,

132
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,659
because one of these days
you're going to meet your maker."

133
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:12,298
I couldn't tell if she was serious because
I run into a lot of drunk sons of bitches.

134
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:15,935
But it dawned on me real quick
that she was serious.

135
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:20,573
She sat down and told me one of these days
I was going to meet my maker.

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,108
I told her I was encouraged,

137
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,911
because I thought I might be going
straight to hell.

138
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,579
[laughter]

139
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,649
I had no idea I was going to get
a chance to explain myself.

140
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:35,154
Because I feel like I can talk my way
out of anything, given a damn chance.

141
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,324
Then she told me
how upset God was with me,

142
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:42,228
and I said, "How could I be so wrong,
if I was his idea?"

143
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,530
I'm not my fault.

144
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,204
Do you ever think that maybe God got tired
of stamping out the same old shit,

145
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,841
and thought, "Tonight, I'm going
to make something weird"?

146
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,643
[laughter]

147
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,814
When he was putting me together, he was
using different kinds of ingredients.

148
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,618
He had on big rubber gloves,
and it was late one night.

149
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:10,323
He was in his laboratory, somebody walked
in and interrupted him: "Hey, God."

150
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,792
And I got loose.
He went, "Fuck! Get that."

151
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,827
[laughter]

152
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,597
"It's got half a brain
and I didn't put a dick on it."

153
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,966
[laughter]

154
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,435
"If it gets loose, it will hate itself."

155
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,108
Imagine how long the damn line is,
to meet your maker.

156
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,980
"Has that fucker let anybody in yet?

157
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,917
I've been here four hours.
The line hasn't moved."

158
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,953
That's going to be
an anxiety-ridden line, isn't it?

159
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,489
Standing in that son of a bitch.
Good God!

160
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:45,458
"What's wrong?"
"I've got to shit."

161
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,029
"You can't shit outside.
You can only shit when you get in."

162
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,066
Then that moment
when you push through the turnstile

163
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:55,701
and it's just you and Him.

164
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,371
"How are you doing?

165
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,940
I've heard a lot about you.

166
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,744
I'm Rodney. I guess I should ask,
how much do you know?"

167
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:06,212
[laughter]

168
00:09:08,347 --> 00:09:10,550
I imagine God looking like Clint Eastwood.

169
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:12,818
You know, the real cool one from the '70s.

170
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,455
Where he sits with a toothpick
in his mouth and pulls it out,

171
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,157
and says, "I know everything."

172
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,727
We're going to be here a while.

173
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,296
[laughter]

174
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:26,599
I'll pull my pants down and point,
and He's going to go,

175
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,801
"Fuck, I wondered where you were.

176
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:34,206
Get in here, you were too quick.
I couldn't catch you when you ran off.

177
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,979
Billy, he's here. You know,
the one I told you about. Nothing there.

178
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,515
Get him a beanbag chair
and something to drink.

179
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,686
Tell him we're sorry
and tell him where the shitter is."

180
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,688
[laughter]

181
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,657
Everything we laugh at,
God has something to do with.

182
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,361
He created the penis,
stuck it on the first man.

183
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,698
Looked at it, stared, wondered
and pondered, and thought,

184
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,801
"Ah, fuck. Looks weird by itself.

185
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:05,371
I have to put something under it."

186
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,673
[laughter, whooping]

187
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,179
Wouldn't you like to have seen
the stuff He sketched out,

188
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:16,248
long before he decided
on what he decided on?

189
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,652
It must have been awful
for him to come to the conclusion

190
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:23,656
that a sack with two balls
and hair all over it was his best option.

191
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,491
[laughter]

192
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,929
Because at some point he went,
"Yeah, girls will love that."

193
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:32,131
[laughter]

194
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:36,669
I ain't met one that said, "Could you slap
those against my chin a little faster?"

195
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,541
"I must admit, you are a rare bird!

196
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:48,047
I might have to see you again, Darlene."

197
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,682
[laughter]

198
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,953
Aren't you glad he put it
where he put it, right here,

199
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,254
and not right here?

200
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,592
"You going to eat?"
"No, my balls stink."

201
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,963
"I gag every time I chew. Oh, fuck!

202
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,265
But I can lick them."

203
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:11,003
"Quit licking your balls
at the dinner table.

204
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,806
Your dick is getting hard
and we have guests."

205
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,408
[laughter]

206
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,145
That's what I did.

207
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,749
It's amazing that we stay together.
We're so different.

208
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:27,053
I grew up with three young sisters.
I know a lot about you women.

209
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:29,255
You bleed 84 days out of the year.

210
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,123
And you stink.

211
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:35,394
Now, I'm not being shitty.
I'm just telling you the truth.

212
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,899
I can tell whether a woman is
on her period just by the way she smells.

213
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,535
I know. I didn't want that fucking talent.

214
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,437
[laughter]

215
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,907
God gave me that. Who wants
that fucking talent? I'll give it to you.

216
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,544
You walk past me in a grocery store,
I'll go, "Yep, she's on it."

217
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,814
A lot of you going, "That's horseshit."

218
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,083
Flip on the lights,
I'll sniff a few of you out.

219
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,285
[laughter]

220
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:02,455
Be real still. If you cover with your hand
I'll sniff through it.

221
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,623
I can smell up to 70 feet, alright?

222
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:11,464
A lot of women over here are going,
"Dear God, please don't let this happen."

223
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,067
And I'm not going to embarrass you.

224
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,571
But there's a few of you,
right in this area right here.

225
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,806
Right out of the damn box,
I can smell you.

226
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:26,512
You bleed 84 days out of the year,
you don't even get dizzy. That's amazing.

227
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:30,116
I cut my finger on the onion chopper
and went, "What the fuck?"

228
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,550
[laughter]

229
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,186
We're not talking a finger prick
on an onion chopper,

230
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,889
we're talking about
a hatchet wound to the crotch.

231
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,961
That bleeds so much, you have to pack it
full of gauze to get it to go away.

232
00:12:42,027 --> 00:12:43,462
[laughter]

233
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:47,500
And you do. You pack that sucker
full of gauze and go get the kids.

234
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,803
You pack it full of gauze
and you go to the grocery store.

235
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,706
Because you're
an angry, bloody, fucking soldier.

236
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,708
[laughter]

237
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,844
I'm surprised more women don't say:

238
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,815
"I just can't take this shit.
I bleed. I stink. I want it gone.

239
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,017
If you can just fuck me in the ass..."

240
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:08,587
"Do you know how much I love you?"

241
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,523
[laughter]

242
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,960
"I know how much courage it took
for you to come to me and say that.

243
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,430
And I will fuck you in the ass...

244
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,467
until death do we part.

245
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:23,869
I love you."

246
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,607
I've seen childbirth
three times in person.

247
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,143
Something else men wouldn't tolerate.

248
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:35,414
That math equation will never be able
to be answered in your head.

249
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,051
The fact that you can take your thing
and stick it in her thing,

250
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,887
and squirt something on some thing,

251
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:45,124
and nine months later,
something squirts out of your twat

252
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,892
and costs a million dollars.

253
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,194
[laughter]

254
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,262
You don't think about that.

255
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,633
And then when it comes out
it's that long, and about that big around.

256
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,335
Right out of your twat.

257
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,871
Not a marble. I've seen that.

258
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,439
[laughter]

259
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,709
That looks effortless.

260
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,312
You've got to go...

261
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,148
You've got to go in line to see that.

262
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:14,486
Fellas, if you walk into the bedroom
with a little sandwich bag full of marbles

263
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,288
you're going to catch a little shit.

264
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,391
Hold them up, shake them at her.

265
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,595
[female voice] "What are you doing?"

266
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:27,533
[male voice] "Well, I was online yesterday
and something made my dick real hard.

267
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,837
So I was going to see
if you might want to participate."

268
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,540
"What is it?"

269
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:35,875
"Well...

270
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,678
See, I got these eight marbles
over at Walgreens.

271
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,816
I soaked them in hydrogen peroxide
so they're bacteria-free.

272
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,052
I was going to have you
stick them in your twat,

273
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,557
and have you spit them out one by one
with your little pussy muscle,

274
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,161
and I was going to position myself
where I could watch it,

275
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,930
and jack off on your forehead."

276
00:14:57,997 --> 00:14:59,865
[laughter]

277
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:03,903
"Doesn't that sound like fun?

278
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:12,745
I can kind of tell by the look on
your face, you're not real into it, so..."

279
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:13,946
[laughter]

280
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,583
"I'm going to go get myself a pop tart."

281
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,551
[laughter]

282
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,757
You cannot watch pornography
when you're married.

283
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,926
There's a couple of reasons.

284
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:31,497
Number one, your spouse cannot compete
with what's on the internet.

285
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,566
And nor should he ever have to.

286
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,936
[laughter]

287
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,873
If we believe the internet,

288
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,475
we have to believe
that every dick is a foot long.

289
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,479
And if that's the case,
I'm going to have to move to China.

290
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,515
[laughter]

291
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:52,017
[Chinese voice]
"You've got big dick, cowboy."

292
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,288
"Only here, Chingaling, only here.

293
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,658
Back in the States, I'm all balls."

294
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,427
[laughter]

295
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:07,266
What happens when you watch pornography
is, it's never enough.

296
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,668
Fellas, you know this.

297
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,670
You sick motherfuckers.

298
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,974
Because I'm one of you. It's never enough.

299
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,177
If you watch pornography,
it is never enough.

300
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,347
You might find something you like
and go back to it ten times.

301
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:24,183
But eventually, it ain't weird enough.

302
00:16:24,883 --> 00:16:26,618
It ain't weird enough. You know why?

303
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,255
Same part of your brain that operates
when you watch pornography:

304
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,726
same part of your brain that operates
when you get hooked on heroin.

305
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:34,893
Yeah.

306
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,462
I learned this in church.

307
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,630
[laughter]

308
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:41,867
That's the truth. Think about it.
Nobody starts with heroin.

309
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,470
You start with wine coolers,
work your way up.

310
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,140
Wine coolers, beer, whiskey,

311
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,175
pot, cocaine, pills...

312
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:53,479
After that you're shooting up,
you've lost maybe 70 pounds,

313
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:56,115
there's teeth missing,
you're in a dark alley,

314
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,983
and there might be a dick in your butt.

315
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,752
[laughter]

316
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,653
That's your only bargaining power.

317
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,290
"Did you bring my shit?"
"I brought your shit. Shut up."

318
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,496
Most of us stop short of that level,
for obvious reasons.

319
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,098
"Fuck that, I'm just going
to drink whiskey."

320
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,537
What happens when you watch
pornography, same deal.

321
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:21,607
It starts out innocent,
just like a wine cooler.

322
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:25,778
First, it's just some woman
sitting on the edge of a bath tub,

323
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,746
rubbing baby oil on her titty.

324
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,450
Your wife might even watch it with you.

325
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,952
"I know why you watch that.

326
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,121
She's got big titties, and I know you,

327
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,391
and she's pretty,
and she's rubbing baby oil all over her."

328
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,029
But eight months down the road,
your wife ain't there. She's at work.

329
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,665
You've been sitting behind the screen,

330
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,268
your breath smells like crackers
and grape juice.

331
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,971
All you've been doing
is snacking and jacking.

332
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:55,007
[laughter]

333
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,944
You're not looking at some woman
rubbing oil on her titties.

334
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,915
You're looking at a four-foot Asian
with a catfish stuck in her ass.

335
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:06,185
The tail is wagging,
as it struggles to stay alive.

336
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,122
Even you can't believe how weird you are.
"What the fuck is wrong with me?"

337
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,356
[laughter]

338
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,025
Jesus. Fuck!

339
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,229
Your wife is the same way.
"What is wrong with you?

340
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,999
We've been married 20 years.
You come in the bedroom. I'm naked.

341
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:24,870
You don't get a hard-on. What the fuck
is that goddamn fish doing in here?"

342
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,706
[laughter]

343
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,580
Somehow you find a way to make it work.

344
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,917
Every one of you bastards has got
some weird shit you do in the bedroom

345
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,986
that the PTA don't know nothing about.

346
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,357
You're all bubbles at school.

347
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,161
"How you doing? I had it in my ass
about two hours ago."

348
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,863
You don't say that, but you did.

349
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,665
I know you.

350
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,202
You find a way to make it work,
and you should.

351
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,605
There's nothing on the other side.

352
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,773
I'm telling you, I'm there right now.

353
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,444
You know what's on the other side?
Young and dumb, and old and crazy.

354
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:10,849
There's these young girls out there going,
"I just want to travel the world."

355
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:13,819
Well, you work at Arby's.
It's going to be a while.

356
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,621
[laughter]

357
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:20,792
Then you've got middle-aged women
whose husband ran off and left them,

358
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,028
because he thought the grass was greener,

359
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:25,364
only to find out it was poison ivy.

360
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,199
[laughter]

361
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,336
And she's gained 30 pounds since college,
and she's just a basket case.

362
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:34,072
"I don't know if anybody is
going to love me again.

363
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:36,508
I don't know if anybody is
going to love me again."

364
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,178
Well, not with that attitude, Sybil.

365
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:42,080
Put down the donut, get on a treadmill.

366
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,616
Life's going on, here we go.
Pull it together.

367
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,153
It makes no sense.

368
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:52,124
You have the most powerful
bargaining chip on the planet.

369
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,159
You have a pussy.

370
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:55,527
[women whoop]

371
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,564
Yes. See, only two of you know about it.

372
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,365
[laughter]

373
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,535
The rest of you act like,
"What did he say? What?"

374
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:08,240
If I had what you had, why...
I'd be a whore!

375
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,209
[laughter]

376
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,881
I would walk into my apartment complex
and go, "I'm not paying my rent."

377
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,084
"We're going to throw you out."
I'd say, "You sure about that?"

378
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,119
[laughter]

379
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,559
And I would fiddle with my clitoris.

380
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,195
[laughter]

381
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,965
"Well, I guess you can stay
for another six months."

382
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:40,272
You can't pull your balls out
and get a free month. It ain't happening.

383
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,341
[laughter]

384
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,144
You're so lucky.

385
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,047
As a woman you could have
no arms and no legs,

386
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:53,018
and your head could be on backwards,
and somebody would still fuck you.

387
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,088
That's how lucky you are.

388
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,091
As a man in the same predicament,

389
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:01,994
all you could do is rock back and forth
and go, "Why?"

390
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:04,162
Why?

391
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,298
Hello?

392
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:11,436
If you have giant tits
you have an advantage in life.

393
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:13,372
Even retarded people know this.

394
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,140
[women whoop]

395
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,943
If you have a D-cup size or bigger,

396
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,246
your face could have caught on fire
when you were seven,

397
00:21:22,214 --> 00:21:26,285
and your brother could have broke a shovel
trying to put that motherfucker out,

398
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,455
and you're still going to be OK.

399
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:35,627
Somebody would go, "Dry them tears,
that fire didn't get them nipples.

400
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,362
[laughter]

401
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,465
God damn,
it took your lips off though, didn't it?

402
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,702
You look like a barracuda."

403
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,338
[laughter]

404
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:50,342
I know a lot of women out there:
"But we want equal pay!"

405
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,580
You could have had ten times the pay
if you used your noggin and your puss!

406
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,019
If every one of you girls
locked arms on the planet,

407
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,722
and stood on top of Mount Kilimanjaro,

408
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,457
wherever the fuck that is,

409
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,826
and hollered down:

410
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:12,264
"We ain't coming down until we get
ten times the amount of pay as men get!"

411
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,867
It might take six or eight months,

412
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,771
but eventually you would hear us
at the bottom of the mountain.

413
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:26,144
Alright!

414
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,846
[laughter]

415
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,381
Fuck!

416
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,385
Come on down!

417
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,854
And bring that pussy with you.

418
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,825
Alright, men, listen.

419
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,727
They're coming.

420
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:46,331
When they get down here, grab one
and go fuck the shit out of them.

421
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:50,068
When the last man is done,

422
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:54,039
we're going to tell them we were
just kidding about all that pay shit.

423
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,607
[laughter]

424
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,444
They're going to get agitated
and run back up that mountain.

425
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,481
We're going to have seven months
of peace and tranquility,

426
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,217
fishing, golfing, hunting,

427
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,154
and then we're going to figure out
some idea to fuck them for Christmas.

428
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,555
How does that sound?

429
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,357
[whooping, cheering]

430
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,825
You with me?

431
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:16,294
That's right.

432
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,068
These are jokes. If you learn anything,
it's a goddamn accident.

433
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,806
You girls are pissed:
"See how they are? This is bullshit.

434
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:31,209
We come off the mountain, they fuck us,
and then fuck us again."

435
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,544
[laughter]

436
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,313
Yeah, pretty much.

437
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,418
The fact of the matter is,
we can't live without you.

438
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,655
We like you. A lot.

439
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:47,292
Here's one thing we'd like you to do.

440
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,363
We'd like you to quit trying to maintain
your birth weight of eight pounds.

441
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,331
[laughter]

442
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:57,302
Society has dictated to you that you've
got to look like a goddamn skeleton.

443
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,139
No man I know, love, or care about,
or respect, wants to fuck a skeleton.

444
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,808
[cheering, whistling]

445
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:04,509
Or...

446
00:24:04,976 --> 00:24:09,347
some muscled-up woman who looks
like a goddamn track star named Kevin.

447
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:14,486
"Hey, Bill, how's that girl you're dating?
That one that looks like Kevin."

448
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,455
[laughter]

449
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:18,423
"How's that?"
"Yucky."

450
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,659
"Fucking yucky, isn't it? Fucking yucky."

451
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,996
Yuck. A man goes down a raft,
he likes handles.

452
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:26,998
Likes to hold on. It's more fun that way.

453
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:31,136
Goes down a river, he wants
a raft with handles, right here.

454
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:34,239
He wants to reach round
above your bush and hold your cooch.

455
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:40,946
Another thing. Quit shaving your twat.
After 40 it's beat to shit.

456
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,514
You need hair on that.

457
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,382
[laughter]

458
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:46,818
After 40, it looks like
a sea urchin out of a shell.

459
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,987
You need some fucking hair, alright?

460
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,357
It don't need to go down your leg
to your ankles,

461
00:24:52,424 --> 00:24:55,393
but it can be shaved
in a fucking triangle, like the '70s.

462
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,931
You goddamn older women: "I shaved my..."

463
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,467
Fuck! Stop. Fucking stop.

464
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,336
[laughter]

465
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:08,440
You're always on a diet.

466
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,643
"You want some cake?"
"No. I am dieting."

467
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:15,146
"Well, I didn't know.
I saw you eat pecan pie last night."

468
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,415
"You motherfucker!"

469
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,818
[laughter]

470
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:25,056
I can't tell if you're mad
because you got caught, or what.

471
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,194
And women take that shit seriously.

472
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:33,331
You better be able to recognize
when they've been dieting, even for a day.

473
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:37,569
[female voice] "You son of a bitch,
can't you see I'm starving?

474
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,972
I didn't eat a goddamn thing all day.
I am fucking shaking."

475
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,009
"Well, go eat something."
"No! That's how I got like this."

476
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,011
[laughter]

477
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:52,551
You come home with ten Lean Cuisines,
fired up from Doctor Oz,

478
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,419
and throw them on the counter.

479
00:25:55,086 --> 00:25:56,922
"What are you going to do with those?"

480
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,725
"I'm going to try to diet,
if I can get some support in this house."

481
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,694
[laughter]

482
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,301
"What about that trampoline in front of
our closet that you never jumped on?

483
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,837
When are you going to hop on that,
Cheryl Tiegs?"

484
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,906
[laughter]

485
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:18,243
"I stub my toe on it every morning,
getting dressed."

486
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,048
"You know what? This is exactly
what I'm talking about, right here.

487
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,584
This is why I can't lose weight."

488
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,589
"Are you fucking serious right now?"

489
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:32,390
[laughter]

490
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,628
"I'm the reason you're chubarilla?"

491
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:42,334
Now, you don't say that, because
you've got a goddamn brain in your head.

492
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,905
When you've been married a long time,
there's only a few words.

493
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,039
And these are them:

494
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:50,408
"I know. You're right.

495
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,611
I should have listened better.

496
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,813
I'll get the kids.

497
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,448
Don't worry.

498
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,650
You look pretty.

499
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,085
I love you.

500
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,454
Go look in my wallet."

501
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,424
Yeah. You know why you know that?

502
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,293
Because when you were young,

503
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,463
youthful pride had no filter
when you argued with your wife.

504
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,164
You would go, "Fuck you!"

505
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,433
You ever say "Fuck you"
to the woman you love?

506
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,603
Yeah, isn't that magical,
how that works out?

507
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,405
[laughter]

508
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,308
When you say "Fuck you" to your wife,
or the woman you love,

509
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:26,745
you have just booked yourself a ticket
to No-Pussy-Ville.

510
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,014
And it's a long walk.

511
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,617
Twelve hundred miles,
and your buddies are there.

512
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,153
It's like The Island of Misfit Toys.

513
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,424
You go to No-Pussy-Ville,
you come back a changed man.

514
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,259
When you come back, you are changed.

515
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,299
[laughter]

516
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,305
Hi.

517
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:56,675
[laughter]

518
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:01,546
Look, I'm sorry that I said "Fuck you"
six months ago.

519
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,551
I meant to say, "I love you,"
and it came out, "Fuck you."

520
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,319
[laughter]

521
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,422
And I'm sorry.

522
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,691
I'll never do it again.

523
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:15,226
And she'll tell you, you are sorry.

524
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:17,729
"You think you're going
to waltz in and apologize?

525
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,598
And hop back on me
and get inside Momma's little biscuit?"

526
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,233
[laughter]

527
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,439
"I didn't say anything about a biscuit.

528
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,842
"Well, that's good
because you're not getting any of this

529
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:32,844
until you're back in this: my heart."

530
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,416
"How long is that going to fucking take?"

531
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,452
[laughter]

532
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,990
Instead you say to her,
"I'm going to diet with you."

533
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,461
And when you say it you're like,
"Why the hell did I say that?"

534
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,396
Men don't like to diet.

535
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:55,467
We don't care if our buddies are fat.
Our fat buddies are our funnest buddies.

536
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:58,837
Because they're happy. You know why?
Because they're fucking full.

537
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,605
[laughter]

538
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,909
Yeah. They think diabetes is an island
in the fucking Caribbean somewhere.

539
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,647
"Me and Laura are going down to Diabetes
in June. You want to go?"

540
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,583
[laughter]

541
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,790
Men don't tell each other we're fat.
We don't go:

542
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:21,826
"Jim, God damn,
eat a chicken salad, fat-ass.

543
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,595
You look like hell."

544
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,031
It's not until our women tell us,
"You're fat,"

545
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,833
that a man goes, "What?

546
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,836
How long?"

547
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:35,907
"A long time."

548
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,676
"Why didn't you tell me?"

549
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:44,249
"Because we walk past the same mirror
every morning, you dumb-ass. That's why."

550
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:45,884
[laughter]

551
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,987
Men, you don't know you're fat.
I'm going to help you.

552
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:51,856
You go home tonight,
lay down on your bed. No pillow.

553
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,592
Alright? It's important, no pillow.

554
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,128
Like this, flat. Just like this.

555
00:29:58,062 --> 00:29:59,564
This is how you're going to lay.

556
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,099
Look straight at the ceiling,

557
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,135
and when you're laying down,
it's as skinny as you can get.

558
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,104
It's as skinny as you can get.

559
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:09,908
Have your wife come in,

560
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,845
and she's going to get up on her elbow
and jack you off, like this.

561
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,715
If while you're there,
out of your peripheral vision,

562
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,951
you can't see her hand or arm moving...

563
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:22,120
[laughter]

564
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:24,155
...that's how you know you're a fat-ass.

565
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,890
[cheering]

566
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:27,959
Yeah.

567
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,762
Oh, shit. Alright.

568
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:34,499
Show's over! Son of a bitch.

569
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,535
Another way you can tell you're fat:

570
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,705
when you've got to use your legs
to throw yourself up, like that.

571
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:42,974
[he chuckles]

572
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:43,942
God damn.

573
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,912
I've got to quit telling stories
where I lay down.

574
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,781
[laughter]

575
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:54,586
"We saw him. That fucker laid down,
never got up again. We had to leave."

576
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,857
Look,

577
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:02,126
there's moments in marriage
where you look at each other and go,

578
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,729
"I ought to kill you
in your goddamn sleep."

579
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,499
That is completely normal.

580
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:14,005
It is normal. It's a feeling.
It will pass. Do not act on it.

581
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:19,244
There's going to be a moment, fellas,
walking with your wife..

582
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,912
You might even be at the zoo.

583
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:25,516
And her shorts are too short, and you
notice that her ass is goddamn gigantic.

584
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,588
And you also notice that you're married.
It comes to you: "I'm married to that."

585
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,524
And you're going to get
really, really sad.

586
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,761
You're not even going to want
to look at the animals.

587
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,365
"Honey, come look at the monkeys."
"No, God damn, woman."

588
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:45,570
Then you go home, look in the mirror,
and you're not much of a prize either.

589
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,173
And you're going to find a way
to love her again.

590
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,511
You probably fantasize
about what's out there.

591
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,915
"Something younger."
You don't want that shit. I've had it.

592
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:02,420
When you get divorced, it's like
the Coast Guard hovers over your house.

593
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,023
Nobody sees divorce coming.

594
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,193
You might think about it,
but you don't see it coming.

595
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,997
Helicopter flies over your house.
You're mowing.

596
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,401
A guy drops down, grabs you,
pulls you up in the helicopter.

597
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:18,169
He slaps the fuck out of you,

598
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,640
puts a lifejacket on you, flies you to
the middle of the ocean, throws you out.

599
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:26,077
And you just swim. You don't know
what the fuck just happened.

600
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:29,547
You've just been taken out
of your whole life. Can't see land.

601
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:33,151
You make the dumbest decisions
you'll ever make during this time.

602
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,321
Something floats by, you eat it,
only to find out it's a turd.

603
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:37,889
[laughter]

604
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,759
These are the kind of things you do.

605
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,795
You drink more than you normally drink.

606
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:47,098
During this time, I met a girl
who was 20 years younger.

607
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,566
We went out to clubs...

608
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,134
[loud booming]

609
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,537
"What the fuck am I doing
in this goddamn place?"

610
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:58,676
There's nothing you have in common
with a woman 20 years your junior.

611
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:02,313
You know why? Because when
you're 47 years old, you've lived life.

612
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,382
You've been to funerals, weddings...

613
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,919
You cry at a Hallmark commercial.
They look at you: "Why are you crying?"

614
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,388
"Because I've lived life.
You're fucking 12."

615
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,423
[laughter]

616
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,663
I would share a good life story
with her, at dinner.

617
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,766
She'd look at me like a hung moon,
and then go...

618
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,236
I was looking for something else from her.

619
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:29,807
The reason you're with your wife is
because she says something you respect.

620
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,111
She has an opinion that reminds you
that you're a fucking idiot,

621
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,613
and you're like, "Damn it,
I need her in my life."

622
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,652
But we're sitting there, and she would go:
"You've just got to stay positive.

623
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:46,357
I'd say, "God damn,
you dug deep for that one, didn't you?"

624
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,625
[laughter]

625
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,328
It was all I could do,
not to take the fork out of her hand

626
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,930
and just stab her in the goddamn forehead.

627
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,565
[laughter]

628
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,368
Protect other men
from that kind of stupidity.

629
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,039
But then we would go home.

630
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,042
And she would take off all her clothes.

631
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:08,780
[sings choral melody]

632
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:13,217
[sings in Latin]

633
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:25,530
[sings high note, people cheer]

634
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,006
Her skin was not yet reptilian, like mine.

635
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:40,578
You do not want to be dating after 45.
You're introducing more than yourself.

636
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:44,882
You're thinking, "When do I tell her about
the toenail that looks like a corn chip?"

637
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,250
[laughter]

638
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:49,854
"Or the mole on my back
that has an Afro on top of it?"

639
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,957
Yeah, it's not pleasant.

640
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,894
The woman you have now, she goes,
"Look at that nasty goddamn toe."

641
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:59,730
She'll still fuck you
after you leave the beach.

642
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,134
But a new one goes,
"Oh! No, can't do that. Fuck you."

643
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,174
Her skin was not yet reptilian.
It was perfect.

644
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,544
At 25, you're gorgeous.
Her tits went, "What?"

645
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,415
Totally different than the ones
I was used to that went,

646
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,817
"Hey, Rodney, how you doing there, buddy?"

647
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,853
[laughter]

648
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,522
"We've been hanging around
waiting on you."

649
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,360
Like big dog ears hanging off,
with a nipple right at the end.

650
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,601
I reached between her legs, it felt like a
baby horse taking a peanut out of my hand.

651
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,002
I went, "What the...

652
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:43,708
That thing's starving.
I'm going to get some more peanuts."

653
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,977
[laughter]

654
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,183
She said to me, "Lets fuck."

655
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,952
My dick heard her and went, "No!"

656
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,523
[high voice]
"No, I don't want to fuck.

657
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:02,293
I don't want to fuck.

658
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:04,929
I'm scared."

659
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:10,001
She said, "Is something wrong?"
and I started to cry.

660
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,038
When you're on a girl
and your dick doesn't work,

661
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,340
you have to cry
or they think you're queer.

662
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,209
[laughter]

663
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:24,882
I called the doctor I play golf with.
I said, "Merlon, meet me at IHOP."

664
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,918
This was the next morning.

665
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,554
I tell him the story,
he gives me a smoker's laugh.

666
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,389
[wheezing laugh]

667
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:35,826
He says, "Are you still taking
that medicine I gave you?"

668
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,762
Two months earlier on the golf course,

669
00:36:37,828 --> 00:36:40,665
out of the back seat of his car
he throws me a bottle of pills.

670
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,801
"Take these for a while.
You won't give a shit about nothing."

671
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:46,537
I took them.

672
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,508
Then two weeks later
I watched my dog get run over and went...

673
00:36:50,575 --> 00:36:52,476
[chuckles goofily]

674
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,513
Then I went, "Fuck,
these motherfuckers are serious."

675
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,948
[laughter]

676
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,150
You don't give a shit about nothing.

677
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:03,955
But one of the side-effects
is that your dick gets cerebral palsy.

678
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,025
It just lays on your ball sack,

679
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:11,829
like it's a beanbag chair,
and smokes little cigarettes.

680
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,632
[stoner voice]
"What's going on, man?

681
00:37:17,268 --> 00:37:19,170
I don't fuck no more, man.

682
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,107
I just sit here, man."

683
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,676
Yeah. Not fun.

684
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,779
He said, "Cut the dose,
I'll call in some Viagra."

685
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:32,817
I said, "Merlon, I know you and your wife.
I've had dinner at your house.

686
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:37,121
I'm not going to be Sunday night funnies
over how Rodney's on weenie pills.

687
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,322
Fuck off."

688
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:42,526
He took a hunk out of his sausage
and went, "Suit yourself."

689
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:47,098
I said, "If you call them in,
what time will they be ready?"

690
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,866
[laughter]

691
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:52,069
Men, there comes a time
in a lot of your lives,

692
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:54,338
some of you in here, maybe many,

693
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,873
where the doctor says to you,

694
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,443
"Jim, you're just going to have
to take a pill to make your dick work."

695
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,614
When a man hears this,

696
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,883
it is a day of reckoning.

697
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,320
It is a three-day stare
out a fucking window.

698
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:21,299
You think to yourself, "Maybe I ought
to just buy a metal detector

699
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,801
and start collecting rocks
and stupid shit."

700
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,437
[laughter]

701
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,540
And at some point
you pull yourself up by the bootstraps,

702
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,943
and you drive down to Walgreens
and you pick up your medicine.

703
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:36,113
You drive through, you don't walk in.

704
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,150
Nobody walks in for weenie pills.

705
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:45,556
"Howdy, girls. The name's Dick Don't-Work.
Maybe you've heard of me.

706
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,828
Give me 20 minutes. I'm in a Lexus
out front. I'm going to chip a tooth."

707
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,097
[laughter]

708
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,133
No, nobody walks in. You drive through.

709
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,270
And you hope you don't know
the pharmacist, like I do.

710
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,373
Richard, 67 years old, sitting in there,

711
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,276
and I'm thinking,
"I'll pull in, get right out."

712
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,978
He sees me.
There must be 15 people in there.

713
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:11,515
He holds up the sack and goes,
"Caught up with you, didn't it, boy?"

714
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:12,950
[laughter]

715
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:17,254
And through the window he sees me go,
"Fuck you, Richard, fuck you!

716
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,191
Fuck you, Richard!"

717
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,694
I pulled out of there, hit the bricks,

718
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:26,964
and just tear the side-view mirror
right off my truck.

719
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,466
Ran over it with my back tire.

720
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:32,269
I pull into the parking lot
to read the side-effects.

721
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:34,905
"Heart palpitations, dizziness, death."

722
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:36,640
I thought, "Fuck, I can handle it."

723
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,442
[laughter]

724
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:43,047
Then I saw how much I paid for it.
A hundred and eighty-seven dollars.

725
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,917
I thought, "God damn, I must have
a four-year supply of this shit."

726
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:50,721
I pulled out the bottle. You didn't
even have to count. There were eight.

727
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:52,289
I was like, "What the...

728
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,827
Is there chewing gum,
or ointment, or something?"

729
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,266
I thought, "Surely he got sidetracked
and didn't put them all in there."

730
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,835
So hell, I pulled back around.

731
00:40:05,936 --> 00:40:09,106
"Get over here."
He comes up the window. "What is it?"

732
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,208
I said, "There's eight.

733
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,511
She's 25.

734
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:15,546
Not 75.

735
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:20,885
You send me home with eight, I'll be back
at 6:30, throw eight more back in there."

736
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:22,586
[laughter]

737
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,990
He said, "You can't eat them like that.
They'll kill you."

738
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,659
I said, "Do you just eat one a month?"

739
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,629
He said, "No, eat one
every time you want to do it.

740
00:40:33,063 --> 00:40:35,633
You had better know
when you're going to do it, too."

741
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,768
Yeah, that last part is important.

742
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:40,171
[laughter]

743
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,807
If you're at the bar
and you've got it in a holster,

744
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:45,376
and it's about to go down,
you start chewing it up.

745
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,312
Stay another hour,
you have to eat another

746
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:51,048
and it's going to cost you 50 dollars
to fuck somebody.

747
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,483
[laughter]

748
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:00,357
The good news is, women in their 50s
and older don't care about shit like this.

749
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,426
They're just glad something exists.

750
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:06,297
They will tell you, "I might want some
of that dick of yours in about 45 minutes.

751
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:10,000
So if you want to chew your pill,
I'll fix you a glass of wine.

752
00:41:10,568 --> 00:41:12,236
How does that sound?"

753
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:19,009
[laughter]

754
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:30,187
With young girls, no warning. They might
want to fuck by the cantaloupe at Reser's.

755
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,924
You can't eat that shit fast enough.
"Oh, fuck."

756
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:39,730
They need an epipen of that shit,
where you go...

757
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,999
"Is this what you want?

758
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:45,469
I think it's what you've been wanting."

759
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,071
Yeah.

760
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,212
These young girls have seen pornography.

761
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,848
It's on their phone.
Don't let them fool you.

762
