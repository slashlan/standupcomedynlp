1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:10,886
America's public enemy number one
in the United States is drug abuse.

2
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:14,306
<i>In order to fight and defeat this enemy,</i>

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,560
it is necessary to wage
a new all-out offensive.

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,689
<i>We have not only the responsibility
but the authority</i>

5
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>to see that we wage this offensive
effectively and in a coordinated way.</i>

6
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,280
Finally, in order for this program
to be effective,

7
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,533
<i>the American people all join in it.</i>

8
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>Brooklyn,
give it up for the Lucas Brothers!</i>

9
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,584
- Sorry for walking around you.
- No, it's all good.

10
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:26,420
- How are you guys doing?
- You guys all right?

11
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,504
You all right?

12
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,924
- Cool.
- Yeah.

13
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,388
You're probably wondering
why we got all this shit up here.

14
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,472
Yeah.

15
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,310
- It's Richard Nixon.
- Yep. It's Richard.

16
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,772
Sir Richard. Thirty-seventh President
of the United States.

17
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:46,857
Yep.

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,942
- He was an asshole.
- Yes, he was.

19
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,903
- An asshole.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:56,658
We like to start all of our sets
by saying, "Fuck Richard Nixon"

21
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,037
- because it gives us motivation.
- That's right.

22
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,165
So, fuck Richard Nixon.

23
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,585
Fuck him.

24
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,966
You're probably wondering
why we hate him so much.

25
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,679
One reason: The War on Drugs, man.

26
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,933
Or, as we like to call it, "The War
on Niggas Who Just Want to Have Fun."

27
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:23,018
That's right.

28
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,937
That's all we want to do.

29
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,398
I mean, if white women can have fun,
why can't we?

30
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,775
We can have fun, too.

31
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,071
- We're niggas.
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,491
We've done a lot of drugs,
and we've had a lot of fun.

33
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,575
That's right.

34
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,496
But you can't do all types of drugs.

35
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,456
No. All drugs aren't created equal.

36
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,540
That's right.

37
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,585
- Abraham Lincoln said that.
- That's right, man.

38
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,962
But all drugs aren't created equal.

39
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:55,008
We did shrooms a year ago
for the very first time.

40
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,134
Yeah.

41
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,928
And here's a rule of thumb:

42
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,680
You should never do shrooms
with a dude who looks like you.

43
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:01,890
I'm telling you.

44
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,192
- Some weird shit.
- It was terrible.

45
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,528
It was weird. It was weird.

46
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,574
- Stick to weed.
- That's right.

47
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,202
That's right.

48
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,122
- We smoke a lot of weed.
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:31,128
One of our favorite things to do
is to smoke weed on the job.

50
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,171
- That's what we like doing.
- Mm-hmm.

51
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,466
Because it's a sure-fire way
to get fired, right?

52
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,469
- Jobs don't like when you smoke.
- No.

53
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,555
Like, we worked for a cable company,

54
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:45,100
and every time during our lunch break,
we'd smoke weed.

55
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,895
And one time, the boss caught us,
and he fired us.

56
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,773
And the weird thing is he fired us
at the same time

57
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:54,151
for the same exact reason.

58
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,570
And you don't want to get fired like that.

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,866
Because not only are you getting fired,

60
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,035
but it's kind of like you're watching
yourself get fired in 3-D.

61
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,457
- You gotta put glasses on.
- It's terrible.

62
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:14,880
That's not the first time
we faced twin discrimination.

63
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,964
Mm-mm.

64
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:18,258
Not the first.

65
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,219
People don't know how to react
when they see twins.

66
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,929
- No.
- They go crazy.

67
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,140
We were in the supermarket,
looking for some Jell-O.

68
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,224
Yep.

69
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:31,772
And we were just about to pick it out,
and then some dude came out of nowhere,

70
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:35,192
and he was, like, "Yo, you guys have
a stick of Doublemint gum?"

71
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,114
That's right. That's what he said.

72
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,576
Now, I know that sounds
like an innocent question to most people.

73
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,663
- But to twins, it's mad disrespectful.
- Absolutely.

74
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,501
So, we were about to check this nigga.

75
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,587
And I think that he saw
that we were angry,

76
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,465
so he tried to, like,
calm the situation down.

77
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,343
He was, like, "Yo, I'm sorry
if I offended you guys.

78
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:05,305
It's just, in the commercials,
twins always have gum.

79
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,933
In those Doublemint gum commercials,
they have gum,

80
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,893
so I figured you two guys had a stick."

81
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,854
- That's shitty logic.
- Yeah.

82
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,317
And why is this dude taking commercials
so seriously?

83
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,946
Does he do that with everything?
You know what I mean?

84
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,157
Does he go up to quirky white women
and ask for Progressive Insurance?

85
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,203
- I like that.
- Should we try another one?

86
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,205
Let's try another.
You want to try one? All right.

87
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,167
Does he go up to white babies
and ask for E-Trade stock advice?

88
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,421
Huh.

89
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,050
So, I'm glad we're comedians, man.

90
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,511
I mean, I couldn't imagine
working any other job,

91
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:47,055
because we always just get fired
from everything.

92
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,349
And we've spent a lot of time
in unemployment.

93
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,562
I think we've figured out a lot of
interesting things to do in unemployment.

94
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,314
We like to watch Deion Sanders
hip-hop videos.

95
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,191
Mm-hmm. He only made one.

96
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,277
He only made one,
so we watch one on a loop.

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,738
Yeah, but it's a classic.
It's a classic in its genre.

98
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,700
I mean, Deion was...
He was dropping some juice.

99
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,493
- He was ahead of his time.
- He was.

100
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,288
You may never hear that ever again,
but he was.

101
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,081
Prime Time!

102
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,874
- Prime Time.
- Prime Time.

103
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,920
He said this one thing in the video.
What was it? What did he say?

104
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,380
It was crazy. It was an ad-lib.

105
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:25,760
He was, like, "I'm gonna turn
my library cards into credit cards."

106
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,061
- We don't know what that means.
- We don't know.

107
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,855
We're not gonna front. We don't know.

108
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,443
We've been trying to figure that shit out
since we first heard it.

109
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,694
That's right.

110
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,197
And it's a baffling line
for a number of reasons.

111
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:50,452
First and foremost, we all know
Deion Sanders doesn't read, right?

112
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,953
He doesn't read.

113
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:55,290
Doesn't read.

114
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,336
But assuming that he does read
and he's an avid library fan...

115
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,007
Yeah. If everybody
followed that principle,

116
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,470
that would bankrupt America.
You know what I mean? Like...

117
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:13,141
Plus, he wants money. Why does he...
I don't know.

118
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,852
The name of the song
was "Must Be the Money."

119
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,479
Why is he talking about credit? That...

120
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,109
Just talk about money. You don't
even have to mention credit cards.

121
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,612
I just don't get it, man.

122
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,657
- Let's smoke on it.
- Okay.

123
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,741
Okay.

124
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,619
- We'll smoke on it, figure it out.
- We'll figure it out.

125
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,038
You know the worst thing about working?

126
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,291
- Coworkers.
- Mm-hmm. Absolutely.

127
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,753
- I guess you're kind of my coworker.
- I guess I am kind of your coworker.

128
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:46,883
But, nah, they're the worst, man,
because we were writing on this TV show.

129
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,802
- Shitty show.
- Shitty show.

130
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,221
We can't name it now
because they'll sue us.

131
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,431
But we were writing on this shit,

132
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:57,936
and one of our co-writers complained
all the time.

133
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,439
And we had a long day,
it was, like, a 15-hour day,

134
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,609
and he was, like,
"I can't do this job anymore, you know?

135
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,697
They got us working like slaves, man.
We're working like slaves."

136
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:14,452
And what was weird
is that for, like, the last five hours,

137
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:19,040
we were just talking about Steve Harvey
and whether or not his mustache is dope.

138
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,458
Like, that's all we did.

139
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:26,589
That would be a dope form of slavery,
if that... if that was it.

140
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,384
But it got us to thinking, man.

141
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,512
You ever wonder how slaves complained
about their job?

142
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,223
You ever wonder that?
Because they had to complain,

143
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,558
- because that shit was terrible.
- Yeah.

144
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,352
But they didn't say
they were working like slaves,

145
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,937
because that would be redundant.

146
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,609
- That's true.
- Yeah.

147
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,030
We imagine some slaves
were working on a pyramid.

148
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,616
You know, working.
Working their asses off.

149
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,286
You know, three-hour...
How long you think they were?

150
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,538
- Twenty-four-hour days.
- Twenty-four-hour days.

151
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,294
- And one slave flipped.
- Lost it.

152
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,172
He lost his shit. He was, like, "Fuck!

153
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:11,259
This Pharaoh got me working like...

154
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,524
- all these niggas around me."
- Yeah.

155
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,278
- That's excellent.
- Oh, thank you.

156
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,202
Money, weed and bitches.

157
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,543
- Pretty dope when rappers say it.
- That's right.

158
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,547
Even doper
if it was the first three words

159
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,467
that Jesus Christ said
after his resurrection.

160
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,763
"Money, weed and bitches. I'm back, baby."

161
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,311
"Let's go save humanity."

162
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,147
I was gonna say, "Let's kill some Romans."

163
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,857
Oh, that would've been good.

164
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,067
Well, he didn't kill Romans.

165
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,945
- Oh, I guess Christians killed Romans.
- That's right.

166
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:15,657
I get it. I get it. I'm sorry.

167
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,244
It's all right. You'll get them next time.

168
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,498
- There will be no next time.
- That's right.

169
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:28,878
We struggle...
Well, we used to struggle with money.

170
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:32,465
Mm-hmm. No, we used to struggle
with money for sure.

171
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,469
And we used to have a very acrimonious
relationship with banks.

172
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,887
Yes.

173
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,931
It wasn't a good relationship.

174
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:45,395
No, no. Like, we went to the bank one time
and looked at our account,

175
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,897
and it had $3 in it.

176
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,401
- That's a $1.50 apiece.
- That's right.

177
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,406
Or at least that's what we thought.

178
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,284
It was $3 with a parentheses around it.

179
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,746
- Which means something totally different.
- Yeah.

180
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,334
It means you owe the bank $3.

181
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,879
But when we first saw it,

182
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:14,507
we thought the bank was trying to protect
our last $3.

183
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,473
We thought it was a force field
for broke niggas.

184
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,558
Yeah.

185
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,563
And we gave 'em a stick of Doublemint gum
to say thank you.

186
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:36,738
Here's the problem with America.
It's income inequality.

187
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,864
I think that's the problem.

188
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,283
I think they need to restructure
how we pay people.

189
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,369
Like, football players,
they get guaranteed contracts, right?

190
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,915
So, they'll get $100 million,
but they guarantee you, like, 40 million.

191
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,834
- I think they should do that for teachers.
- Absolutely.

192
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,922
Teachers should get guaranteed contracts.
It's about fucking time, right?

193
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,257
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Yeah. Of course. Of course.

194
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,552
That's why if we were able
to overthrow the government

195
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,473
and become twin dictators,

196
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,560
that would be our first order of business.

197
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,146
- We would... What would we do?
- Forcibly round up...

198
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,940
- All the teachers.
- Yes.

199
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,360
Then we would bring them
to a room like this.

200
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,444
Like this.

201
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,197
And we would be, like,
"Teachers of America,

202
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:23,076
we know you guys have suffered,

203
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:29,123
so we are going to pay you $100 million."

204
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,959
- That's right.
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:34,420
"But we can only guarantee about 20,000,
all right?"

206
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,547
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,675
- "We've got a state to run."
- Yep.

208
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,679
"And if you disagree,
we will kill you on the spot."

209
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,557
How could that be a stronger joke?

210
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:49,519
How could we make that stronger? Huh.

211
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,980
Maybe we don't kill the teachers
at the end?

212
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,064
All right. All right.

213
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,484
- Don't kill the teachers.
- Don't kill the teachers.

214
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,864
Oh, here's the worst thing
about the War on Drugs,

215
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,075
aside from black people getting killed...

216
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,704
It's drug dealers. Right?

217
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:12,208
Yeah, it's drug dealers.
Because when you make drugs illegal...

218
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,669
- You gotta go to a drug dealer.
- you gotta go to drug dealers.

219
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,296
- And drug dealers...
- They can be obnoxious.

220
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,133
- Yeah. They can.
- They can be a bit obnoxious.

221
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,135
They always try to push their agenda
on people.

222
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,302
That's right.

223
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,847
- Like, our drug dealer's a feminist.
- Yeah.

224
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,391
And, you know, I love feminism.

225
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,102
I got a button that says "I'm a feminist,"
so I'm good.

226
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,730
- Yeah.
- I'm a feminist.

227
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:37,650
It's just when I'm trying to buy weed,
I don't want to talk about shit like that.

228
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:38,860
Nah, man.

229
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,363
I just want to smoke
and get my mind off of the real shit.

230
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,906
But he doesn't let that happen.

231
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,784
So, we went to his crib,
went to go pick up our shit,

232
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:50,580
and the WNBA was playing, and...

233
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,084
And we were, like, "Oh, man, that's cool.
Could you get us our weed?"

234
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,462
- "And we'll be right out."
- "We'll just be gone."

235
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,505
He was, like, "No, no, no. Sit down."

236
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,969
And he held our weed hostage
for a whole half.

237
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,305
And we were, like, "We gotta go, man.

238
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,682
Please, just give us the weed.
Let's get the fuck out of here."

239
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,852
He's, like, "Look, man, I don't understand
why y'all are acting like this.

240
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:17,023
I guarantee if they got rid of the NBA,
more people would watch the WNBA."

241
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,525
And we were, like, "Nah."

242
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,113
That's not how things work.
You know what I mean?

243
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,699
You can't get rid of something
that's super-dope

244
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,826
and replace it with something
that's not as dope.

245
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,871
I mean, it's dope, but not as dope.
You know what I mean?

246
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,998
A couple summers ago,
you didn't hear nobody say,

247
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,875
"Now that Michael Jackson's dead,

248
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,669
I can finally listen
to all this Jermaine Jackson."

249
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:42,924
- Ain't nobody say that.
- Nobody said that.

250
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,801
- Ain't nobody say that shit.
- No one said that.

251
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,177
Ain't nobody say that.

252
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,762
I don't know.
That punchline might be a little dated.

253
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,139
- You think we need to update it?
- I think we need to update the punchline.

254
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,517
All right, all right. Start over.

255
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,644
- You want to start with what?
- The middle.

256
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,437
- "Super dope." Do the joke.
- Okay.

257
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,608
Because you can't get rid of something...

258
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,362
that's super-dope

259
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,740
and replace it with something
that's not as dope.

260
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,368
- I mean, it's dope, but not as dope.
- Not as dope. Yeah.

261
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,452
Like...

262
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,498
this year, you ain't hear nobody say,
"Now that Prince is dead,

263
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,668
I can finally listen
to all this Jermaine Jackson."

264
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,883
Same punchline. Same. I got you.

265
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,552
It's the same punchline.

266
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,180
Exact same punchline.

267
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,349
- Oh, fucking...
- No one's listening to Jermaine Jackson.

268
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,892
No one's listening to Jermaine.

269
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,480
We were actually drug dealers
for a little bit.

270
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,565
Yeah.

271
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,985
We were in Boston,
selling prescription drugs.

272
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,611
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

273
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,863
To kids. I'm just kidding.

274
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,449
Selling drugs to kids.

275
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,659
No. We were in Boston,

276
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,203
giving out free 40s and weed
to the homeless people.

277
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,413
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,291
We tried to do some volunteer work.
You know what I'm saying?

279
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,295
We were giving that out,
and one thing about Boston:

280
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,589
They take their sports seriously.
I'll tell you that.

281
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,216
- It's on another level.
- Even the homeless people.

282
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,968
- That's right.
- It's crazy.

283
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,180
We tried to hand him the 40,
and he hit it out of our hands,

284
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:17,393
and he showed us his cardboard cutout,
and it had a note on it.

285
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,519
And was, like, "Yo."

286
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,605
He didn't say, "Yo."

287
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,943
He didn't say, "Yo."
He was, like, "I just lost my house,

288
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,697
my family, my job.

289
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,034
I really have nothing to live for.

290
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,411
And I would kill myself if I had a gun."

291
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,413
- Mm-hmm. "But I can't afford it."
- No.

292
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,543
"Dot, dot, dot, fuck the Yankees."

293
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,050
I was, like,
"Oh, man, that's really cool."

294
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,428
- Yeah, fuck them.
- Pretty cool homeless dude. I like that.

295
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,308
We were watching this thing.
It was about Andrew Luck.

296
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,812
He had just got offered
a $150 million contract.

297
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,523
And there was a reporter there,
and they asked him,

298
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,566
"You think Andrew Luck
is gonna take this contract?"

299
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,235
And the reporter was, like,

300
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,988
"Man, he has 150 million reasons
to take that contract."

301
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,366
- I love... I like that.
- Yeah, yeah.

302
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,576
- I want to do that.
- We should start doing that.

303
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,913
Fuck it. Why not?
If he can do it, why can't we do it?

304
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,581
- So, we started doing it.
- Yeah.

305
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:25,586
Our buddy Mookie asked us
if we wanted to go to the titty bar.

306
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,672
- Titty Tuesdays.
- Titty Tuesdays.

307
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,842
And we were, like, "Look, man,
we would love to indulge you,

308
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:37,974
but we got about negative-three reasons
why... we can't do it."

309
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,601
- Callback!
- I know, I know.

310
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,021
Gotta do it for...
I do it for the callbacks.

311
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,691
- I live for the callbacks.
- I live for the callback, too.

312
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,860
Who in here loves O.J. Simpson,
by a show of hands?

313
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,905
- Raise them up, baby. O.J.
- Be proud of O.J.

314
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,865
- Y'all should be proud of the Juice.
- The Juice, baby.

315
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,033
He likes the Juice.

316
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,119
- Juice!
- Juice, baby.

317
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,329
- All dudes.
- All dudes.

318
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,956
The Juice is loose.

319
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,209
We'd like to dedicate this portion
of our set to O.J.

320
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,753
Admittedly...
These are admittedly bad jokes.

321
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,463
- Yes.
- They're bad jokes.

322
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,674
But we gotta do them
because we love O.J.

323
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,800
Yeah.

324
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,802
So, you want to start?
It's an O.J. trilogy.

325
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,928
- There's only three jokes.
- Yeah.

326
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,226
All right. So, we were going to the bar.

327
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,187
It wasn't a bar, it was a club.
We were going to this club,

328
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,231
and we were excited to go.
We got these new hats.

329
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,569
We were, like, super stoked
to get there.

330
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,739
We got there, and the bouncer was, like,
"I'm sorry, guys.

331
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,282
No hats. You can't get in."

332
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,785
And normally...
We've had that happen before.

333
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,245
Of course.

334
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,165
But the thing was,
the bouncer was wearing a hat.

335
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,375
- He was wearing a fucking top hat.
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,129
- Hypocritical.
- Yeah.

337
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:53,132
Like, you can't tell someone
they can't get in

338
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,468
when you're doing the same shit
that they're doing.

339
00:18:55,551 --> 00:19:00,931
Exactly. I mean, that'd be like if O.J.
banned Chris Brown

340
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,100
from the He-Man Woman-Hater Club.

341
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,149
- First joke. All right.
- First joke.

342
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,154
We went to law school
for two-and-a-half years, right?

343
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,238
Mm-hmm.

344
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,532
And we had to drop out.
We dropped out.

345
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:21,827
We had to because, one:
It was all white people.

346
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:22,912
Yeah.

347
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,915
- Professors and students.
- Professors and students.

348
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,004
And two: Law is the tool of oppression
to, like, destroy black lives.

349
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,215
I don't want to study that
with white people.

350
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,093
- That's bizarre.
- Yeah. Yeah.

351
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,303
That'd be like if...

352
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,143
That'd be like if Ron Goldman
took a knife-sharpening class with O.J.

353
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,525
- The knife is law.
- And the... Yeah.

354
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,569
O.J. is white people.
Ron Goldman is black people.

355
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,071
You get it, you get it.

356
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,240
- Third joke.
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:06,330
We have a friend who loves God.
Like, and it's kind of annoying, too,

358
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:10,167
because he uses God to justify
the most dramatic events.

359
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,377
Right?

360
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,087
Like, he got into a car accident.

361
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,798
And rather than get upset,
which I thought he would do,

362
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,883
he was, like, "No, it's cool.

363
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,803
It's probably just God's way of telling me
to get a new car."

364
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,807
Could've been.

365
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,851
- Pretty weird justification.
- Yeah.

366
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:32,064
That'd be like if O.J. was in court,

367
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,900
and he was, like, "Yes, that's right.
I did kill them.

368
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,318
I killed them both.

369
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,405
But I think that was just God's way
of telling me

370
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,741
- to hang around more black people."
- Yeah.

371
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,162
- Could've been.
- Could've been.

372
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,539
- Could've used that defense.
- God works in mysterious ways.

373
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,623
That's right.

374
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,293
- You don't know.
- You don't know what He does.

375
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:53,377
No.

376
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,421
All right, look. All right.

377
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,468
- O.J. jokes are tough.
- They're not... They're not easy.

378
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:03,137
Some people say it's easier
to get away with murder.

379
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,648
But here's the thing:

380
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,443
As O.J. once said...

381
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,031
you miss 100% of the stabs
that you don't take.

382
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,115
That's right.

383
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,704
- Oh, man. I think we ran out.
- I think we ran out of juice, guys.

384
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:31,457
I think we're done. I think we're done.

385
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,460
I think we're done.
I think we ran out of juice.

386
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,463
- I think we're running out of...
- I think we're running out of juice.

387
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,965
You know who loved O.J. Simpson?

388
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,259
Richard Nixon did. Loved him.

389
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,722
- You know who else loved...
- Proof.

390
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:52,937
You know who else loved O.J.?

391
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:01,195
Crazy.

392
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,863
Crazy.

393
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,786
- We rest our case.
- We rest it.

394
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,333
- We rest our case.
- We rest it.

395
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,127
This is what we spent our money...
Like, this...

396
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,296
Law school was worth it
just for this moment.

397
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,798
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,552
- Netflix already paid us, right?
- That's right.

399
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,679
- Cool.
- We're good?

400
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,431
- We're good?
- We got it. We got the okay. All right.

401
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,560
No, we took out a lot of loans
to go to law school.

402
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,061
Like, a lot.

403
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,855
And now they want their money back,
which is weird.

404
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:39,817
I thought they would be happy
that we're pursuing our dreams.

405
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,901
Mm-hmm.

406
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,404
- But they don't give a fuck about that.
- They don't care about dreams.

407
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:45,948
They call us every week,

408
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,159
demanding their money back.

409
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,538
- And we hang up every week...
- That's right.

410
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,872
and smoke instead.

411
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,374
Yeah, yeah.

412
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,962
But we decided to talk to them one time.

413
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,297
You're wiping my nose off?

414
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:04,008
- Is it sweaty?
- Yeah, it's a little sweaty.

415
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,175
- It's good now.
- Is it cool now?

416
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,385
You got some sweat on yours.

417
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,222
- All right. Sorry.
- What was I talking about?

418
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,516
- Loans.
- Loans, yeah. So, they call us,

419
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,476
and we talked to him,
and he was, like,

420
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,729
"Look, you guys have been avoiding me
for the last decade.

421
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,938
But here's the thing:

422
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,151
We can figure this shit out together.

423
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,278
We'll come together,
put our heads together.

424
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,489
Let's come up with a plan
and we can move on."

425
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,700
- So, we hung up on him immediately...
- Mm-hmm.

426
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,538
rolled up a joint
and thought long and hard about this.

427
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:37,750
- And I think we figured it out.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

428
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,044
- I know how we're gonna pay it back.
- Yeah.

429
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,173
So, we called him and we told him,
"Look, dude, we figured it out.

430
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,759
We're gonna turn all of our library cards

431
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,803
into credit cards."

432
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,518
- It's a great plan.
- It's a fantastic plan.

433
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,899
- We grew up fatherless.
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,028
Not because he died.
He got arrested when we were, like, two.

435
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,823
And he went to prison for 20 years,
and we don't know what he did.

436
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:13,243
No, no. We have no...
Like, he just disappeared.

437
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:14,828
We were, like, "Oh, all right.
I guess he's gone."

438
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:15,913
Yeah.

439
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,041
But as we got older,
we wanted to figure out what he did,

440
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,918
so we did a little bit of research.

441
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:25,339
We went to the Newark Public Library
and found out that,

442
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,925
in order to get 20 years
in the state of New Jersey,

443
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,718
you can do one of four things.

444
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:33,681
Commit first-degree murder,
second-degree murder,

445
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,517
child molestation or tax evasion.

446
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,937
Mm-hmm. So, we immediately got rid
of tax evasion, right?

447
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,315
The nigga was broke. He had no money.

448
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,319
That left us with three choices.

449
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,864
- All bad.
- Terrible. Terrible choices.

450
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,075
But I feel like this might be
the only situation

451
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,993
where you kind of hope
your father's a murderer.

452
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,078
Mm-hmm.

453
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,290
Not child molestation.

454
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,126
No, no. You can't hit the streets
with that.

455
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,838
No. You can't make a rap album
if your dad's a child molester.

456
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,674
No, no, no. No.

457
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,804
Maybe punk rock, but not... not rap.

458
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,391
Our father did not let prison
hold him down.

459
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,519
- No, he did a lot of dope shit.
- He was an overachiever.

460
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,438
Yeah, he overachieved in prison.

461
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,399
He actually got his college degree
in prison.

462
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:29,153
He was actually the first dude
in our family to get his degree in prison.

463
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,487
That's right.

464
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,157
- So, that's dope.
- That's huge.

465
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,703
The only problem is,
he got his degree in philosophy.

466
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,125
Why would you get that degree in prison?

467
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,335
You can't... It's a shitty degree
to get in college.

468
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:48,630
It really is.
Horrible degree to get in college.

469
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,258
It's just not practical.

470
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:54,011
How do you use a fucking philosophy degree
in prison?

471
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,472
Like, what's the practical situation?

472
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,682
- In, like, a shank situation.
- Yeah.

473
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:03,020
Like, how would he maneuver himself
out of that with philosophy?

474
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,689
Like, some dude comes out of nowhere
and tries to shank him.

475
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,691
"I'm about to shank you, homey."

476
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:10,652
What is he gonna be like?
"Man, how do you know that knife is real?"

477
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,785
"I don't know.
You must think, my friend."

478
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:18,869
That's right.

479
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,167
So, now that...
Our father actually is out of prison.

480
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,836
He's not in prison anymore.
And it sucks that he's out.

481
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,713
- I wish he was still there.
- Oh, yeah.

482
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,006
I want him to go back,

483
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,966
because all he wants to do
is father-son shit,

484
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,676
and I'm, like, "Dude, we pay rent now.
I'm over it."

485
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,011
It's over, man.

486
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,515
"You had your opportunity,
and now it's... "

487
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,892
He wanted to play basketball,
and he took us to the court,

488
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,686
and the entire time,
he was fucking arrogant.

489
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,064
Mm-hmm. Prison turned him cocky.

490
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,148
Yeah.

491
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,360
We were playing ball,
and he was, admittedly, destroying us.

492
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,488
- Yeah.
- And, uh, after the game,

493
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:59,660
he was, like, "Yo, man,
if I was about six, seven inches taller,

494
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,495
I could've been in the NBA."

495
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,582
We're, like, "You'd probably just be
a taller criminal, right?"

496
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:08,919
That's it.

497
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:12,673
But it got us thinking. Do you think
NBA players do the same thing,

498
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,174
but in reverse?

499
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,093
Do they talk about the things
they would do

500
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,678
if they were a little bit shorter?

501
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,681
- Maybe.
- Maybe.

502
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:25,060
Like, LeBron James and Kevin Love
chilling at Chuck E. Cheese.

503
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:30,566
And LeBron James is, like,
"Yo, man. Hey, Love."

504
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,775
"What up?"

505
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,988
"Yo, man, if I was ten inches shorter..."

506
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:42,786
"What up, man?"

507
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,162
"I'm trying to think.

508
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,002
Oh, I'd kill myself.

509
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,547
- I'd definitely jump off a bridge."
- "You should."

510
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,507
- "I'll lose all my endorsements."
- "You will."

511
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,928
We can't watch the NBA anymore.

512
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,305
- No, no.
- We're done.

513
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,682
- Advanced stats are ruining the game.
- Killing the game.

514
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,475
I don't know if y'all know
about advanced stats,

515
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:08,186
but it's, like, this shit
where they use, like, calculus.

516
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,606
- Overanalyze.
- Overanalyzing the stats, man.

517
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,150
It's too confusing.
And they're scary now.

518
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:16,361
We saw this one stat,
and y'all may have seen this, too.

519
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:20,782
It said every time Steph Curry shoots
40 percent from the three-point line,

520
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:22,659
a black man gets killed by the police.

521
00:28:22,743 --> 00:28:23,744
That's crazy.

522
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,121
- Y'all see that one?
- Terrifying.

523
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,664
Terrified us.

524
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,125
- We gotta stop Steph Curry.
- Somebody gotta stop that nigga.

525
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,963
- We gotta D him up.
- Gotta put an end to this.

526
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,926
Because of all this black suffering, guys,

527
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,929
we have to do something.
You can't just smoke weed

528
00:28:42,012 --> 00:28:44,681
and listen to Deion Sanders
hip-hop videos.

529
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,059
- No.
- That can't be life. You gotta do shit.

530
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,395
No. So, we want to be more active.

531
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:52,397
So, we decided to join
the Black Panther Party.

532
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,690
That's right.

533
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,818
Yeah, we joined.
We're the newest members.

534
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,280
- It's been great.
- It's been pretty dope, man.

535
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,908
It's not like what they used to be.
They don't march and shit.

536
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,328
- We actually have movie nights.
- Yes. Movie nights.

537
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,789
Movie nights.
And they asked us to bring the movie.

538
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:12,334
Mm-hmm. And we were fucking delighted.

539
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,671
I mean, how often are you gonna have
a chance to bring a movie

540
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,297
to a Black Panther party?

541
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,383
- Not many.
- No.

542
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,593
We thought long and hard about it,
and we brought <i>Scream 2.</i>

543
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,678
Yes.

544
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,223
- It's a classic.
- Complete classic.

545
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,143
And we were excited about it.
We rushed to the party,

546
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:34,731
put the DVD in, hit play,
sat back, chilled.

547
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,026
And in the first seven minutes
of the movie,

548
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,862
they killed Jada Pinkett Smith
and Omar Epps.

549
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:41,947
Mm-hmm.

550
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,199
Before the opening credits, too.

551
00:29:44,283 --> 00:29:46,535
- It was actually kind of masterful.
- Before the title sequence.

552
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,912
Yeah, it was masterful, actually,
how they did it.

553
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,998
But the Black Panthers lost their minds.

554
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,333
They stopped the movie midway through,

555
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,460
and they were, like,
"Look, this is what I'm talking about.

556
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,714
This is the systematic oppression
in Hollywood

557
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,632
that's ruining black actors.

558
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,176
We can't watch this movie.
It's offensive to black people.

559
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,053
Turn this shit off."

560
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,723
- We told them to take a chill pill.
- Mm-hmm.

561
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,393
And just watch the rest of the movie.

562
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:15,522
Because after the killer kills
the only two black people,

563
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,983
he's gonna kill at least 20 white people.

564
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,067
That's right.

565
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,821
That's a ten-to-one ratio,
if you're doing the math.

566
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,614
- Yes.
- It works in our favor.

567
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,116
It works in our favor.

568
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,244
- It works in our favor.
- It works.

569
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:33,206
I think they agree with our sound logic.

570
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:38,045
Because this week we're watching
the last 15 minutes of <i>Titanic.</i>

571
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,254
That's right.

572
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:44,134
That's 3,000 to zero,
if you're doing the math.

573
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,053
- That's a lot of white suffering, guys.
- Mm-hmm.

574
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,389
And black people like white suffering.

575
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,684
- It's true.
- It's true. We did some research

576
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,561
- with Henry Louis Gates...
- These guys don't believe us.

577
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,729
and Marcus Garvey.

578
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,147
- We did some research.
- They don't believe us.

579
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,690
And look at this. Look at this shit.

580
00:31:04,488 --> 00:31:06,156
See that right there?

581
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,033
Black happiness.

582
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,078
Seventy-seven percent of it
is white suffering.

583
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,748
Now, 11 percent of it...
You gotta show them over here.

584
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,251
Eleven percent of it is Beyoncé and Jesus.

585
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,421
They're neck and neck.

586
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:25,342
And the third thing is the NBA,
because obviously niggas love NBA.

587
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,553
And the last thing
is more white suffering.

588
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:32,099
That's 3.5. It accounts for 80 percent.

589
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,353
- It accounts for 80 percent.
- These are the stats.

590
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,814
- I don't question stats.
- I don't question facts.

591
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:39,898
No.

592
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,779
Should we do this joke? Because...

593
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,157
- Hmm.
- Ehh.

594
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,742
Go for it. Go for it.

595
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:52,953
- Fuck it.
- Yeah, fuck it, you know?

596
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:55,497
We went to school in the inner city,

597
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,417
and the best thing about the inner city:
public schools...

598
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,501
Oh, yeah.

599
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,044
Not because of the quality.
They sucked.

600
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:04,047
But you'd do a lot of
interesting things there, right?

601
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,759
We got to color historical black figures
every Black History Month.

602
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,511
- It was fantastic.
- It was dope.

603
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:14,933
Now, normally, kids will color the figures
brown or... brown.

604
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:20,021
And we decided to be a little, you know...
what's it called... non-conformist.

605
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,690
- Avant-garde.
- Avant-garde.

606
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:28,238
So, we colored everybody pink,
black and white,

607
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,074
in honor of our favorite professional
wrestler, Bret "The Hitman" Hart.

608
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,242
That's right.

609
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,540
- Our teacher didn't like that.
- No, no.

610
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,917
She was very upset.
She was, like, "You can't do that.

611
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,294
It's disrespectful to the cause."

612
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,629
And we said, "Take a chill pill.

613
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,051
Because I'm sure if Dr. King
was here today,

614
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,845
he would see the picture and say,
'Look,

615
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:55,140
it is not about the color
of that character's skin.'"

616
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,395
- It's so bad.
- Keep going.

617
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:03,398
"'It is about the content
of the color of his character.'"

618
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,524
That's right.

619
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,737
- "And secondly."
- "And most importantly,

620
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,782
Bret Hart is dope as fuck."
Here's the thing.

621
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,119
He is, he is. Here's the thing:

622
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:19,748
"He beat Bam Bam Bigelow,
Undertaker, Shawn Michaels,

623
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,791
Owen Hart... his brother...
in the same decade."

624
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,876
Yeah.

625
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,419
"Dr. King can't do that.

626
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:27,422
I don't think he could pull it off."

627
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,550
She suspended us for two or three weeks.

628
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,135
Mm-hmm.

629
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:33,678
But the joke's on her,

630
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:38,934
because in that three weeks,
we watched reruns of <i>Matlock...</i>

631
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,018
Mm-hmm.

632
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,938
which inspired us to go to law school.

633
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,565
Yeah. And become the lawyers
that we are today.

634
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,691
That's right.

635
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:57,494
I had a dream two days ago

636
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,207
that I ran for Mayor of Newark.

637
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,378
- No one knew about him.
- No one knew about me.

638
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,255
Just me. I ran for Mayor of Newark

639
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,174
on a platform of free 40s and weed
for all my niggas.

640
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,259
Mm-hmm.

641
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,265
And I won in a landslide. It was crazy.
Crazy landslide.

642
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,269
But the lobbyists weren't happy about it.

643
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:25,438
- They didn't like his socialist agenda.
- That's right.

644
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,608
- So, I got assassinated.
- Mm-hmm.

645
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,362
And then the next day,
I showed up like nothing happened.

646
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,579
- I had to address the situation.
- Yes, of course.

647
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,665
They just saw a nigga get killed.
I gotta explain why.

648
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,961
I was, like, "Look, dudes, I know you guys
just saw me get killed.

649
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:52,549
But money, weed and bitches!
I'm back, baby!

650
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:55,760
I'm back!"

651
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:03,893
Terrified of the police.

652
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,438
- Oh, yeah.
- Terrified of the police.

653
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,273
That's the problem with the War on Drugs.

654
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:12,152
It's an increased militarization
of the police.

655
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,571
They get all into the communities,
like in New York,

656
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,073
- and they just get too aggressive.
- Too aggressive.

657
00:35:17,157 --> 00:35:19,951
We were leaving Tutu's, because
the bathroom line was way too long.

658
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,245
We said, "Fuck it.
We're just gonna go home."

659
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:25,957
And as we were walking home,
a cop just flashed his gun on us.

660
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:28,251
It wasn't a flashlight. It was a gun.

661
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,755
- And I'd never seen a gun before.
- Never.

662
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,340
- Not in person.
- Only on <i>Matlock.</i>

663
00:35:33,423 --> 00:35:34,424
That's right.

664
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,928
That black dude always had a gun.
All right.

665
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:41,348
And I'd never seen a gun.

666
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:46,311
He pointed the gun at me,
and then he pointed it at him,

667
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,315
and then he pointed it at me,
and then he pointed it at him,

668
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,486
and then he pointed it at me,
and then he pointed it at him,

669
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,947
and then he pointed it at me,
and then he stopped.

670
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:00,325
- And we got super nervous.
- Very nervous.

671
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,702
We thought we were goners,

672
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,121
because Steph Curry shot 40 percent
that night,

673
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:09,542
- and we thought we were gonna get shot.
- Yeah.

674
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,046
- Fortunately enough, he didn't kill us.
- No.

675
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:15,924
- He just wanted a selfie.
- That's all he wanted.

676
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,135
He just wanted to take a selfie.
Saw us in <i>22 Jump Street,</i> liked us,

677
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,512
asked for a picture.

678
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,807
- He was actually a pretty cool cop.
- Pretty cool cop.

679
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,726
So, we took the picture with him
because he had a gun.

680
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,690
Snapped it, and then he flew away
on his horse.

681
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:32,774
- Yeah.
- Right?

682
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,945
- As he's flying away, we had an epiphany.
- Mm-hmm.

683
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,073
We realized how to solve the problem
of police brutality.

684
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,035
You just gotta give every black dude
a two-to five-minute cameo

685
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,454
in a movie with Jonah Hill
and Channing Tatum.

686
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:52,043
- Or Seth Rogen.
- Or Seth. He works, too. He works.

687
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,547
- And it'll work.
- Because black lives matter.

688
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,048
They do.

689
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:58,842
- They matter.
- They fucking matter.

690
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,885
They fucking matter.

691
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:07,726
But in America, black cameos matter
a little bit more.

692
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,770
Nah, they do.

693
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,731
- It's unfortunate.
- It's unfortunate.

694
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,445
- So, now we're terrified of guns.
- Mm-hmm.

695
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,074
And whenever we see Republicans
on the news

696
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,452
talking about people
should have more guns,

697
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,912
- we say, "Fuck that."
- No.

698
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:32,625
And as activists,
we had to do something about it.

699
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,211
So, we're, like,
"We're gonna write them a letter

700
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,130
expressing our discontent."

701
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,717
So, we're gonna share that letter
with y'all today.

702
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,346
"Dear Republicans,

703
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,767
what's good?

704
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:57,233
We recently saw you on the TV
making a defense for guns.

705
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:02,447
One of your members argued
that if people have more guns,

706
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,698
they'll be safer.

707
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,743
We disagree with that logic.
Here's why.

708
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,581
Twentieth-century poet
and hood scholar Biggie Smalls once said,

709
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,084
and I quote,

710
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,712
- 'Where Brooklyn at?'
- Mm-hmm.

711
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,757
'Where Brooklyn at?

712
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,761
Where Brooklyn at?

713
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,515
Where Brooklyn at?

714
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,975
Check it.

715
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,605
I got seven MAC-11s,
about eight .38s,

716
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,651
nine 9s, ten MAC-10s.

717
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,319
The guns never end.'

718
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,533
End quote.

719
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:56,000
That's about 34 to an infinite amount
of guns for one gangsta rapper.

720
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,420
- And that nigga still got shot."
- That's right.

721
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:11,683
"P.S.:

722
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,645
Fuck Richard Nixon."

723
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,484
Okay?

724
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,490
We'd like to close on a lighter note.

725
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,996
Any of y'all seen the movie <i>Space Jam?</i>

726
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,625
- It's a classic.
- Classic in its genre.

727
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,168
Some people argue

728
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,880
that it's the <i>Citizen Kane</i>
of Michael Jordan movies.

729
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,675
- We don't disagree.
- We don't disagree with that.

730
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,180
But the one thing that always...
<i>I </i>always question

731
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:55,518
is how did Michael Jordan convince
Charles Barkley to be in the movie?

732
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,688
- It's a quagmire.
- Yes.

733
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,736
But I think we figured it out,
and we're gonna share it with y'all

734
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,446
- in a reenactment.
- Yes.

735
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,824
He's gonna be Michael Jordan,
the great Air Jordan.

736
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,702
- Air Jordan.
- And I'm gonna be Charles Barkley.

737
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,786
And I'm Michael Jordan.

738
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,705
You're Michael Jordan,
I'm Charles Barkley.

739
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,582
- The Round Mound of Rebound.
- Are you getting that?

740
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,668
What are you doing? Are you doing this?
You want to do it with this?

741
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,378
- Yeah.
- Symmetry.

742
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:27,717
- All right.
- All right, now.

743
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,553
Harken back to 1994.

744
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,973
- Come back with us.
- Come back with us.

745
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:36,893
This is right after the O.J. murders.

746
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,650
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.
Ring, ring, ring, ring.

747
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,985
Yo, hello. Who's this? Who's this?

748
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:49,447
- It's me, man. It's Michael Jordan.
- Oh, man, it's Air Jordan?

749
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,991
How you doing, man?
How's baseball going, brother?

750
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:58,373
I don't really want to talk... No.

751
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,832
- You sure?
- No, I'm good.

752
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:01,668
I saw you on ESPN.
It wasn't looking good.

753
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,462
- I didn't look too good.
- No, it wasn't good, man.

754
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,131
This is not a call about baseball.
It's about movies.

755
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,634
All right, man, okay.
Don't be so aggressive.

756
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,928
- Movies.
- You're getting into the movie industry?

757
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,138
- That's right.
- You're getting into the movie industry?

758
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,975
- That's dope.
- I came up with this compelling story.

759
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,686
- Word? You're writing movies?
- I'm writing it now.

760
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,355
- Oh, shit.
- And I think you'll be great for the role.

761
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,856
- You want me to be in it?
- I do.

762
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,316
What's the movie about?

763
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,736
So, it's a basketball story, right?
David and Goliath, all right?

764
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:33,866
On one team, it's gonna be Shawn Bradley,
it's gonna be Muggsy Bogues,

765
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,493
Larry Johnson...

766
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,495
- Grandmama. You like him.
- I like Grandmama.

767
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,830
- Patrick Ewing.
- Patrick?

768
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:43,209
Patrick. I mean, that's a solid
all-NBA fourth team, if they had it.

769
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,003
- That's a good team.
- If they had it.

770
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,673
- It's a solid team, a solid team. Solid.
- Yes.

771
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,758
- I mean, that's a solid team.
- It's a great team.

772
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,593
Who's gonna be on your team, though?

773
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:55,263
Who are you gonna have?
You gonna have Karl Malone, the Mailman?

774
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,598
- You ain't gonna have... Shawn Kemp?
- No.

775
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:00,018
- You ain't have the Reign Man?
- Mm-mm.

776
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,602
- The Glove?
- No.

777
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:03,813
- Detlef Schrempf?
- No.

778
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,233
- Stockton?
- No.

779
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,526
Daffy Duck.

780
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,534
- You still there?
- No, I'm still...

781
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:20,163
Is that, like, a pet nickname
for Scottie Pippen?

782
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,708
- Is that a...
- No, the <i>Looney Tunes.</i>

783
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:27,211
I'm talking about... What's the guy's name?
Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd,

784
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,838
Sylvester the Cat, Tweety Bird.

785
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,174
- You're gonna have Tweety?
- I'm gonna have Tweety. Yes.

786
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,383
Oh, shit.

787
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:35,386
Hey, Mike, I'm getting another call.

788
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,347
- Could you hold on? Would you hold on?
- Sure, I'll hold. Sure.

789
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,393
Hey, man. Who's this?

790
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:45,063
- It's Shaq. What's going on?
- What's up, Shaq?

791
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:49,358
Hey. I was on the other line with Mike.
I think he's on LSD or some shit.

792
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,321
Baseball's holding him down.
What's up? What'd you call me for, Shaq?

793
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,405
What's good?

794
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,741
So, you know, I got this movie idea.

795
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:01,079
I've been thinking about this movie idea.
It's, like, great.

796
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:05,166
You know? I really think it can get
an Oscar or something. I don't know.

797
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,001
If we really put a lot of effort into it,

798
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:10,963
it could really compete
for a Golden Globe or something.

799
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,633
I really want you to be in it, too.

800
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,635
- You want me to be in your movie, Shaq?
- Yes.

801
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,719
Okay.

802
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,431
What...

803
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,020
What's the movie about, Shaq?

804
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,107
Two words, man: Rapping genie.

805
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,566
Click.

806
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:35,655
- Hey, Mike.
- What up?

807
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,782
- Sign me up, baby. I'm in.
- All right, baby.

808
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,870
Thank you. You guys have been fantastic.

809
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:44,914
- We appreciate it.
- Thanks.

810
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:06,060
Yo, man, what's taking this dude so long?

811
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:09,105
Drug dealers are the worst.
They really don't care about your time.

812
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,690
That's why I hate the War on Drugs.

813
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,317
If drugs were legal,
we wouldn't need drug dealers.

814
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:15,111
We could just walk
right into a dispensary.

815
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,613
It'd be like Toys "R" Us
for unemployed stoners.

816
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,533
Yeah, for sure, man.
Fuck Nixon for that.

817
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,828
Word. That O.J.-loving douchebag
started the War on Drugs...

818
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,498
or, as I like to call it, the War
on Niggas Who Just Want to Have Fun.

819
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,085
Oh, snap! It's the ghost of Richard Nixon!

820
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,963
Good evening, brothers!

821
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,298
Yo, don't call us brothers.

822
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,633
My apologies.
Would you prefer "Negroes"?

823
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:40,094
Uh, just call us brothers.

824
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,346
Very well, then, nigger...
Brothers!

825
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,767
I overheard your conversation
regarding the War on Drugs.

826
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,603
I'm extremely disappointed.

827
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,313
I mean, you would be. You started it.

828
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,941
I understand you hate it, I do.
I really, really do.

829
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:57,695
However, while you may hate
waiting for a weed dealer,

830
00:44:57,778 --> 00:45:01,741
the consequences of a world
without the War on Drugs

831
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,451
are far worse for you.

832
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,162
Dude, that's insane.

833
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,747
Maybe, maybe not.

834
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,667
I would like to show you a world
without the War on Drugs.

835
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:14,295
Might I indulge you?

836
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,632
All right, Nixon, we're in.

837
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,555
So, wait. How are we gonna get there?

838
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,516
I'm glad you asked. Like this!

839
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,813
- That's not so bad.
- No doubt.

840
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:35,232
Hey, man, where are we going first?

841
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:37,985
Your living room?

842
00:45:40,363 --> 00:45:46,160
No. To none other than the saddest place
in America: Chicago!

843
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,620
Oh, come on, man.

844
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:51,707
I don't really want to go to Chicago, man.
I mean, too many people get shot there.

845
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:54,669
For real, man. And they get shot
for wearing the wrong colors.

846
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,587
I don't want to get shot for wearing
the wrong colors.

847
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:57,672
What's next, shapes?

848
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,465
- Yeah. Can we stay here?
- Please?

849
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:01,634
I'm sorry, nigger-backs.

850
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,095
That's how it has to work.

851
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,312
This is not what I was expecting.

852
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:16,816
Funny, funny, funny.

853
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,819
Listen, instead of investing trillions
of dollars

854
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:23,239
into the increased militarization
of police and prisons,

855
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,908
the money was invested
into infrastructure,

856
00:46:25,992 --> 00:46:28,244
education and treatment,

857
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:32,248
which in turn led to more jobs
for the working poor.

858
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,958
Yo, it seems dope!

859
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,919
Yeah, man, were you lying about this
being miserable for us?

860
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,295
You can't help yourself.

861
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:42,133
Well, brothers.
I haven't quite finished my tour.

862
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,218
Off to Brooklyn!

863
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,056
Oh, snap! It's Tutu's.

864
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,267
Yeah. Friday night's here are wild.

865
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,686
- Can't wait to hear Biggie.
- Hey, Nixon, can you dance?

866
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:02,028
All right. Never mind.

867
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,285
Hey, what the hell is going on here?

868
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,455
I did some research on this.
Let me explain.

869
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:18,586
Okay. "Without the War on Drugs,
you probably don't get hip-hop.

870
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:23,799
Moreover, without the crack epidemic
which accelerated the War on Drugs,

871
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,844
you certainly don't get gangsta rap.

872
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:31,223
And without gangsta rap,
you don't get Biggie!"

873
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:32,600
No Biggie?

874
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,518
No Biggie.

875
00:47:34,602 --> 00:47:37,938
None of it. No "Mo Money Mo Problems."

876
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:41,567
No <i>Life After Death</i>. No<i> Ready to Die.</i>

877
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:44,945
Is that...

878
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:46,822
Christopher Wallace...

879
00:47:47,490 --> 00:47:49,116
CPA.

880
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,535
- How does it make you feel?
- I feel terrible.

881
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:54,288
- You feel lumpy inside, don't you?
- I do.

882
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,998
I want to go back home.

883
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:58,459
We can't take this anymore.
Can you take us back home, dude?

884
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,836
All right. All right. I'll take you back.

885
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,463
Sad niggers.

886
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,635
Ah, this is more like it.

887
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,554
Hey, so did you start the War on Drugs

888
00:48:10,638 --> 00:48:13,641
to give rise to hip-hop
in hopes of empowering black people?

889
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,143
Yes, I did! Yes, of course, I did!

890
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,728
Tell everyone you know.

891
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,563
- Dope.
- Psych!

892
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:23,400
You gullible-ass niggers.

893
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:26,695
I started it because I hate niggers,
Jews and fairies!

894
00:48:29,198 --> 00:48:31,617
- You almost had us there for a second.
- He almost had us there for a second.

895
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,829
- All right. Bye-bye, Nixon.
- Bye, man. Peace, Nixon.

896
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,872
Thanks for the War on Drugs.

897
00:48:36,956 --> 00:48:38,332
Thanks for the tour.

898
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,543
All right. I love you.

899
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,378
- Love you, too, Nixon.
- Peace.

900
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,921
All right. Peace out, nigger.

901
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,299
Want to smoke weed?

902
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:48,968
Damn right, I want to smoke weed.

903
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,346
- To the War on Drugs.
- To the War on Drugs.
