1
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:27,193
I was, like, "You know what?
If you're gonna fuck with me,

2
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,154
l'm gonna have you killed."

3
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,906
But then that guy was like,
"I don't know if I can handle it."

4
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,577
And I was like, "Of course you can't!
Nobody can handle the heat!"

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,579
You guys know. I bring heat.

6
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,331
Buddy, it's broken glass,
so don't touch it.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,544
Yeah... No, don't walk around
with your shoes off.

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,045
Okay.

9
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,965
All right, buddy, I gotta go.
Tonight's the big show.

10
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,134
Okay. I love you. All right, bye.

11
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,803
All right.

12
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,681
So I had that guy fucking killed.
I had him fucking killed.

13
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,683
And that guy
was a theater owner too, right?

14
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,644
Yeah, that guy was the theater owner.
He was the owner of the theater.

15
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,438
Now he's dead.

16
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,316
What, do you got Zika?

17
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:11,196
Hey. Bob. Theater owner. You guys
can start the show whenever you're ready.

18
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,322
Crowd sounds electric.

19
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,783
Yeah! Why wouldn't they?

20
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,912
Well, I trust you guys
to know where the stage is.

21
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,498
Obviously we know how to get to the stage!

22
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,583
Jesus Christ!

23
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,751
Cheers.

24
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,131
Ah.

25
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,134
Yeah!

26
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,677
Let's rock!

27
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,263
Whoo!

28
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,738
â™ª You know that man â™ª

29
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,990
â™ª He's a hell of a man â™ª

30
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:01,412
â™ª He's a bad motherfucker
With a mike in his hand â™ª

31
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,209
â™ª Pimpin' stages all over the world â™ª

32
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,420
â™ª Stackin' paper
Gettin' all the girls â™ª

33
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,589
â™ª When you see him walking by â™ª

34
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,716
â™ª You better step aside â™ª

35
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,012
â™ª Rory â™ª

36
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,264
Ahh.

37
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,185
â™ª Rory â™ª

38
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,066
Yeah!

39
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,444
Oh, my God. Rory!
Can I get your autograph?

40
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,821
Yeah... No!

41
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,531
Get the fuck away from me!

42
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,574
l'm sorry.

43
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,410
Oh, God, you are so fucking cool.

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,870
Yeah!

45
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,163
No fucking shit.

46
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,206
Mike! Let's go.

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,749
See that?

48
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,959
Remember it.

49
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,675
â™ª Rory â™ª

50
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,021
â™ª Rory â™ª

51
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,898
Rory. Rory.

52
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,441
Hey, good luck tonight, Mr. Scovel.

53
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:16,279
Rory. Rory. Rory. Rory.

54
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,615
What'd you just say to me?

55
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,116
Just saying good luck.

56
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,910
Yeah.

57
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,287
I don't need your luck, pal.

58
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,873
- I love you.
- Me too.

59
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,459
Now I gotta go rip some dicks off.

60
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,794
Rory! Rory!

61
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:37,091
Yeah!

62
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,260
Whoo!

63
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,346
Yeah!

64
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,894
Whoo! Whoo!

65
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:54,192
Yeah!

66
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,027
Whoo-hoo!

67
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,826
What's... What's happening?

68
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,787
Gilbert's gonna bring you on stage soon.

69
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,414
What... Hey, Scott, hold on.

70
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,709
- What do I do when I get out there?
- I don't know. We'II figure it out.

71
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,720
Okay, this next guy is a comic.

72
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,932
Uh, everybody give it up for...

73
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,060
Cory Scravin!

74
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,539
Thank you.

75
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you!

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,961
Thank you, Atlanta!

77
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,297
Thank you, Atlanta!

78
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,882
Thank you!

79
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:04,220
Thank you, Atlanta.

80
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,930
Thank you, 'Lanta.

81
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,475
Thank you, 'Lanta.
I did the research. I know the nicknames.

82
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,603
Thank you so much, 'Lantans,
coming out tonight.

83
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,898
Coming down to 'Lanta. Coming out
to see the show. Thank you so much.

84
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,276
Let's get right into it.
Anal. Who's done it?

85
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:25,533
Who's done anal? Who here has done anal?

86
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,118
This is the show. Who has...

87
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:29,245
Earlier it was like,
"Wait. So is this the show?"

88
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,457
This is the show. This is the show.

89
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,167
Anal. Who's done anal?

90
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,878
But, like, anal. Anal, though.

91
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,879
Anal.

92
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,214
Who has done anal?

93
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,967
I have one joke,
and l'm halfway through it.

94
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,555
This is... This is it.

95
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,224
I do sort of a reverse Louis CK.

96
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,351
I write one new joke a year.

97
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,814
And this is actually
a three-year-old joke.

98
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,525
So, should be a pretty good special.

99
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,278
You guys made a good choice, watching.
Thanks for being here.

100
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:06,449
Ah, anal. We're still...
This is still... Anal.

101
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,618
Anal. Anal.

102
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,995
Does that sell it if that's my posture?

103
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,622
Anal!

104
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:14,707
Who's done anal?

105
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,128
l'm the brattiest comic on the circuit!

106
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,881
Who's done anal though?

107
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,180
"Butt-fuck." Does that help?

108
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,473
Does that help?

109
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,725
Does that help though? Butt-fuck.

110
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,186
Some people...
"Oh, butt-fuck. Okay, yeah.

111
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,772
Okay.

112
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:42,527
Yeah, dude said "˜anal,' I was like,
"˜Who's the doctor-lawyer on stage?'

113
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,279
Anal? What?

114
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,825
Butt-fuck. That's more my speed."

115
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,827
That's more my style!

116
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,329
Truth be told, that's more my style.

117
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,498
I butt-fuck!

118
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,916
Wanna know somethin' about me? I butt..."

119
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,210
You have to say "butt-fuck"
with an accent.

120
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:05,049
If you say it without an accent,
you sound like a goddamn serial killer.

121
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,343
"You guys ever butt-fuck?"

122
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,763
"Oh, my God.

123
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,516
Karen, put your fucking hand down!

124
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,643
It's obviously a trap.

125
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,311
It's a death trap."

126
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,230
"Well, I don't know.

127
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:21,774
l've never been to one of these things."

128
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,696
"Yeah, whatever. Butt-fuck!"

129
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,907
Isn't that... It's kinda... Immediately
you're, like, "Oh, that's not so bad."

130
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:34,662
"Y'all ever butt-fuck?"
"Hey, it's the guy from the gas station!

131
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,957
Answer his inquiries."

132
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,502
"I just wanna know
if y'all ever butt-fucked before!

133
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,255
Y'all come on now!

134
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,133
Unleaded, fill it up? You got it!

135
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,594
You ever butt-fucked?"

136
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,514
"Hi. l'd like to fill it up.
l'm over on pump ten.

137
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,851
I gotta tell you, that one employee,
he is a lively sort.

138
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,104
What's that? That's not an employee?
l'II be right back.

139
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,108
No, it's on me. There were a lot
of red flags, and I... I should've...

140
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,360
I should've tuned in. Should've tuned in."

141
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,156
"Y'all ever butt-fucked?

142
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,324
Butt-fuck!"

143
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,872
My wife and I tried anal sex once, and...

144
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,957
Shut the fuck up!

145
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,125
Shut up!

146
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,924
I already asked you if you did it.
Nobody said shit.

147
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,927
And now I have to talk the entire show.

148
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,805
This job sucks.

149
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,562
Right now some people are like,
"Maybe he does only have the one joke.

150
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,650
Where we thought he was being facetious."

151
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,402
The twist in tonight's show was honesty.

152
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,030
Hmm.

153
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,951
My wife and I tried anal sex once,
and I didn't like it,

154
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,620
and for some reason
I feel like that makes me a gentleman.

155
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,291
Huh? That's pretty cool, babe.
We don't have to go down that road again.

156
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,878
Lord knows you hated it. All the tears.

157
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,925
If your wife cries during sex,

158
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,135
she is telling you something.

159
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,596
Check in. You know what I mean?
Do a check-in.

160
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,306
"You okay?" Just one of those.

161
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,058
"Hey, everything cool? What's going on?

162
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,644
Got a little misty here. I don't..."

163
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,313
Also, talk like that.
That's a big turn-on for women.

164
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,107
That's a huge turn-on for women.

165
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,608
"Hey, just a quick question!

166
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,946
What's going on with the tears?"

167
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,826
Be that... Be that ecstatic.

168
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,202
"Hey!

169
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,664
What's the deal with the tears?

170
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,875
Let's get back into it!"

171
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,881
Where did I lose some people?

172
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,971
The visualization of my wife crying
during anal sex?

173
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,141
Is that where some people were like,
"You know what? No.

174
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,852
No, next exit. We'II take the next exit.

175
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,354
l'm not here for this."

176
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,861
If you've ever tried it, that's one thing.
Fine. You tried it.

177
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,531
You ever try to try it?
You know what I mean?

178
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,533
You know what l'm talking about?

179
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,536
That means you're about to try it,
and then you stop and you're like,

180
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,330
"I can't pull this off.

181
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,999
Who do I think I am?

182
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,545
Just 'cause I see it
in all the laptop movies.

183
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,174
That doesn't mean I know what l'm doing."

184
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,594
It's tough to do. It's like trying
to get a lime into a Corona.

185
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,642
Your first thought is always,
"Who cut these?

186
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,064
Didn't they know
what I was gonna do with this?"

187
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,901
It'II go. It'II go.

188
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,778
Know what I mean? It'II go.

189
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,864
Like, it will go. You gotta want it.

190
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,991
You have to want some things.

191
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,535
It'II go if you want it bad enough.

192
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,540
Yeah, my jacket's a problem
for a lot of people.

193
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:13,214
l'm not stupid. I caused this problem.
I fucking know what's going on.

194
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,965
I don't have to look at it.

195
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:19,387
That's how much of a dick I am.
I know that you have to look at it.

196
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,766
Oh, so many people are already like,
"Ahh! Unzip it!

197
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,478
Unzip it! Or buy your size!

198
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,939
You know what I mean? You're fucking...

199
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,776
How badly do you need to fit in?
You're 36. The dream is over."

200
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,823
This? Oh, fuckin'... That shirt?

201
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,992
That shirt flap?
That's the worst part of it all.

202
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,703
All the way around. Just that extra...

203
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,790
Hi! l'm shirt flap!

204
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,084
Oh, that's the cringeworthy part there.

205
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,920
Oh, God.

206
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,505
Some people are like, "Tuck it in."

207
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,424
I can't.

208
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,844
I tuck it in, I look like an undercover
cop who coaches Little League.

209
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,597
"Get two, Kev! Kev, get two!

210
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,809
Kev, you gotta get down.
You gotta slide, Kevin!

211
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,687
Your dad was shit too!

212
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,106
We played together. You'II never go pro."

213
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,525
He's that hard on the players.

214
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,193
"You'II never fucking go pro, dude.

215
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,904
You don't know how to fucking slide?

216
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,991
l'II go back to my dugout in a second.
I wanna talk to your team.

217
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,744
You're shit.

218
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,037
You are shit.

219
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,291
We have seven of you on my team.

220
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,961
Yeah, you hear me?
We got seven of you.

221
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,130
Some of you guys might go pro.

222
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,673
Not you, Kev.

223
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,804
What'd you say?
What did you fuckin' say to me, Kevin?

224
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,598
l'm a goddamn cop.

225
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,312
This is my cover.

226
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,648
My cover is
aggressively coaching Little League."

227
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:01,572
I did a show once... I did a show once
where I had a hoodie on,

228
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,992
and I pulled the string on one side
all the way down to my knee,

229
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,661
and I left a little bit on this side.

230
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:11,165
People didn't even see the show.

231
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,376
The rage in their eyes...

232
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,921
It's like, "No!

233
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,673
We paid to be here!

234
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,550
Fix it!"

235
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,012
I was just twirling it around.
"So, l'm married."

236
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,765
Like, whipping it.

237
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,267
"Marriage is fun."

238
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,190
Oh, what does that do?
What's that do for some people?

239
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,612
Does that help anyone? Does that help?

240
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,781
Is there anybody who is like,
"I didn't like it,

241
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,409
but if you go a little deeper
l'm okay with it"?

242
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,204
Just leave it like that for a little bit.

243
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,374
I can't even use the pocket.

244
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,001
Hi! Yeah. Table for one.

245
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,295
Yeah, table... M-Me again.

246
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,422
Me again. Table for one.

247
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,883
My "yoush."

248
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,762
Put me on my "yoush,"
my one high-top place.

249
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,015
It's not even comfortable
to use the pocket.

250
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,475
Hi!

251
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,689
In three years
Kanye's gonna invent this jacket,

252
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,983
and then everyone's gonna be like,
"Oh, now I like it."

253
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,319
You laugh at me now,
but then you respect it three...

254
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,238
"Now I think it's cool."

255
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:27,032
Bullshit. I set the trend.
Look at this shit.

256
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,286
"Oh, remember? Remember Kanye,
he's got that new jacket.

257
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,914
Remember we saw that comic.
He wore his jacket like that first."

258
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,457
"No, I don't... I don't remember."

259
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,168
"You don't remember?
He killed himself two days later."

260
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,629
You don't remember that?

261
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,174
He said if we didn't laugh at every joke,
he was gonna kill himself.

262
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,760
And that was the one joke
he wasn't joking about.

263
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,681
Remember he had the suicide note
in calligraphy,

264
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,517
so you know he wanted to do it.

265
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,604
Probably took him two weeks to write it.
He thought it out."

266
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,233
My suicide note is just gonna be
the "Thong Song" lyrics.

267
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,696
People will discover my body.
They're like, "Oh, my God!"

268
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,073
"Thong, th-thong-thong-thong."

269
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,327
"Hmm. Why so much SisqÃ³ on the way out?"

270
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,833
If you're thinking of killing yourself,

271
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,128
why not try autoerotic asphyxiation

272
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,131
and see what all the jazz is about!

273
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,008
We're all curious.

274
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,052
We're not gonna do it.

275
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,970
"What if I accidentally kill myself?"

276
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,432
But if you already want to die,
give it a go.

277
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,851
See what it's like.

278
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,186
What if it's amazing?

279
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,730
What if it's so amazing, you're like,
"I think I wanna live"?

280
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,651
"Suicide saved my life."

281
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,820
Coming this fall to CBS.

282
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,573
Suicide Saved My...

283
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,922
I love... I love it when... I love it
when people bow too appropriately.

284
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,173
It's so gross.

285
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:19,353
Just bow. Just be like, "Okay, thanks."

286
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,649
No, but you guys were right
to applaud there.

287
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,988
Everybody watching at home, I assume
you also gave me a standing ovation.

288
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,367
No, the crowd didn't give me a standing
ovation, but at home it's easier to do.

289
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,163
Do a standing ovation, they'd be like,
"While l'm up, might as well take a piss."

290
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,500
"Honey, should I pause it?"
"No, I think I get it.

291
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,004
I think I get most of what he does."

292
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,884
Remember, like, ten years ago
someone would be, like,

293
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,930
"I saw a documentary,"
and we'd all be like, "Nerd!"

294
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,433
Now if someone's like,
"I saw a documentary,"

295
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,978
it's like, "Of course you did.
How else can you keep up socially?

296
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,814
You've gotta see all the documentaries
to know what's going on,

297
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,484
and what did go on,
and what will more than likely go on."

298
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,991
Did you guys see that O.J. documentary?

299
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,619
How did more people not see that?

300
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,455
It's incredible.

301
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,082
His one friend he grew up with,
with the raspy voice?

302
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,836
Know who l'm talking about? That dude...

303
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,629
"O.J...

304
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,258
Growin' up...

305
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,553
O.J. was always murderin' people.

306
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,099
I was like,
"˜O.J., you can't be murderin' pe...'"

307
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,935
His voi... What did he do for the...
Why? Why was...

308
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,562
"O.J."

309
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,940
His whole life his friends are like,
"I don't... You gotta speak up."

310
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,817
"O.J.!

311
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,323
I don't think O.J. killed Nicole.

312
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,867
I think he killed Ron Goldman.

313
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,162
And then Nicole
accidentally killed herself."

314
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,915
Like, he has the shittiest theories.

315
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,709
"I mean, I think Nicole and Ron...

316
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,128
killed O.J.,

317
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,548
and then the two of them,

318
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,802
together..."

319
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,888
"embodied what we now know as O.J."

320
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,976
The documentarian's like,
"I can't use any of this footage.

321
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,146
I can't use any of this.
Where did you even get that?"

322
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,357
"I don't... I don't know.

323
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,527
I haven't seen him in, like, 35 years.

324
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,488
He might have done it... Actually,
he might... He did it. He did it."

325
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,244
I don't think we even need
some of these documentaries.

326
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,913
Like, The Planet Earth and Life.

327
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,999
Like, who is that optimistic
about our intellect...

328
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,252
as people?

329
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,628
Like, we're not there yet.

330
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:52,464
I don't need to learn about a species
at the bottom of the ocean

331
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,383
l'm never gonna interact with.

332
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,385
Let's pull it back.

333
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,596
Let's do some documentaries about
some simple shit. You know what I mean?

334
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,307
How does this microphone even work?
None of us know.

335
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,560
None of us know.
None of us have ever known.

336
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:09,064
Our entire life since we were kids...
"That's the voice stick boom machine."

337
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,110
If someone asked me,
"How do you think it works?" l'd be,

338
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,530
"Well, I guess the sound
kinda drifts over the metal cage.

339
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:18,991
Then the metal cage is like,
"˜Get in here!'

340
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:23,704
Then it just goes through the sound hose."

341
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,623
Blaaaaah!

342
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,127
That's my best guess.

343
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,755
l'm 36.

344
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,969
My best guess is something a child would
just rattle off the top of their head,

345
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,680
in their first time ever
thinking about it.

346
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,807
"I don't know. I guess it just...
Blu-Blah-Blu-Aaaah!"

347
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:47,936
Like, okay. Well, either you're advanced,
or you're heading down the wrong road.

348
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,317
Oh, concrete?

349
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,113
Sorry to turn this into a TED talk.

350
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,451
What the fuck is concrete?
You know what I mean?

351
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,996
Like, liquid soupy shit,
then it's hard forever?

352
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,665
It's just hard forever.

353
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,584
Okay, Illuminati.

354
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,003
Okay. Okay.

355
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,717
"Good luck transporting me
in a normal truck. It won't work.

356
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,554
You have to put me in a cartwheel
funnel truck that's always in motion.

357
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,682
l'm high maintenance. l'm concrete."

358
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,727
You could ask people who work in concrete,
"How does it work?"

359
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,562
"You know what? I don't even...

360
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,398
Just, like, it's liquid soupy stuff,

361
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,943
and then it's just all of the buildings,
you know.

362
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,904
It's literally all of the buildings."

363
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:45,118
You ever ask a friend
how a record player works?

364
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,287
Like, "Well, the needle grabs the sou..."

365
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:49,289
"The wh-what?

366
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,208
Fuckin' listen to yourself!

367
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,044
"˜The needle grabs the sound'?

368
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:56,546
What does that even mean?"

369
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,341
"Well, there's grooves in the vinyl,
and the nee..."

370
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,344
"What is happening in the grooves

371
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,639
that the needle is aware of and grabbing?

372
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,475
What physical thing
is happening in that..."

373
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,186
The show is now over. The show is over.

374
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,856
Turn off the fake cameras.
We won't need 'em.

375
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,235
We're just gonna rant
and get to the bottom of stuff now.

376
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,867
Ultimate Frisbee. That's still going on.

377
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,121
You guys ever watch Ultimate Frisbee?

378
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,206
What does that say about you?

379
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,667
What are you even watching?

380
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,503
Watching someone on defense, like,
"Don't you throw that Frisbee!"

381
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,800
Somebody on offense, like,
"I have to, Jason! Get out of the way!

382
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,052
Jason, get out of the way!

383
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,805
The game is to throw the Frisbee."

384
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,145
Every time someone asks me
to throw the Frisbee, I say yes.

385
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,398
And then my brain's like, "Dude,
you don't fuckin' know what you're doing."

386
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,736
I think you're either great at Frisbee
or you're all like me,

387
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,696
where for every throw you're like,

388
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,823
"Oh, please, God, just go.

389
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,368
Get somewhat near the person.

390
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,704
Sorry!"

391
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,415
You yell "l'm sorry" super fast. "Sorry!"

392
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,753
Right before you release it.
"So sorry! There!"

393
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:23,633
You ever go to throw the Frisbee
and it's immediately sideways?

394
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,512
Can't have those moments back.

395
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,851
Just go to throw it and you're like, "No!

396
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,770
Fuck!

397
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,646
That's not me!

398
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,982
That's not me."

399
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:45,655
You ever see somebody
throw the Frisbee like this?

400
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:49,159
Nobody's getting laid off of Frisbee, pal.

401
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,036
Put it away.

402
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:59,461
Nothing wrong with your classic
1950s-style discus toss.

403
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:06,301
Plenty of children were conceived the
night of a toss like that being witnessed.

404
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,054
"Oh, look at this guy throw it."
"Neil, go deep!"

405
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,142
"Ooh, great angel follow-through."

406
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,771
"Hey, what are you ladies
getting into tonight? There it is!"

407
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,445
"Did you see that guy throw that Frisbee?

408
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:31,493
Ooh. I hope I get the opportunity later
to suck his dick a little bit.

409
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:38,333
Anyone who's innovating
the Frisbee pass at that level,

410
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:42,587
that's the kind of dick
I like to suck a little bit of.

411
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,883
If I get the opportunity.

412
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,594
There's gonna be a line, l'm sure."

413
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,476
Nice.

414
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,147
I know a guy you should meet over here.

415
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,482
You got that laugh,
this guy's got this I...

416
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,819
Would you watch it
if this was my set? "Anyways...

417
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,532
What else is goin' on?

418
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:13,493
Uh, anyways, you ever had a meatball sub?"

419
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,499
All right, all right, all right.

420
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,084
Let's get this...

421
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,587
Let's turn the cameras on. Let's do it.

422
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,967
I usually like to run about
20, 30 minutes to an hour,

423
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,886
and then I like to actually tape it.

424
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:38,685
l'm gonna do a couple election-type jokes
for you all, if that's...

425
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,022
I know...

426
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,149
I know people...

427
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,736
I know people, wherever you're
watching this, whenever it is you're like,

428
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,031
"Wait, the election's already happened.
We already know the results."

429
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:53,867
Guess what.
Everybody in this room, we don't know.

430
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,578
So look at us.
Look how happy we used to be.

431
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,332
We used to be so happy.

432
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,959
Then it all fell apart.

433
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,503
I, personally, am very excited,

434
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,340
because this election
is about inspiration.

435
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,509
When Barack Obama was elected,
he was the first black president.

436
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,761
That's inspiring.

437
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,097
If Hillary Clinton wins this election,
she's the first female president.

438
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,307
That's inspiring.

439
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,811
If Donald Trump wins this election, that's
inspiring for your average Joes like me.

440
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,273
l'm not walking around, assuming
I have a shot at the presidency.

441
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,443
But now it's like, I don't know.
He did it, you know?

442
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,405
What is it? I fill out a form?

443
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,369
Do I send in a tape?
How do I start the process?

444
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,705
You also gotta be optimistic.

445
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:45,210
I mean, if he does win, we're all
gonna get to die at the same time.

446
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,673
That's a special you can't buy.

447
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:52,676
You're either born in that time
or you're not.

448
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,387
It was the dinosaurs, and now it's us.

449
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,764
That's awesome.

450
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,349
That's so cool.

451
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,103
What a way to go. You know what I mean?

452
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:07,274
Like, right now if you die you're like,
"But all my friends are still alive!

453
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,278
Aw, everybody's going out to eat!"

454
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,074
Let's... Let's just...
Let's admit something right now.

455
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,661
You know that's the most adrenaline
we get at this age.

456
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,372
"Hey, we're going out to eat tonight."
"What? I can go too?"

457
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:28,211
"Bottle of wine for the table?
We're skydiving without parachutes now."

458
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,340
I wanna be socially present
for these conversations,

459
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,342
but l'm doing math the whole time.

460
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,678
How are we splitting this bill?

461
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,764
Is Kathy pitching in? Does she pitch in?

462
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,479
Who here is in their 20s?
Anybody here in their 20s?

463
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,732
Yes!

464
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,776
Get some whoo's and some claps.

465
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,530
Soak it up. Enjoy it.
I mean that. l'm not trying to be a dick.

466
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,909
l'm saying you have something right now
and you need to embrace it.

467
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,371
I know you're like,
"I go out. I fuckin' stay out so late.

468
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,667
I stay out till like 3:00 or 4:00.
I fuckin'... I shut it down.

469
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,794
I shut it down.

470
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,130
I do so many shots.

471
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,841
Oh, you should see me.

472
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,178
I do so many fuckin' shots.

473
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,931
You wanna know what separates me
from the herd the most?

474
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,892
All the shots that I do.

475
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,228
So many, I can't even stop.

476
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,814
I force 'em on other people.

477
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,317
You do one with me. You have to!

478
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,069
We have to do it together.

479
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:37,697
And I hope it tastes gross
so we can see who can handle it the best."

480
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:44,412
A shot is the only thing that, when it
tastes like garbage, everyone's like,

481
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,331
"Now, that's a real drink."

482
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,376
If food was like that,
you wouldn't eat the food.

483
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,254
"You know what? If it tastes like garbage,
that's how you know it's good."

484
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,468
"I just did a shot, and it tasted
exactly like an apple pie."

485
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,553
"That's 'cause you're a fuckin' pussy."

486
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,182
Who wouldn't want to drink an apple pie?

487
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,774
Yeah, when you're 30 and up,
oh, it's over.

488
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,984
It's not even your choice.

489
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:17,737
You think you can just keep doing it,
but you can't.

490
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,532
Your body starts to get involved.

491
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:24,244
Your body's like, "What's that?
Wanna do a slice of pizza at 2:00 a.m.?

492
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,413
All right.

493
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,416
Okay.

494
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,127
Good luck. Good luck.

495
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,711
Good luck, dude.

496
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:35,672
Good luck.

497
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:40,135
Hope you're ready to get up at 3:45 with
fuckin' scorched earth right through here.

498
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:46,015
Yeah, go get your Tums.
Go get your Tummies.

499
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,684
Go get your Tums.

500
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,811
"˜I need my Tums!'"

501
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,565
When you're in your 20s
and you have a hangover, you're like,

502
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,650
"God, I need some Advil and water."

503
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,611
In your 30s, that's like
throwing darts at a tank.

504
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,572
And you only had three drinks.

505
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:04,743
One of 'em wasn't even alcohol. But it
was soda, and l'd been off it for so long.

506
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,834
Well, if someone told you

507
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,296
that you could go out
and stay out as late as you want

508
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:19,007
and drink for free every single night

509
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,635
or pay $20 to go to bed at 8:00 p.m.,

510
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:29,893
you would put down $40
just to make sure it definitely happened.

511
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,813
You'd be like, "There's double. Let's not
fuckin' fuck me over on this, dude.

512
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,815
l'm not talking, like, get ready at 8:00.

513
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,235
I mean, at a quarter till
we're picking out our jammies.

514
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,947
When 8:00 rolls around I wanna
almost be there. You know what I mean?

515
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,866
l'm almost asleep! Leave me alone!"

516
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,954
I get old people now. Like, I get it.

517
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,831
Growing up, I didn't understand
my grandparents.

518
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,666
I didn't get it. Now I get it.

519
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,169
"We have dinner at 4:30."

520
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,046
"Why wouldn't you?"

521
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,263
Dinner at 4:30. Bed at 6:00.
Up at 2:00. See the world!

522
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:10,308
See the entire world.
That's the only way you're gonna do it.

523
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,185
The only way you're gonna do it
is to be up at 2:00.

524
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,938
'Cause when you're waking up at 2:00...
Yeah!

525
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,567
My grandfather would be on the porch
to catch the morning paper

526
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,654
and then yell out,
"Why have I been waiting a half hour?"

527
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,492
That's an explorer.

528
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,832
Look, all l'm trying to say is,

529
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,835
if we all die at the same time,

530
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,170
that's like nobody died.

531
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,508
If Trump wins this election, you guys,
we're all gonna live forever.

532
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:49,264
And the sad thing is, that might be
a real slogan you hear before November.

533
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,434
"Vote for me, everybody lives forever."
Like, "What? Okay.

534
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,894
And recess will be longer?

535
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,523
This guy knows something
the rest of us don't know.

536
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,234
I like it."

537
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,115
If I could have it my way, l'd say let's
get another Kenyan for four more years.

538
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,950
You know what I mean?

539
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,080
Yeah. Huh.

540
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:18,585
Some people are like, "That's where the
jokes stopped and the manifesto started."

541
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:21,504
Also, people applauding to that joke,
it's kind of a mixed signal.

542
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:24,757
It's like, do you think
he's not an American citizen?

543
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,593
Are you agreeing with my sarcasm,

544
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,679
or do you not interpret my sarcasm?

545
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,098
"Yes! Get another Kenyan!"

546
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,144
I know Barack Obama is a US citizen.

547
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,105
A lot of people don't think he is.
One of those people might be president.

548
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,900
So if you're not scared now,
think about it.

549
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,362
I kinda like imagining
that he's not a US citizen.

550
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,865
To be the first black president
in this country,

551
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,867
with the shit that this country's
been through,

552
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,578
and the current racial tension
in this country,

553
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,830
to be the first black president,
that's amazing.

554
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,208
But on top of it,
to not even be a US citizen?

555
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,127
What?

556
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,588
l'm sorry. What?

557
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,256
That's astounding!

558
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,135
It's your job
until you don't want it anymore.

559
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:13,139
If he really was not a US citizen, it's
like, "Well, you got us, so it's yours.

560
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,892
Obviously we're not qualified to do it.

561
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,393
It's yours, dude."

562
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,274
If he truly is not a US citizen,
can you imagine

563
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,735
night number one with Michelle
in the White House?

564
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,112
He's like, "Can you fucking
believe this shit?"

565
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,284
I was joking! I was joking.

566
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,119
I never thought it would go this far.

567
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,246
I genuinely never thought
it would go this far.

568
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,835
Michelle's like, "What are we gonna do?
What the fuck are we gonna do?

569
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,840
Just go make an announcement...
Just kidding... and we'II get out of here."

570
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:51,260
"Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Calm down."

571
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,138
If you knew that was a scene that actually
happened in the White House you'd be,

572
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,057
"Let's give 'em 12 years.

573
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,893
They're that adorable?
Twelve years it is."

574
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,235
I would love it if, on his last day,
he just comes out and he's like,

575
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,654
"I gotta come clean
about something with you guys.

576
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,907
I am not even a US citizen."

577
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,911
Wouldn't all of us, even if you hated him,

578
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:20,707
would be like, "Get the fuck out, Barack!

579
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,916
What?

580
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,876
You son of a bitch!

581
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,671
You're good! You're good, dude.

582
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,798
You're good. You're the tops.

583
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,136
How did you do that? We looked into it.

584
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:38,224
You are literally the only president
we ever looked into it about."

585
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:45,523
Nothing racist about that.
Let's keep moving on, you know?

586
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,192
Scoop it under the rug.

587
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,403
No aftereffects. You guys know.

588
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,451
If you think it's so easy,
you guys do that.

589
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,870
That's my declaration to everybody.

590
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,872
If you think it's so easy
to fuckin' pull that off,

591
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:05,501
you go to another country
and you get as far as president.

592
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:11,340
You won't even get as far as solicitor
because none of us know what that is.

593
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,800
We've never known.

594
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,720
Every time you get into a voters' booth,
you're like, "Solicitor?

595
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,014
All right. Who's got the cooler name?

596
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,225
I don't know."

597
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,479
You don't know what solicitors do.
You don't know what mayors do either.

598
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,191
You thought you did growing up.
You're like, "A mayor runs the town.

599
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,568
I saw it in a Richard Scarry book."

600
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,991
Then Marion Barry gets caught
smoking crack in the '90s.

601
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,119
People are like,
"What? But he's the mayor!"

602
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,872
Then Rob Ford in Toronto,
he gets caught smoking crack.

603
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,833
Maybe we, as people, need to step back

604
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,295
and ask ourselves,
"Do mayors smoke crack?"

605
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,341
They might all be smoking crack.
We don't know.

606
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,134
We don't know what they do.

607
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,513
We don't fuckin' know.
That's what they do.

608
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,681
These two just happened to get caught.

609
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:04,018
You know how not everybody
in this room has a DUI,

610
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,437
but we've all been eligible for one?

611
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:11,484
It's like that, except it's crack.

612
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,070
And it's an elected government official.

613
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:16,447
Otherwise, it's the same thing.

614
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,533
That's what they do.

615
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,744
They walk around smoking crack,

616
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,830
carrying their big scissors.

617
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,043
You can't find those scissors anywhere.

618
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,337
That's the biggest crime of it all.

619
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,172
Where do you get those things?

620
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,551
Some of you are like, "Look on Etsy."
I did.

621
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,012
It's the only research I did
in this entire show.

622
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:43,766
I could have googled "solicitor."

623
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,601
I don't give a fuck.

624
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,312
Get me to the scissors gold.

625
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,233
Here, cut the ribbon
with these normal scissors.

626
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,152
No!

627
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,362
It'II never work.

628
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,198
They'II never be able to get through
this kind of silk.

629
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:05,705
I need my giant scissors if we're ever
gonna open the skate park conservancy.

630
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:13,379
I also don't know
what a skate park conservancy is,

631
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,632
but it's fun to say, and people laugh,
and that's really what it's all about.

632
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,473
Gay Republicans.
What do they know that we don't know?

633
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,226
I mean...

634
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,065
is there something online I can read
to get caught up?

635
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,944
It's like l'm trying to support you,
but are you even trying to support you?

636
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:42,450
"Yes, I realize I affiliate myself
with a political party

637
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,829
who doesn't believe that I deserve
to breathe the same air as other people.

638
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,373
And a lot of 'em,
if they knew they could get away with it,

639
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,751
would probably try and kill me.

640
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,461
But you want to know something?

641
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,756
At my core, l'm fiscally conservative."

642
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:04,513
You ever been in your backyard at night,
and you just look up at that endless sky

643
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,307
and you just wonder what it's all about?

644
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,477
Here we are, on a rock,
floating through space.

645
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,270
Whatever this even is.

646
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,482
We don't even know how we got here.
We don't know where we're going.

647
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,111
We don't even currently know
what this is that we exist in.

648
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,573
You see those stars up there,
and they're not even there.

649
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,243
It's just we're finally seeing
the light from those stars.

650
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:28,037
And just something like that
is so mind-blowing,

651
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,206
you just want to yell out
to the heavens...

652
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,626
"Are we spending too much?"

653
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,508
You guys know.
The bigger questions in life.

654
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,349
We'II be right back after these messages.

655
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,731
Jack White, you're a revolutionary artist.

656
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,485
You're known for doing a lot of firsts
in lots of different fields.

657
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,862
Rory, you've never done stand-up before.

658
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,824
I have never, ever done stand-up.

659
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,867
Rory, let me handle this.

660
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,452
Jack's got it.

661
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,665
Rory has never, ever done stand-up
in his life.

662
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,294
Throughout the years, every single time
l've watched a stand-up comedian

663
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,713
or late-night show appearance

664
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,300
of people who've rehearsed their material,
written it, done the research,

665
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,302
done the roadwork, paid their dues.

666
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,178
- Professionalism.
- We've seen that.

667
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,307
What about a guy
who doesn't know what he's doing,

668
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,727
is completely out of his element,
unattractive,

669
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,520
probably not that funny...

670
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,188
What would that be like?

671
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,734
Rory, why would you put this interview
right in the middle of your special?

672
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:44,363
Well, Ben, as a complete amateur,
first-timer stand-up,

673
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,199
I actually don't have a lot of material.

674
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,868
Enough, actually.

675
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,787
So I thought, we'II do a sketch
and put it in the middle.

676
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,205
That'II fill some time.

677
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:58,127
Jack came out.
So that's kind of a cool thing, I think.

678
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:03,215
Plus...

679
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,468
Pl...

680
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,053
Plus...

681
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,185
Um...

682
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,145
No, wait.
That was actually my final thought.

683
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,148
Thrilled. Excited.

684
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:20,983
Ecstatic!

685
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,069
Okay.
Could you move over just a little bit?

686
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,071
Yeah, yeah. Just slide over?

687
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,865
- Getting too close. Is that an adequate...
- Sure.

688
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,409
But the thing is,
when you're that excited,

689
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,495
when you're that into it...

690
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,580
Actually, I would move you over even more.

691
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,498
Come over here?

692
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,459
So you wonder, where are the ideas gonna
come from if I have this much energy,

693
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,919
if l'm this excited?

694
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,629
Since l'm brand-new to the whole process...

695
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,757
Can you stop for a second?
Is there another couch we can bring in?

696
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,386
It's new territory,
something I hadn't done before.

697
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,847
And so just, I was... one word, ecstatic.

698
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,352
What is this stuff?

699
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,646
It's small-batch Kentucky.

700
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,940
I bring it in for all of our guests.

701
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,983
It's a nice, special way to wind up.

702
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,027
- Really kind of you. Thank you.
- Cheers.

703
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,071
- Yeah, cheers.
- Glad I can share it with you.

704
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,781
Smells really great from even this far.

705
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,953
Ooh.

706
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:17,873
Might be fun, maybe you could do
a few jokes now for everybody.

707
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,459
- I... What?
- You should do it.

708
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,211
Okay, yeah. Just right here in the studio?

709
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,088
Yeah, just right here for the audience.

710
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,715
What's best? Kind of be here on the couch?

711
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,926
I would stand up.
It's called stand-up comedy.

712
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,511
Yeah, okay.

713
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,096
- How 'bout...?
- That's right.

714
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,806
- Is this...?
- How 'bout over here maybe?

715
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,391
Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.

716
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,812
- A little bit...
- Flying is, obviously...

717
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,898
No, a little bit farther for a second.
I don't mean to cut you off.

718
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,484
When you get to the airport...

719
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,362
- I would go even farther.
- Okay.

720
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,281
You're getting a lot of shadows.

721
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,075
- You get there, and TSA, they're like...
- No, no. Couple more.

722
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,660
Couple more feet. A little more.

723
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,245
Further out. Okay.

724
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,497
And then you're already nervous to fly.

725
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,791
And another foot.

726
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,626
- Couple bits.
- And there we are.

727
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:07,173
When is TSA finally gonna realize
that we all know the shoe thing?

728
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,257
You know what I mean?

729
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,426
You get to the airport,
they tell you to take your shoes off.

730
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,845
It's like, "Who doesn't know by now?"

731
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,639
Is someone getting to the airport,
like, "What?

732
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,310
I have to take my shoes off?"

733
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,730
If that happens,
arrest and kill that person.

734
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,484
They're probably not terrorists,
but they're holding up the line.

735
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,570
And what is terrorism on a local level?

736
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:32,072
On a local level, what is terrorism?

737
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,201
Holding up the line?
We don't need those people.

738
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,079
"When did this start?" "Kill him!"

739
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,082
And l'm way too far back. "Kill him!

740
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,752
In front of everybody! Everybody watches!

741
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,129
Everyone. No, sweetie, everyone watches.

742
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,341
Everyone. Everyone watches.

743
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,722
Everyone watches.

744
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,140
Never become that."

745
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,853
It's a fuckin' high-pressure situation

746
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,648
the moment you start dealing
with security.

747
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,484
No one gets dressed and undressed
while moving sideways at home,

748
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,570
but goddamn it if you're not
an Olympian when you get there.

749
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,365
Hurry up!

750
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,618
People in tears, like,
"I just want to see my family again!

751
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,624
Am I allowed to leave my pullover on?

752
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,212
Oh, my God!
I forgot to put my wallet in a bin!

753
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,797
What'II happen?"

754
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,972
No wallets!

755
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,937
It's so fuckin' tense.

756
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,440
Like when you're in line with everybody
and you're going through the zigzags,

757
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,901
yeah, you're having the time of your life.

758
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,656
The moment you touch a bin,
you're in the Octagon.

759
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,909
Nobody's your buddy. Nobody's your pal.

760
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,454
They're timing you.
As soon as you touch a bin, go!

761
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,709
"That's as fast as you can go?

762
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,586
How many bins do you need?

763
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,880
Laptop and an iPad?
Where the fuck are you going?"

764
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,679
Then you gotta go through
that goddamn Stargate machine.

765
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,223
What is that?

766
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,184
Why do we just do it? What is it?

767
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,354
If you asked TSA,
"What does this even do?"

768
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,524
They're like, "Well, shows us where
your sweaty spots are,

769
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,900
and then we tackle 'em."

770
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,865
Next time you're at the airport
and you step into that Stargate machine,

771
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,825
look at the person on the other side
and be like,

772
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:42,494
"I guess Los Angeles, 1984, please."

773
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,673
"Sir, please come out."

774
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,301
"Oh. How long was I gone?"

775
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,054
Do all that. "Sir, you can step out."

776
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:02,431
"How long was I gone?

777
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,807
Where am I?"

778
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:06,018
"Very funny, sir.
Please go, get on your flight.

779
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:09,605
You, ma'am, with the baby formula,
why are you here?"

780
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,276
"I think I was sent from the future
to kill a boy."

781
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,528
"Sir, please, grab your bag.
Go get on your flight.

782
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,906
Ma'am, get over here!

783
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,075
Why are you trying to feed infants?"

784
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,835
Anyways, that's my airport jaunt.

785
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:40,344
If you think Jesus was white, you're not
allowed to have an opinion on gun control.

786
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,641
Not everyone's gonna agree.

787
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,770
We know now, more than ever,
education's expensive.

788
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,857
Also some people in the crowd are like,
"But Jesus was white."

789
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,943
And you're doing the best.

790
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,196
I want to live like that.

791
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,656
I can't.

792
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:03,700
I gotta be up here. I gotta look into it.

793
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,372
All l'm saying is,
if you guys want real change,

794
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,708
you gotta limit
some people's ability to vote.

795
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,751
I know.

796
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,712
I know. I know.

797
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,756
It doesn't sound progressive.

798
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,633
Neither does genocide.

799
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,303
People hate genocide.

800
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,139
Why?

801
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,227
Because it's been used horrifically

802
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:34,440
every single time it's been used
throughout history?

803
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,568
That doesn't necessarily
make it a bad thing.

804
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,196
If I told you guys tomorrow

805
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:45,534
that we were gonna round up
all of the racist, homophobic people

806
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:46,910
and kill them,

807
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,121
you're telling me
all the smart people wouldn't be like...

808
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,374
"Well, shit,
we haven't tried that version.

809
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,587
That might actually have an impact."

810
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,006
Maybe it's not based
on skin color or religion.

811
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:02,801
Maybe it's just, "Who's the dick?
Get him out. Get him out of here."

812
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,346
Lump in global warming deniers.
Let's clean house.

813
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,683
You guys get it. You guys are hip.
You're cool. You get it.

814
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,353
l'm one of those people
that doesn't believe in global warming,

815
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,148
but l'm pretty sure Noah's ark
was a true story.

816
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:23,572
Where the guy was warning everybody
about the insane change in the weather,

817
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,325
and everyone's like,
"Shut the fuck up, Noah.

818
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:31,955
Quit hoggin' all the wood
so you can go off and fuck those animals.

819
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,166
Well, that's what it looks like.

820
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,668
That's what it looks like to us, dude.

821
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:40,297
Looks like you're building
some kind of sex ship out there.

822
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,967
If that's not the case,
you need to come down to the pub,

823
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,304
and you need to give a speech,
'cause people are talking, dude.

824
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,723
People are fuckin' talkin'.
We don't know you.

825
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:52,476
We don't know you.
People are chattin', dude.

826
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,770
You're like a thousand.

827
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,023
No one else is a thousand."

828
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:12,412
On the topic of guns,
not everyone here likes guns.

829
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,540
Not everyone here hates guns.

830
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,375
Maybe some guns shouldn't be available.

831
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:20,879
But what we do know for a fact
is that right now,

832
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,341
all of the guns are currently available.

833
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,386
And some people are collecting guns.

834
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:32,474
And some people are picking flowers,
hoping it all goes away one day.

835
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,436
I assure you, it is not going to go away.

836
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,649
You've been led to believe at some point,
it's gonna be us versus them.

837
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,568
We just don't know who "them" is.

838
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:45,571
But in reality,
it's gonna be red versus blue,

839
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,156
and it's gonna be a fuckin' bloodbath.

840
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,035
So while guns are currently available...

841
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,789
consider having a few around.

842
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:58,584
You know, for when the shit hits the fan.

843
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,169
You don't want people barging in
in your house

844
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,589
and you're like,
"I got a ton of steak knives!"

845
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,844
I told my wife,
"I think we should get a gun."

846
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:10,554
She was like, "Why do we need a gun?"

847
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,974
I was like, "I don't know. We're probably
gonna want water in ten years."

848
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,395
I want to live for today
like everybody else,

849
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:20,272
but I gotta live for tomorrow
a little bit.

850
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,357
You know what I mean? Look down the road.

851
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,277
Look down the Fury Road, you guys.

852
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,822
Did anybody see that documentary?

853
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,576
Anybody see that?
"I thought it was a film." Did you?

854
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:37,539
"O.J. hated water. He hated water."

855
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,376
We'd go out, and l'd be like, "O.J.

856
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,837
Need some water."

857
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,010
I will say this. I don't do impressions
'cause l'm shitty at 'em.

858
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,304
But I promise you,
this one is pretty close.

859
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,600
It's pretty close. When you finally watch
that documentary, you're, "Oh, my God.

860
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,730
It's a shame that guy killed himself.
He could have made money doing voices."

861
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,069
You know what?

862
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,236
O.J.

863
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,659
I don't like how some people react
when glass breaks.

864
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,452
Have you seen these people?

865
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:20,540
What if this was my whole show?
"Have you guys seen these people?"

866
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,962
Glass breaks, they're like,
"Nobody touch it!"

867
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,341
Shut the fuck up.

868
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:33,053
This is nobody's first broken glass rodeo.

869
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:38,517
Nobody's running over like,
"Here, let me scoop up a lot of the shards

870
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,727
with my bare forearms.

871
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:45,607
Put all the pieces in my mouth
till I find a trash can at some point.

872
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,694
No, put the shards of glass
into my mouth."

873
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,115
"Nobody walk around with your shoes off."

874
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,991
Are you sure?

875
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,248
When I heard the glass break,
I immediately threw on my bathing suit.

876
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,458
Was that for nothing?

877
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,920
Where's the glass? Yay!

878
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:15,929
Get these "save the dates"
for people's weddings.

879
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:18,306
You guys know what l'm talking about.
The "save the dates."

880
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,225
When did this start? Why did this start?

881
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:23,311
Why was someone like, "You know what?
In advance of the invitation,

882
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,772
let's send our friends a "˜save the date,'

883
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,817
as to say, "˜Psst! Heads up.

884
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,820
Invitation on the way.

885
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,031
You're one of the chosen ones.

886
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,034
That's right. Identical information
on both pieces of paper.

887
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,829
Except on that save the date,

888
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:44,499
you're gonna get a pretty cool,
insecure picture of the two of us.

889
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,960
That's a magnet. Put that on the fridge.

890
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,839
Decorate your home with our faces.'"

891
00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:55,886
You see those pictures,
you're like, "Oh, fuck.

892
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,722
I can't go to this."

893
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:02,017
They're just looking at you like,
"This is what love is, right?

894
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:07,856
We're in a field in the middle of nowhere,
standing next to an abandoned barn.

895
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,066
Come to our wedding.

896
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:13,528
Look at us.
We're spooning backwards while standing,

897
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,239
laughing about something
one of us brought up.

898
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,576
Be at our wedding!

899
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,454
Look, we're on a dock
in the middle of a lake.

900
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:25,040
We don't even live near a lake.
How did we get there?

901
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,249
Love!

902
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:30,420
Love drove us that day
to get those candid photographs.

903
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,381
We didn't even know
the photographer was there.

904
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:35,801
We're just always standing like that."

905
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,972
Also, those pictures,
that's never the dude's idea.

906
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,642
When you get that "save the date,"
and it's like your buddy, you're like,

907
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,769
what the fuck is this?

908
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,230
The dude is never, "You know what?

909
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,817
Let's take one where our foreheads
are touching and our eyes are closed.

910
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,944
You know, as like a backup.

911
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:57,572
As a backup, in case we don't use the one
where l'm shirtless on a horse.

912
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,367
You know."

913
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,621
If you want to invite me to your wedding,
just send me a piece of paper.

914
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,373
Loose-leaf is perfect.

915
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,544
Scribble it with crayon. Save the money.

916
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:13,839
Just send me a piece of paper
that's got the date of the wedding

917
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,883
and tell me if you're gonna have alcohol
at the reception or not.

918
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:19,678
Because if you're not gonna serve alcohol

919
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,763
at your wedding reception,

920
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:25,100
show some balls
and put that on the invitation.

921
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,896
Find out the hard way
how many of your friends and family...

922
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:33,149
truly give a fuck about your wedding.

923
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,918
You get to a reception...
"Yeah, l'II take a beer."

924
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,837
"Oh, we don't have any alcohol."

925
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,882
"Then what the fuck
did I just sit through?

926
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,093
A shitty play?"

927
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:03,388
That's what a wedding is.

928
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:05,765
A wedding is a shitty play.

929
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,768
The only people who like it are in it,
like all plays.

930
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,400
Everybody else is in the audience like,

931
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:19,070
"Twenty more minutes,
we are getting fucked!"

932
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:21,531
"Not at our wedding!

933
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,491
We invited Jesus."

934
00:53:28,246 --> 00:53:30,624
I was at a wedding.
It was a non-alcoholic reception.

935
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,209
I was like, "I hope they get diarrhea
on the honeymoon."

936
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,254
That's not a very nice thing to say.
I was like, "Really?

937
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,715
I was gonna say I hope they die tonight."

938
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:47,057
Nothing gets me on the dance floor
like a big old pint of sweet tea!

939
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:53,939
I like to be fully present in the moment,
fully aware l'm not a good dancer.

940
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,775
The sweet tea reminds me
every step of the way.

941
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,620
l've used a Fleshlight before.

942
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,376
Guys, don't be like that.

943
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,836
Don't be like that.

944
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,674
I was at a show,
doing a festival in Texas.

945
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,926
They gave all the performers a gift bag.

946
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:25,470
In the gift bag
there was a free Fleshlight.

947
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,263
I don't know
if they gave us those as a joke.

948
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,391
I didn't take it as one.

949
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,269
I pulled myself aside...

950
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,816
and immediately reprioritized
my entire afternoon.

951
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:42,237
I said, "Rory, we skipped lunch before.
Didn't kill us then.

952
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,572
Will not kill us now."

953
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,283
"Fuck this thing!"
Out loud in a hotel lobby.

954
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,452
"I gotta get my dick out!

955
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,455
I gotta do it!"

956
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:58,294
Some women in this crowd, you're like,
"I think it's gross he used a Fleshlight."

957
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,923
Some women don't care. Some women
still think I said "flashlight."

958
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,885
Now you know who you are.

959
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,971
So do the people around you.

960
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:11,182
"Well, then what is it?"
"I don't fucking know.

961
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,852
Dude fucking loves 9/11. I don't know.

962
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:15,854
I don't know."

963
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,360
If you're a dude in here, and you think
it's gross that l've used a Fleshlight,

964
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,154
you need to look at the facts.

965
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:27,157
You're in a city that you do not live in,

966
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,951
in a hotel room by yourself.

967
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:34,372
Someone gives you a free Fleshlight.

968
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,417
You can go fuck yourself

969
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,711
if you think
you're not gonna go fuck yourself.

970
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:44,674
You're immediately going
to go fuck yourself

971
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,509
because you have to know.

972
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,928
What is it like?

973
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,348
I know some people are in here,
"Oh, I don't need a sex toy."

974
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,017
Grow up.

975
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,354
If you were out on the sidewalk right now
and someone pulled up in a Ferrari

976
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:02,192
and was like, "Get in," you're not gonna
be like, "But I already have a car."

977
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,820
No. You're gonna get in.

978
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,574
And you're gonna find out the hard way
it's a Kia Rio in disguise.

979
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,791
Here's how they work.

980
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,876
Whoo, this joke is a two-parter.

981
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:25,048
You have to take a fake, rubbery vagina...

982
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,802
out of a flashlight casing

983
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:31,221
and put it in warm water

984
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,014
for five minutes.

985
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,353
Never in your entire life

986
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,480
will you feel more ridiculous.

987
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,819
Standing in a hotel bathroom...

988
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,655
naked, 'cause you're ready.

989
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:52,033
You're ready. You don't know.
You don't know what's about to happen.

990
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:54,119
Be ready. Be naked. Be ready.

991
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,039
Standing over the sink

992
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,210
like a kid who just dropped one of those
dinosaur sponge pills into the water.

993
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:06,131
Can't wait for my vagina to be ready!

994
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,718
I love going on the road!
Brings out the best in me!

995
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,933
When you're doing that
in a hotel bathroom,

996
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,810
there is one other person
in there with you,

997
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,688
and you lock eyes
the moment you look in the mirror.

998
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,191
And he's got questions.

999
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,277
Rory, how did we get here?

1000
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,488
How did we get to this point?

1001
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,615
You're married.

1002
00:57:32,699 --> 00:57:36,327
Surely your wife knows someone
you can sleep with.

1003
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,916
Not a lot of people
ever laugh at that part.

1004
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,503
She certainly wishes
I would stop saying it.

1005
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:50,758
But now we got these cameras.

1006
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,178
Can't go back now.

1007
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,972
It's out there.

1008
00:57:57,223 --> 00:58:00,685
I think what life is actually about...

1009
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:06,191
Now actually... And action.
Now the special is starting. Action.

1010
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,654
I think what life is actually about...

1011
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:15,325
is realizing
that we're all covered in layers

1012
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,535
that we've put there for some reason.

1013
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:19,621
For protection. Whatever reason it is.

1014
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:22,290
The only way you're gonna get to know
who you truly are

1015
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:25,752
and expose your true self to everyone else

1016
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,879
is to get rid of those layers.

1017
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,840
And you see some people
get rid of those layers at a young age.

1018
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,634
You see they have a very happy life.

1019
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:36,304
Then you see some people that are your age
who haven't removed one layer.

1020
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,556
You're like, "Ooh."

1021
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:43,186
That's the layer that I removed that day.

1022
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,565
I found out...

1023
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:50,068
that l'm a guy

1024
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,153
who will just fuck whatever you got.

1025
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,162
What have you got over there,
a pile of inanimate objects?

1026
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,839
Cool if I put my dick in 'em?

1027
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,969
l'm one of those people.

1028
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,556
l'd fuck a fake ass, if you had one.

1029
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:22,225
Don't act like
you don't know what that is.

1030
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,228
Nobody can clear their pop-ups that fast.

1031
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,856
Not saying you have one,
but you know what's on the market.

1032
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,443
No legs, no torso.
It's just an ass that you have sex with.

1033
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:35,405
Yes, the show is surprisingly bookended.

1034
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:56,926
I hope that's the point that the guy was
taking an hour-long shit comes back in.

1035
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,392
"Why are you still watching this?"
"You missed a lot of other stuff.

1036
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,104
He hates women."

1037
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,033
I looked at one of those fake asses
for about five...

1038
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,535
Shut up, guys. Not now.

1039
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,954
Not this close to the end.
Don't you leave me.

1040
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,249
Lock those doors. They are locked?
So all the doors are locked.

1041
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,880
I looked at one of those things
for five minutes.

1042
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,383
I was like, "You know what?
If no one was ever gonna know,

1043
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,260
then, yeah, l'II have sex with it.

1044
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,888
l'm gonna jerk off anyway."
Fellas, am I right?

1045
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,153
The shittiest choreographed ending.

1046
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:07,080
All right. Just me. Just me.

1047
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,749
I thought we'd all stand up
and get into it, but...

1048
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,002
Women, I don't know
if you know this about men...

1049
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:17,298
but when we're in our 20s
and our brain is, "Jerk off right now,"

1050
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:20,385
we're like, "You got it. You got it."

1051
01:01:22,428 --> 01:01:25,431
When we're in our 30s
and our brain is, "Jerk off right now,"

1052
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,642
I promise you, all of us are like,

1053
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,645
"When the fuck does this stop?

1054
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,858
I don't wanna do this shit anymore.

1055
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:38,569
It's been 20 goddamn years.

1056
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,780
I haven't liked it for ten.

1057
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,658
I just kept doing it
'cause I thought l'd die.

1058
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,494
Stay away from me...

1059
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:49,622
and stay away from my family."

1060
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:56,087
My question is,
if you buy one of those fake asses...

1061
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,673
where do you even keep that?

1062
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,427
"I keep mine under the bed."

1063
01:02:02,510 --> 01:02:04,345
Do you, you lunatic?

1064
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:09,517
I would rather my child find
a loaded gun in the house.

1065
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:15,314
Far less awkward than the day
my kid comes into the kitchen,

1066
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,483
"Daddy, what's this?"

1067
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:20,570
Well, that's kind of your mom
when she's out of town.

1068
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:24,198
You guys, thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

1069
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:27,452
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

1070
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,370
Thank you so much.

1071
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:57,523
Rory! Rory! Rory!

1072
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,610
Rory! Rory! Ror...

1073
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:05,948
Oh, this is fantas... Guys!
This is the best.

1074
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,075
You guys do this at the end of every show?
