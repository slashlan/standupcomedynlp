Ever notice that? Right?

'Cause I used to have really long hair,
and I'd wear it in a ponytail every day

I think it's more than my hair
that gives off the vibe,

00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:54,151
'cause sometimes
I'm a little tomboy, right?

40
00:02:54,276 --> 00:02:56,486
Like, I call everybody "bro."
"Hey, what's up, bro?"

Or, like,
if somebody gives me a compliment,

49
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,047
I usually just say,
"Oh, thank you," right?

62
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:51,791

I live in Los Angeles,
so every now and then

66
00:03:59,341 --> 00:04:02,344
I have to go to these, like,
red carpet Hollywood events

67
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:04,054
where you get dressed up all nice

68
00:04:04,137 --> 00:04:07,098
and you walk the red carpet
and they take pictures of you

69
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:10,435
and they go,
"Anjelah, who are you wearing?"

70
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,479
"Oh, uh... Forever 21!"

[laughter]

75
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,995
"They're gold, but now
they're like rose gold."

76
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,921
I'm not fancy.

77
00:04:38,004 --> 00:04:40,424
Even on planes.
I'm not fancy on planes, you guys.

78
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,300
Like, my husband and I
just flew to Europe.

79
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:46,054
And we flew first-class,
but it was like a fancy first-class

80
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:48,514
where, like, everybody got
their own private, individual,

81
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,059
like, spaceship-type seat

82
00:04:51,268 --> 00:04:53,478
and there was all kinds
of buttons everywhere.

83
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:58,149
So I was a little confused at first.
I was like, "Wait a minute. Uh...

84
00:04:58,233 --> 00:04:59,776
am I flying the plane?"

85
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:01,819
[laughter]

86
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,910
"Uh, excuse me.

87
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:10,828
Um...

88
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:13,164
I didn't do real good in school."

89
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,749
[laughter]

90
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,296
And, like, all I wanted to do
was lean my chair back a little bit

91
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,214
so I could relax while
I was watching my movie, right?

92
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:24,468
So I'm trying to find
the "lean back a little bit" button.

93
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:28,138
"Okay, that's it right here.

94
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,848
That's good."

95
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:32,892
[laughter]

96
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,896
"I'm laying down.

97
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:41,067
I'll just sit up. It's fine."

98
00:05:43,487 --> 00:05:45,571
[laughter]

99
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:59,836
- "This how rich people sit?"
- [laughter]

100
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,173
It was fancy.
[chuckling]

101
00:06:03,298 --> 00:06:06,134
And they had hundreds of movies
for us to choose from, right?

102
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:08,345
We were going to Europe,
so I wanted to be prepared

103
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,305
for all I was about to experience there.

104
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:13,016
So I decided to watch the movie, <i>Taken.</i>

105
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:15,726
[laughter]

106
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,313
It's a good movie.

107
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:24,361
At one point, I leaned over to my husband.
I was like, "Uh, babe...

108
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:27,030
- don't get taken."
- [laughter]

109
00:06:28,323 --> 00:06:30,575
"'Cause I ain't gonna
be able to find you."

110
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:33,495
Serious, this guy is so smart...
Liam Neeson.

111
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:35,663
He's, like, the smartest guy in the world.

112
00:06:35,746 --> 00:06:36,706
[audience cheers]

113
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:38,833
You guys, if you ever hear
about me getting kidnapped,

114
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:42,962
don't call the police.
Call Liam Neeson, please.

115
00:06:43,046 --> 00:06:47,300
This guy is solving crimes
from across the world on the phone.

116
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:48,885

119
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:58,311
He's gonna figure it out.

120
00:06:58,395 --> 00:07:01,272
Talking about,
"Is the wind blowing to the east?"

121
00:07:01,356 --> 00:07:03,358
[laughter]

122
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,776
"Uh, which way the east, Liam Neeson?"

123

[laughter]

124
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:12,283
If I ever meet Liam Neeson in person,

125
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,827
I think I'm just gonna start crying...

126
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:17,121
'cause that means that he found me.

[audience cheering]

129
00:07:32,429 --> 00:07:34,222
Told all our friends
we were going to Europe, right?

130
00:07:34,347 --> 00:07:35,681
They started warning us right away.

131
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,518
Like, "You're going to Europe?
Watch out for gypsies."

132
00:07:38,602 --> 00:07:40,353
I'm like, "Gypsies?

133
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:42,355
What's 'gypsies'?

134
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:43,940
Like Egyptians?"

00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:48,778
"Are they mad at us?
Did we do something to them?"

137
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,655
[laughter]

138
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:52,156
They're like, "No, gypsies.

139
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:54,200
They will rob you and take
all your stuff, right?

140
00:07:54,325 --> 00:07:56,953
They got all kind of gypsies.
They got old lady gypsies,

141
00:07:57,078 --> 00:07:58,622
little kid gypsies,

142
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,873
sneaky squirrel gypsies."

143
00:08:00,957 --> 00:08:02,459
[laughter]

144
00:08:03,668 --> 00:08:05,753
My road manager Lauren,
she used to live in Europe,

145
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:08,256
so she even told me...
She was like, "Okay, listen.

146
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:10,550
If a woman comes up to you

147
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:14,262
and throws her baby at you,
don't catch it."

148
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,055
[laughter]

149
00:08:18,683 --> 00:08:21,478
I'm like, "Just let the baby fall?"

150
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,813
She's like, "Yeah, 'cause
as soon as you catch her baby,

151
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,773
all her gypsy friends are gonna
stick their hands in your purse

152
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,858
and your pockets and take all your stuff."

153
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,903
I'm like, "Da-a-a-ng!

154
00:08:30,987 --> 00:08:33,156
Well, that's dedication."

155

[laughter]

156
00:08:35,992 --> 00:08:40,037
Shoot, at that point I think
she kind of earned my stuff.

157
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:42,790
Right? 'Cause, like, if you're
throwing your baby at someone,

158
00:08:42,915 --> 00:08:46,336
that's straight dedication
to the game right there.

159
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:48,004
Respect.

160
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,552

gonna throw her baby at me,

00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:57,347
she's gonna trust that, one,
I'm gonna catch her baby, right?

162
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:59,932
And that, two,
I'm gonna give her baby back.

163
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:02,727
- [laughter]
- You know what I'm saying?

164
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,688
'Cause, like, what if she throw
her baby at me and I miss?

165
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,524
Now her baby on the floor
with a concussion.

166
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,109
Right?
Or what if she got a really cute baby

167
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:12,820
and I don't want to give it back?
You know what I mean?

168
00:09:12,945 --> 00:09:14,531
Like what if it's a half-Black,
half-Asian baby?

169
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,282
I'm gonna keep that one.

170
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:18,075
[laughter]

171
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,918
But now I have the upper hand
in negotiations, right?

172
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:29,671
Like, "Oh, you want your baby back?

173
00:09:29,795 --> 00:09:32,089
Now you want your baby back.
Give me my iPhone."

174
00:09:32,173 --> 00:09:33,717
[laughter]

175
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,093
"You can keep my wallet.
I'll cancel my credit cards.

176
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,763
I need my phone book contacts."

177
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:40,557
'Cause I don't know
anybody's phone number by heart.

178
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,600
You guys know people's
phone number by heart?

179
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:45,228
No, right? Like, I know nobody...

180
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,313
my mom, my husband...
nobody's phone number.

181
00:09:47,522 --> 00:09:49,566
If I'm in an emergency situation
and people are like,

182
00:09:49,691 --> 00:09:52,402
"Hurry, give us your mother's phone number
so we can call her,"

183
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:54,738
I'd be like, "Okay. It's 'Mom.'"

184
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,406
[laughter]

185
00:09:58,824 --> 00:10:00,910
"Right. What's her phone number?"

186
00:10:01,035 --> 00:10:03,329
"M-O-M."

187
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,497
[laughter]

188
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,211
Let's just hope they don't ask me
for my husband's phone number.

189
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,962
"Hurry, give us
your husband's phone number."

190
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:14,090
"Okay, it's Pooky Boo Lover Buns."

191
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:15,759
[laughter]

192
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:22,056
By the time we landed, I was hyped.

193
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:24,434
Like, I was ready to fight somebody.

194
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:27,353
Right? Every time I saw a baby,
I was flinching.

195
00:10:27,478 --> 00:10:29,980
[laughter]

196
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:32,191
Just, like, punching random strangers
for no reason.

197
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,406
I'd just finished watching <i>Taken.</i>
I think everybody's trying to kidnap me.

198
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:39,490
We were checking in at the hotel.

199
00:10:39,616 --> 00:10:42,368
The guy at the front desk, he was nice.
He was like, "Welcome.

200
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:44,829
Would you like some help
with your bags up to your room?"

201
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:47,290
I was like... [chuckles]
"No, gypsy."

202
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:48,833
[laughter]

203
00:10:50,668 --> 00:10:52,962
"Hmm, nice try."

204
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:55,131
Our first stop was Rome, Italy.

205
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,800
It was awesome, you guys.

206
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,554
We went to the Forum,
the Vatican, the Colosseum.

207
00:11:01,763 --> 00:11:04,808
And, like,
this trip really made me realize

208
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:07,351
that I should have paid attention
in school.

209
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,145
[laughter]

210
00:11:09,228 --> 00:11:11,105
For real, 'cause, like,
all I kept thinking was,

211
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:14,442
"Man, if I didn't cut class
all throughout high school,

212
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,069
I would probably be having fun right now."

213
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,072
I mean, but it was still cool.

214
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:23,033
Even if you're not a history buff,
like, it was still pretty amazing.

215
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:25,870
Like, 'cause I was standing there
in front of the Colosseum,

216
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:28,038
just really, like, almost emotional,
'cause I'm like,

217
00:11:28,247 --> 00:11:31,751
"Dang, I cannot believe that,
like, right here, years ago,

218
00:11:31,876 --> 00:11:35,296
is where they filmed
the movie, <i>Gladiator."</i>

219
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:36,756
You know what I'm saying?
Like, Russell Crowe

220
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,634
- could've been right here.
- [laughter]

221
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:42,512
- Poof!
- [laughter]

222
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:50,854
After that, we took
an 11-hour train ride to Paris.

223
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:54,315
Let me tell you,
an 11-hour anything is terrible.

224
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,566
[laughter]

225
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,026
To anything, like, even a massage.

226
00:11:57,151 --> 00:11:59,529
Everybody likes a massage.
Go for an hour, maybe two hours.

227
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:02,448
But 11 hours, your skin gonna fall off.

228
00:12:02,532 --> 00:12:04,492
[laughter]

229
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:05,827
And, like, I don't know
what I was thinking,

230
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:07,036
'cause we could've jumped on a plane

231
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,830
and been there
in like five minutes, right?

232
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:11,791
But in my mind I thought
it was gonna be romantic, right?

233
00:12:11,957 --> 00:12:14,669
I was like,
"Oh, let's take a train to Paris.

234
00:12:14,752 --> 00:12:16,212
It'll be so romantic.

235
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,297
Like, there'll be a caboose in the back

236
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:20,925
where they're dancing,
wearing flapper dresses,

237
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,260
celebrating 'The War Is Over.'"

238
00:12:23,386 --> 00:12:25,054
[laughter]

239
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,268
It's not like that.

240
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:33,103
[laughter]

241
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:35,231
If you've never been
on an overnight train,

242
00:12:35,356 --> 00:12:36,982
let me just paint the picture for you.

243
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,068
I almost died that night.

244
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:40,570
[laughter]

245
00:12:40,737 --> 00:12:43,573
The smell on this train was so bad,

246
00:12:43,698 --> 00:12:47,368
it literally almost choked me to death.

247
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,120
Have you ever tried
to hold your breath for 11 hours?

248
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,540
[laughter]

249
00:12:52,623 --> 00:12:55,543
I almost died. And there would've been
nobody to charge in my murder.

250
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,379
They would have been,
"Oh, my God, who killed her?"

251
00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:01,298
- "Smell."
- [laughter]

252
00:13:01,382 --> 00:13:03,092
"Smell killed her."

253
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:07,388
This is what it's like. You get
on the train, and they have cabins,

254
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:09,306
and there are six bunk beds in each cabin.

255
00:13:09,473 --> 00:13:11,392
If you don't buy all six bunk beds,

256
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:13,853
they just stick some rando
in there with you.

257
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:15,646
So good luck, okay?

258
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:17,440
So this is what it's like.
We get on the train,

259
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:19,442
and in the first cabin
there's a Chinese family,

260
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,819
then there's a Haitian family,
then there's us Americans,

261
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:23,487
and then there's, like, an Italian family,

262
00:13:23,613 --> 00:13:25,114
then a French family.

263
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,324
Like, there's just all kind
of different people, right?

264
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:29,994
- Like, it's kind of like a buffet.
- [laughter]

265
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,245
Go with me for a second.

266
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,330
Like, you know how sometimes
you go to a buffet

267
00:13:33,456 --> 00:13:35,374
and they got the seafood
and the Italian food,

268
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:37,794
and then they got the Chinese food
right next to the barbecue?

269
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,670
And you're like,
"Wait, that's too many smells.

270
00:13:39,796 --> 00:13:42,172
- I can't figure it out."
- [laughter]

271
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:46,719
It was kind of like that, except it was
like a two-week-old buffet.

272
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:48,345
[laughter, groaning]

273
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:50,097
Yeah, it wasn't fresh.

274
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:56,896
And, like, I'm not really a diva, okay?

275
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:59,857
I don't consider myself a diva,
but that night, it was questionable.

276
00:13:59,941 --> 00:14:01,525
[laughter]

277
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,570
'Cause, like, I just kept trying to
find somebody that worked on the train.

278
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:06,990
Like, "Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Um...

279
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:11,410
can you point me into the direction
where passengers can breathe?"

280
00:14:11,494 --> 00:14:13,037
[laughter]

281
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:18,334
"Yeah, similar to this,
but preferably unscented."

282
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:19,919
[laughter]

283
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,463
"Oh, this is the only section?

284
00:14:22,588 --> 00:14:25,174
Oh, okay...

285
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:29,679
'cause we bought a first-class ticket

286
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:33,599
and it's not really a first-class smell."

287
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:35,184
- [forced chuckle]
- [laughter]

288
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,061
[growls]

289
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:39,104
[laughter]

290
00:14:41,482 --> 00:14:44,986
"Okay."
[chuckling]

291
00:14:45,069 --> 00:14:46,863
"Just go back to my seat? Okay, thanks."

292
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:48,447
[chuckling]

293
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:51,826
I felt like I was being
human-trafficked into Paris.

294
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:53,870
I kept looking for Liam Neeson.

295
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,414
I couldn't find him.

296
00:14:57,498 --> 00:15:00,084
When we got to Paris,
we went to the Louvre.

297
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,294
That's where they filmed
that movie, <i>The Da Vinci Code.</i>

298
00:15:02,378 --> 00:15:04,254
[laughter]

299
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:08,258
I kept trying to reenact the scenes,
but they don't like it when you do that.

300
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:10,594
And the bridge that you walk across
to get to the Louvre

301
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,638
is, like, the lovers bridge, right?

302
00:15:12,763 --> 00:15:14,598
Where you go with your lover,
you get a lock,

303
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,392
you lock it onto the bridge

304
00:15:16,517 --> 00:15:18,268
and then you throw
your key into the river,

305
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:21,271
and it's supposed to be like
you're locked in love forever, right?

306
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:25,026
So we did that, but our lock
came with two keys,

307
00:15:25,109 --> 00:15:26,276
so I threw one in the river.

308
00:15:26,402 --> 00:15:30,364
I kept one in my pocket just in case
this fool act up. You know what I mean?

309
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:32,241
Don't play with me. Click.

310
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:35,536
[cheering]

311
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,252
It was an awesome trip.
My husband and I had a great time.

312
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:48,340
And some of you may know that my husband
is actually a Christian rapper.

313
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,384
- Yes.
- [cheering]

314
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:55,222
Uh, most of you probably didn't even know
Christian rap was a thing.

315
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:58,059
- [laughter]
- Oh, it's a thing.

316
00:15:58,183 --> 00:16:00,770
- Yeah, it's legit.
- [laughter]

317
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:03,898
Don't get caught sleepin'
on that Christian rap game, homie.

318
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,482
[laughter]

319
00:16:05,608 --> 00:16:07,944
His last album went
triple Pentecost platinum.

320
00:16:08,069 --> 00:16:10,279
[laughter]

321
00:16:10,362 --> 00:16:11,739
Booyah.

322
00:16:11,822 --> 00:16:13,866
[laughter]

323
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,496
My husband is
a Christian rapper, right?

324
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,709
And I'm a Christian and I'm a comedian,
but I'm not a Christian comedian.

325
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,086
[laughter]

326
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:28,464
Let me explain.

327
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,758
[laughter]

328
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:32,384
I don't have jokes that are like,

329
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:36,055
"So Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
walk into a bar."

330
00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:38,182
[laughter]

331
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:39,516
"Sinners."

332
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,435
[laughter]

333
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:48,692
It's not my style.

334
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:51,654
And, like, a lot of my comic friends,
they always tell me,

335
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:53,864
"Oh, you're so conservative."
Right?

336
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:56,826
And then my Christian friends are like,
"Oh, you're so edgy."

337
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,535
[laughter]

338
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:00,454
But, like, I just do me.
You know what I mean?

339
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:03,082
Like, I can't be anybody else but me.

340
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,417
- [cheers and applause]
- Right?

341
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:09,172
Just do you and do you well.
You know what I'm sayin'?

342
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:12,049
Like, I'll tell you the truth.
I love Jesus, okay?

343
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,927
- [cheers and applause]
- Yes, I do.

344
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,013
But I will punch a ho.

345
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:21,142
[cheers and applause]

346
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:32,277
I mean, like, I don't want to.

347
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,779
[laughter]

348
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:37,241
You know what I'm saying?
Like, I don't want to fight you.

349
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:41,328
Like, if you're yelling at me, go ahead
and yell at me. I don't even care.

350
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:44,165
You wanna say some curse words at me,
say some curse words.

351
00:17:44,248 --> 00:17:45,749
I don't even care.

352
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:51,047
But if you are right here...
in my face?

353
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:54,383
- Like, if our eyelashes...
- [laughter]

354
00:17:56,301 --> 00:17:59,680
- is braided together...
- [laughter]

355
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,475
I will cut... you.

356
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:06,062
[cheers and applause]

357
00:18:16,906 --> 00:18:19,158
In the name of Jesus.

358
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:21,160
[laughter, cheering]

359
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:32,546
We're in Southern California, so there's
probably some cholos here tonight.

360
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:34,339
[laughter]

361
00:18:34,548 --> 00:18:36,175
I see you, Boo.

362
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,927
[laughter]

363
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:41,638
Uh, recently I was invited
to cholo church.

364
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:43,224
[laughter]

365
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,646
It's kind of like regular church...
but a little different.

366
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:50,814
[laughter]

367
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:55,360
Right? 'Cause, like, at regular church
they're very warm and inviting.

368
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:58,488
"Hi. Welcome to Christ
For The Nations Baptist Church.

369
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:01,491
Come on in. Two of you? Okay.
It's your first time here?

370
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:03,953
Come sit up in the front,
closer to the anointing.

371
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:06,371
Up in the front. Two seats.
Thank you. Two seats.

372
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:08,540
Praise the Lord. Hallelujah."

373
00:19:08,665 --> 00:19:10,251
[laughter]

374
00:19:16,048 --> 00:19:19,135
It's a different congregation
at cholo church.

375
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,636
[laughter]

376
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,391
The people at cholo church, the Lord has
really brought them through some stuff.

377
00:19:26,475 --> 00:19:28,311
And by stuff, I mean 10 to 15.

378
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,569
This is how the guy
was giving the announcements

379
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:40,697
when I first walked in to cholo church.

380
00:19:41,824 --> 00:19:44,534
"Yeah, what's up, eh?
Church about to get started.

381
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,536
I'm gonna have to ask y'all
to take your seats.

382
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:49,665
If you don't have a seat,
one will be appointed to you."

383
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,959
[laughter]

384
00:19:52,168 --> 00:19:54,419
"Yeah, what's up, eh?
You need some seats in the back?

385
00:19:54,544 --> 00:19:57,298
You need some seats? <i>Sabes que,</i>
come right here in the front."

386
00:19:57,422 --> 00:19:59,549
- [laughter]
- "Come right here in the front.

387
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:01,135
What I say?

388
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,806
Why you acting all scared for?"

389
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,308
[laughter]

390
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:13,689
"Uh, you're pointing at me
with your hand shaped like a gun.

391
00:20:13,814 --> 00:20:16,359
It's literally a handgun."

392
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,818
[laughter]

393
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,782
But this church was legit, though.
I gotta give 'em that.

394
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:25,575
They were straight-up.
They were legit.

395
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:29,621
Like, when I say you could
see Jesus on him, I mean literally,

396
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:33,209
- 'cause he had Him tattooed right here.
- [laughter]

397
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,211
Straight dedicated.

398
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:36,795
[laughter]

399
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,429
My husband and I
been married for three years.

400
00:20:45,512 --> 00:20:47,348
- [cheers, applause]
- Thank you.

401
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:51,643
I'm learning a lot, you guys.

402
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,730
I'm learning about marriage,
I'm learning about my husband.

403
00:20:54,855 --> 00:20:58,401
One thing I learned
about my husband is that, um...

404
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,277
he's not real handy.

405
00:21:00,403 --> 00:21:02,446
[laughter]

406
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:05,532
Like, he don't really like
to fix stuff around the house.

407
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:09,203
It's not that he doesn't like to,
it's just that he can't.

408
00:21:10,954 --> 00:21:14,750
And, like, to me, a guy
who could fix stuff, like, that's hot.

409
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:16,543
Any ladies in here agree that's hot?

410
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:17,836
[cheering]

411
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:19,213
Right?

412
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:21,298
That's hot.

413
00:21:21,465 --> 00:21:23,759
Like, you could be
real ugly in the face...

414
00:21:23,884 --> 00:21:25,344
[laughter]

415
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:29,890
- ...but if you could fix my plumbing...
- [laughter]

416
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:32,268
- ...and rewire some cables...
- [women cheering]

417
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:34,186
...ooh, girl, that's hot.

418
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:35,604
[laughter]

419
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:38,815
My poor husband.

420
00:21:40,025 --> 00:21:44,529
He cannot fix an appliance
to save our lives. I'm serious.

421
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:50,411
If our lives depended on my husband
fixing the microwave clock

422
00:21:50,494 --> 00:21:51,745
for daylight savings...

423
00:21:51,828 --> 00:21:53,997
[laughter]

424
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:56,166
...we are gonna die.

425
00:22:01,255 --> 00:22:02,756
But it's okay,
'cause you know what?

426
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:06,260
What he lacks in handiness,
he makes up for in actual hotness,

427
00:22:06,343 --> 00:22:08,345
'cause he's real purty.
[chuckles]

428
00:22:09,972 --> 00:22:11,974
- Don't hate.
- [laughter]

429
00:22:13,976 --> 00:22:15,685
He's real good-looking.

430
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:17,396
He's, like, way better-looking than me.

431
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,148
Like, in our relationship,

432
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,191
I'm the one with the good personality.

433
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,026
[laughter]

434
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,825
Another thing I've learned
about my husband is, uh,

435
00:22:29,908 --> 00:22:32,995
we don't really like
the same sexy-time music.

436
00:22:35,331 --> 00:22:37,124
It's kind of important.

437
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:40,461
'Cause recently my husband,
he's trying to set the mood, right?

438
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:42,463
"I'm putting on some sexy-time music."

439
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:43,922
[laughter]

440
00:22:44,006 --> 00:22:46,300
But to me, it sounded like a church song.

441
00:22:46,383 --> 00:22:48,344
[laughter]

442
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,641
I said, "Uh, babe, what is this?"

443
00:22:54,724 --> 00:22:56,519
He says, "A love song."

444
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,398
I said, "Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
it's a love song to Jesus."

445
00:23:01,482 --> 00:23:03,650
[laughter]

446
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:06,529
"What we trying to do, get our praise on
or get our freak on? What's happenin'?"

447
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:12,826
"You trying to multitask me?
That's what you're trying to do?"

448
00:23:12,951 --> 00:23:14,537
[laughter]

449
00:23:22,336 --> 00:23:25,464
Listen, you guys...
I have some advice, okay?

450
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,343
Take it or leave it. Whatever you want.

451
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:37,684
If you are trying to have sexy time
while listening to Pandora,

452
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:41,355
upgrade to the commercial-free version,
please.

453
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:43,607
[laughter]

454
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:54,993
I mean,
'cause the last thing you want to hear is:

455
00:23:55,118 --> 00:23:57,413
[singing percussive beats]

456
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:58,622
"Hey, girl."

457
00:23:58,747 --> 00:24:00,165
[percussive beats]

458
00:24:00,374 --> 00:24:02,167
"Are you in good hands with Allstate?"

459
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:03,668
[laughter]

460
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:13,095
- Well, I was in good hands.
- [laughter]

461
00:24:15,305 --> 00:24:17,349
But now I just wanna pay some bills.

462
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,351
[laughter]

463
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:25,524
I remember our first emergency.

464
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:29,570
I had to rush my husband to the hospital
because he had kidney stones.

465
00:24:29,653 --> 00:24:31,947
- [audience] Aww.
- I know. And I had heard a while back...

466
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:37,369
Somebody told me the most pain a man
can ever feel is kidney stones, right?

467
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:40,247
So, like, I'm trying to keep
that thought in my mind

468
00:24:40,372 --> 00:24:44,042
as I'm looking at my husband
who is, like, hunched over in pain,

469
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:47,630
moaning, groaning, crying a little bit.

470
00:24:47,712 --> 00:24:49,465
[laughter]

471
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:50,715
'Cause I'll be honest, you guys.

472
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,220
There were a couple times
where I did think to myself, like,

473
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:58,515
"Mm, you need to man up."

474
00:24:58,723 --> 00:25:00,100
[laughter]

475
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:09,109
Right?
'Cause my husband, he's over here like...

476
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:12,028
[groans]
"Babe, it hurts! Babe, it hurts!"

477
00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:14,323
And I'm just like, "Babe."

478
00:25:14,406 --> 00:25:17,576
[laughter]

479
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,785
"What's wrong?"

480
00:25:18,868 --> 00:25:21,413
[laughter]

481
00:25:21,497 --> 00:25:22,872
"What's it feel like?"

482
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,333
[laughter]

483
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,629
"Like a cramp?"

484
00:25:28,712 --> 00:25:31,715
[laughter, applause]

485
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:34,968
[audience cheering]

486
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,060
[laughter]

487
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,857
"Is it like a period?

488
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,693
[laughter]

489
00:25:52,277 --> 00:25:53,529
[groans]

490
00:25:53,612 --> 00:25:55,030
[laughter]

491
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,410
"Oh, you want me
to take you to the hospital."

492
00:26:00,536 --> 00:26:01,870
[laughter]

493
00:26:03,121 --> 00:26:04,414
"You're funny."

494
00:26:08,377 --> 00:26:10,086
"Just grab the heating pad."

495
00:26:10,212 --> 00:26:11,672
[laughter]

496
00:26:16,968 --> 00:26:20,681
Ladies, I tried to tell him just curl up
in a ball and rock back and forth.

497
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:22,766
[laughter]

498
00:26:25,101 --> 00:26:27,437
It didn't work.

499
00:26:27,563 --> 00:26:29,565
And the thing was,
we were about to go to bed, right?

500
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:33,360
And I wasn't feeling well,
so I had just taken NyQuil.

501
00:26:33,485 --> 00:26:38,031
So I'm trying to rush my husband
to the hospital, dozing at the wheel.

502
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:43,662
By the time we get there,
he's dying in pain, I'm intoxicated.

503
00:26:43,746 --> 00:26:45,748
The doctor's trying
to communicate with us,

504
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:49,876
like, "Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on here?

505
00:26:49,959 --> 00:26:52,128
Um, who drove you guys here?"

506
00:26:52,212 --> 00:26:53,296
[laughter]

507
00:26:53,422 --> 00:26:56,007
And I was just like, "Um...

508
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:58,552
Your Honor?"

509
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:00,763
[laughter]

510
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:14,234
"Can I say something?"

511
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:16,319
[laughter]

512
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,198
"I drove us guys here."

513
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:22,576
[laughter]

514
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:24,536
"But I have an excuse.

515
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,995
I'm on NyQuil.

516
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:30,041
He's just a baby."

517
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,544
[laughter]

518
00:27:32,628 --> 00:27:34,463
So they admitted us both.

519
00:27:34,546 --> 00:27:35,964
[laughter]

520
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:38,717
It's pretty expensive.
[chuckles]

521
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:41,678
Right now everybody's talking about
affordable health care, right?

522
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:43,722
But, for me, my health care
has always been affordable

523
00:27:43,847 --> 00:27:47,892
because my cousin June
is my primary doctor. And, uh...

524
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:52,230
Although June has never been
to medical school before.

525
00:27:53,565 --> 00:27:58,278
She works front desk at a doctor's office,
so... she hears a lot.

526
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:01,906
She wears scrubs to work.
I trust her.

527
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,867
[laughter]

528
00:28:04,075 --> 00:28:06,161
Sometimes I call her for advice.
I'll be like,

529
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:08,163
"Hey, June, I'm really congested.
What should I do?"

530
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:09,998
And she'll be like,
"Okay, this is what you wanna do.

531
00:28:10,123 --> 00:28:12,959
You want to get a cup of hot water,
squeeze a whole lemon into it.

532
00:28:13,084 --> 00:28:14,837
One teaspoon of hot sauce,
one teaspoon of pepper.

533
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,921
It'll clear you right up."

534
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:21,426
I'm like, "Okay, first of all,
this prescription sounds delicious."

535
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:22,803
[laughter]

536
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:26,097
"I'm gonna be real honest with you.

537
00:28:26,222 --> 00:28:28,851
I'm probably gonna make some extra
and eat it with chips later."

538
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:33,689
My problem was, I would take advice
from anybody wearing scrubs

539
00:28:33,772 --> 00:28:36,733
just because they look
smarter than me, right?

540
00:28:36,817 --> 00:28:40,904
I used to until I realized
that there's a store in the mall

541
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,198
where anybody could buy scrubs.

542
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,659
[laughter]

543
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:49,371
You don't have to be a doctor, you don't
have to show a license, nothing.

544
00:28:49,496 --> 00:28:50,955
You just walk in,
pick your favorite color,

545
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,666
boom, Dr. Anjelah.

546
00:28:52,749 --> 00:28:54,167
[laughter]

547
00:28:54,334 --> 00:28:55,585
So I'm gonna do it, you guys.

548
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:57,295
I'm gonna go buy myself
some scrubs, okay?

549
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,088
I'm gonna use 'em as my pajamas.

550
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:00,883
I'm gonna sleep in them at night.

551
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,384
Then I'm gonna wake up
early in the morning,

552
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:03,886
throw on some tennis shoes,

553
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,054
run over to Starbucks
for my morning coffee

554
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,557
where everybody keeps letting me
cut in front of them in line

555
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:11,976
'cause they just assume I got off
a late-night shift at the hospital,

556
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,353
saving lives.

557
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:14,813
[laughter]

558
00:29:15,146 --> 00:29:17,273
[cheering]

559
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:18,775
Yeah.

560
00:29:18,983 --> 00:29:21,820
No, yeah, it's a genius plan,
you know,

561
00:29:21,986 --> 00:29:24,948
until there's an actual
emergency at Starbucks.

562
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:26,616
[laughter]

563
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,326
Right? Could you guys imagine that?

564
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:31,663
Some guy at Starbucks lying
on the ground, having a seizure?

565
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:34,958
Everybody's looking at me like,
"Oh, thank God you're here."

566
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,209
[laughter]

567
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,878
Right? What am I gonna do?

568
00:29:38,002 --> 00:29:40,881
Tell him a joke,
hope he laughs his seizure away?

569
00:29:40,964 --> 00:29:42,716
[laughter]

570
00:29:42,966 --> 00:29:44,927
This is what I would do, you guys, okay?

571
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:48,346
I would get in real low, right,
so nobody else could hear me,

572
00:29:48,388 --> 00:29:53,810
and I'd just be like,
"Um... excuse me. Sir?

573
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,690
- Hi."
- [laughter]

574
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:03,904
"Okay, listen. Um...

575
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:05,906
these are just my pajamas."

576
00:30:05,989 --> 00:30:08,074
[laughter]

577
00:30:08,157 --> 00:30:10,243
"Yeah, anybody could buy them.

578
00:30:12,161 --> 00:30:14,330
Okay, look, I'm not a real doctor,

579
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:17,793
but don't worry about it 'cause
I'm gonna give it my best shot.

580
00:30:18,001 --> 00:30:20,003
All right, I got this.
Everybody move back, please.

581
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:22,297
Move back. I need some space.
Everybody step back.

582
00:30:22,422 --> 00:30:23,757
Okay, you call 9-1-1.

583
00:30:23,966 --> 00:30:27,928
You, give me a skinny vanilla latte
and a breakfast sandwich.

584
00:30:28,011 --> 00:30:32,557
You, I need a cup of hot water,
some lemon and some hot sauce, stat."

585
00:30:32,766 --> 00:30:34,142
[laughter, applause]

586
00:30:36,728 --> 00:30:39,773
Then I'd just start saying any word
I've ever heard on <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>

587
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,190
[laughter]

588
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:45,236
"Uh, you, uh, defibrillate
his aortic valve."

589
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,449
Another thing I've learned, being married,

590
00:30:49,574 --> 00:30:53,077
is we're not always gonna see
eye to eye on things, you know?

591
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:54,370
No, we won't.

592
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,165
And like, for instance, okay,

593
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,251
there is a hierarchy
in the Latino culture.

594
00:31:00,335 --> 00:31:02,879
We don't talk about it, but it's there.

595
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,882
There's all kinds
of different Latinos, right?

596
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:08,551
Mexican, Puerto Rican, Salvadorian,

597
00:31:08,677 --> 00:31:10,679
Cuban, Colombian, Dominican,

598
00:31:10,804 --> 00:31:12,597
blah-blah-blah-bian,
bleh-blah-blah-bian,

599
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:15,350
- bleh-bleh-bleh.
- [laughter]

600
00:31:15,433 --> 00:31:17,853
All kinds of us, right?

601
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:19,771
And, like, my husband,
he's Puerto Rican, okay?

602
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:22,649
- Any Puerto Ricans here tonight?
- [light cheering]

603
00:31:22,774 --> 00:31:27,529
Hey. All seven of California's
Puerto Ricans came out tonight.

604
00:31:27,654 --> 00:31:30,156
- [laughter]
- [chuckles]

605
00:31:30,239 --> 00:31:32,034
My husband, he's Puerto Rican, right?

606
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,537
So he thinks Puerto Ricans are at the top
because they have J. Lo.

607
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:38,081
[laughter]

608
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:40,583
All right. We get it.
Team Puerto Rico: one point.

609
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:41,751
[laughter]

610
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:42,961
Well played.

611
00:31:43,086 --> 00:31:45,005
Me, I'm Mexican, okay?

612
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:46,130
Any Mexicans here tonight?

613
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:47,883
[loud cheering]

614
00:31:52,054 --> 00:31:53,805
So, pretty much everybody else.

615
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,391
- [laughter]
- Okay.

616
00:31:56,599 --> 00:31:58,852
I'm Mexican,
so I think Mexicans are at the top

617
00:31:58,977 --> 00:32:01,479
because we have the best food.

618
00:32:01,604 --> 00:32:03,106
[cheers and applause]

619
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:07,402
- These are just facts, you guys.
- [laughter]

620
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:09,362
Google it if you want to.

621
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:13,700
We're not even, like,
the best in the Latino foods.

622
00:32:13,825 --> 00:32:17,787
Like, we jumped into regular
food category. You know what I mean?

623
00:32:17,871 --> 00:32:20,456
Like, ask any of your friends
what their favorite food is,

624
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:22,959
and nine out of ten times they're
gonna go, "Oh, uh, favorite food:

625
00:32:23,043 --> 00:32:25,461
pizza, Chinese and Mexican."

626
00:32:26,504 --> 00:32:27,923
They don't say Latino.

627
00:32:28,006 --> 00:32:29,465

even know the difference between us.

634
00:32:45,523 --> 00:32:48,860
They think all Latinos eat Mexican food.

635
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:55,283
Ask any random white guy, "Hey, name
a Latino dish that is not Mexican."

00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:26,773
I still don't speak Spanish.

648
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:28,316
I know. I wish I did.

649
00:33:28,441 --> 00:33:31,069
Any other Latinos here
that do not speak Spanish?

00:33:31,235 --> 00:33:32,654

A lot of times people just assume

00:36:15,024 --> 00:36:17,277
They'll just start saying
Spanish words at me really fast.

And I don't wanna come out
right away and be like,

"Whoa, whoa, wait.
I don't speak Spanish." Right?

I just give them like

He wouldn't eat his dinner.

He goes, "Yes, I am."

739
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,634
I said, "Elijah, I'm gonna call your mom.

I'm gonna tell her
you're not eating your dinner."

You know what he said to me?
He goes, "Okay.

Can you tell her I'm thirsty, too?"

I'll tell her that, huh?

748

Oh, your mom doesn't do spanks?
Well, she's not here, is she?"

00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,085
Yeah.
And my sister just had a baby last year.

He's so cute, you guys.
Cutest baby in the whole wide world.

I know I'm biased because he's my nephew.

00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:47,676
But then there's actual facts
that you can Google. So...

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,762
- [laughter]
- He's so cute, you guys.

756
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:52,098
He's half Vietnamese, half Mexican.

757
00:38:52,223 --> 00:38:53,641
He's a little Vie-xican.

[laughter]

759
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:57,686
And he has the whitest name ever...

00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,939
Austin Reed Williams.

I know we didn't start off
very Latino with "Johnson," right?

765
00:39:09,282 --> 00:39:10,950
But my brother-in-law, who's Vietnamese,

766
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:13,702
he was adopted by
an all-American white family,

767
00:39:13,786 --> 00:39:15,621
and that's how he got
the last name "Williams."

768
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,333
Like, he was born in Vietnam,
they put him on a plane,

769
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,585
flew him to America, and now he's white.

[laughter]

773
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:32,680
He's the only Vietnamese person I know
that listens to country music,

774
00:39:32,763 --> 00:39:35,683
chews tobacco and goes hunting
on the weekends.

[laughter]

776
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:40,646
He considers his camouflage shirt
to be his "good" shirt.

777
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:45,360
- [laughter]
- Oh, yeah, he has embraced 'Merica.

[laughter]

779
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:51,740
He's Vietnamese, super white,
and he married a Mexican.

780
00:39:51,866 --> 00:39:53,617
He's all kinds of confused.

781
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:55,370
[laughter]

782
00:39:55,578 --> 00:40:00,416
And the crazy thing is, he speaks
better Spanish than my whole family does.

783
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,295
'Cause he works in construction
with real Mexicans.

[laughter]

785
00:40:11,177 --> 00:40:13,137
My family's very Mexican-American, okay?

786
00:40:13,221 --> 00:40:14,638
We speak very little Spanish.

787
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:17,099
My in-laws are super Puerto Rican.

788
00:40:17,183 --> 00:40:19,477
- They speak very little English.
- [laughter]

789
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,521
But they try, okay? They try.

790
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,272
Like, my mother-in-law
will call me sometimes.

791
00:40:23,398 --> 00:40:25,983
She'll leave me a message
on my voice mail like,

792
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:29,945
[Puerto Rican accent] "<i>Hola, mami.</i>
It's your mother-in-law. Eh, call me."

793
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:32,114
[laughter]

794
00:40:37,203 --> 00:40:38,580
So sweet.

795
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,624
They're super Puerto Rican.

796
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,335
Like, they should win
Puerto Rican Of The Year award.

797
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:47,380
- [laughter]
- No, they're really good at it.

798
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:51,175
Like, I don't know how they do it,
but no matter what they're talking about

799
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:55,971
in any conversation,
they can seamlessly bring up Marc Anthony.

800
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,973
[laughter]

801
00:40:59,434 --> 00:41:01,143
You can have a conversation
with my father-in-law.

802
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:05,106
He'll be like, "Hey, the Yankees,
they're gonna be good this year.

803
00:41:05,189 --> 00:41:08,192
But if not, it's okay. Marc Anthony,
he gonna do a special on TV.

804
00:41:08,276 --> 00:41:09,944
- I'll record it for you."
- [laughter]

805
00:41:13,822 --> 00:41:16,284
My mother-in-law
is very traditional, okay?

806
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:20,455
She likes to drink her Pilon coffee,
watch her stories,

807
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,874
make room on the wall for another
Puerto Rican flag somewhere...

808
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:26,001
[laughter]

809
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:28,546
Or coasters,
or a bath mat, or a clock.

810
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:30,548
Puerto Rico everywhere.

811
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,176
And she likes to keep up with us
in our busy lives, right?

812
00:41:34,302 --> 00:41:37,012
So we taught her how to use
Instagram and Facebook.

813
00:41:37,138 --> 00:41:38,973
I'm sorry, "Fay-book," um...

814
00:41:39,098 --> 00:41:41,183
[laughter]

815
00:41:41,267 --> 00:41:44,353
Which is great, 'cause now sometimes I'll
be going through my comments from people.

816
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:47,690
They'll be like, "Hey, love your videos.
When are you coming to Michigan?"

817
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:50,401
"Hey, we were at your show last night.
Had a great time."

818
00:41:50,485 --> 00:41:52,528
- [Puerto Rican accent]<i> "Hola, mami."</i>
<i>- </i>[laughter]

819
00:41:52,612 --> 00:41:54,947
"It's your mother-in-law.

820
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,158
You look too skinny in that picture."

821
00:41:57,366 --> 00:41:59,868
- [laughter]
- "Eh, call me."

822
00:41:59,994 --> 00:42:01,496
[laughter]

823
00:42:03,247 --> 00:42:05,040
So sweet.

824
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:11,130
Now that's she's on social media,
she loves to watch my every move.

825
00:42:12,214 --> 00:42:13,215
Everything I do.

826
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:16,678
Like, remember when everybody was doing
the ALS ice bucket challenge? Right?

827
00:42:16,802 --> 00:42:19,347
Well, I did one too, right?
So I posted it on Instagram.

828
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,140
My mother-in-law calls me the next day.

829
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:25,394
She goes,
"Anjelah, I seen you ice bucket video...

830
00:42:25,478 --> 00:42:27,229
<i>pero </i>I didn't see no ice."

831
00:42:27,355 --> 00:42:28,690
[laughter]

832
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:38,240
But she's really proud of us, too.
Like, she's super proud.

833
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:41,160
Like, anytime we're in a newspaper
or a magazine,

834
00:42:41,243 --> 00:42:46,290
she'll cut it out, put it in a frame,
put it on the wall, right? Super proud.

835
00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:50,419
And recently I noticed that she's started
printing out our Instagram photos.

836
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:52,296
[laughter]

837
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:58,427
So now, if you come over to my
in-laws' house and you look on the wall,

838
00:42:58,553 --> 00:43:00,804
you'll see a family portrait
from the 1980s,

839
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:07,102
a picture from my wedding day,
and my lunch from eight months ago.

840
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:09,230
Hashtag "foodie," hashtag "nomnom."

841
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,402
She's learning.

842
00:43:16,779 --> 00:43:19,156
I'm getting older, you guys.
I'm getting older.

843
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,116
I mean, we all are.
We're all getting older.

844
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:22,951
But it's about me right now.

845
00:43:23,077 --> 00:43:25,371
[laughter]

846
00:43:25,454 --> 00:43:28,457
I'm getting older, but I don't feel it.
I don't feel like I'm getting older,

847
00:43:28,583 --> 00:43:33,045
but I am noticing myself
starting to do older things, okay?

848
00:43:33,128 --> 00:43:35,964
Like, I'm noticing, like, the questions
that I ask nowadays

849
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,342
are like old people questions.

850
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,637
Like, "What time is breakfast?"

851
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,639
[laughter]

852
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,395
- "Do you accept coupons?"
- [laughter]

853
00:43:49,604 --> 00:43:51,355
You know, stuff like that.

854
00:43:52,356 --> 00:43:54,275
And, like,
my friend went to a wedding, right?

855
00:43:54,358 --> 00:43:56,694
And I feel like young people
would ask questions like,

856
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:58,862
"Oh, you went to a wedding? Was it fun?

857
00:43:58,987 --> 00:44:01,073
Was there an open bar?
Did you meet anybody?"

858
00:44:01,282 --> 00:44:02,700
Right? Like, stuff like that.

859
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:05,494
Me, I ask questions like,
"Oh, you went to a wedding?

860
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,830
Did they let you take
the centerpiece home?"

861
00:44:08,038 --> 00:44:10,165
[laughter]

862
00:44:10,249 --> 00:44:13,377
"How about the food?
What kind of food did they serve?

863
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:15,838
Was it, like, buffet-style?

864
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:17,089
It's the best.

865
00:44:17,214 --> 00:44:18,882
How about parking? Was it valet?

866
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:22,136
Self-park? Ugh! Brutal."

867
00:44:22,261 --> 00:44:23,721
[laughter]

868
00:44:26,056 --> 00:44:27,224
I think I'm getting older

869
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:30,436
because I'm starting to give
way too many details to things.

870
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:33,522
Right? Way too many details.
And I see my dad do that.

871
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,190
He gives way too many details to stuff.

872
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:37,401
Like I can ask my dad
a very simple question.

873
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:40,946
"Hey, Dad, are you coming to visit me
this weekend or next weekend?"

874
00:44:41,155 --> 00:44:44,492
His answer should sound something like,
"This weekend."

875
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:48,663
Or "Next weekend."

876
00:44:48,788 --> 00:44:50,748
No, not my dad.

877
00:44:50,956 --> 00:44:53,751
No, you ask my dad that question,
this is the answer you're gonna get:

878
00:44:53,876 --> 00:44:57,588
"Oh, well, hey, I requested time off
from my supervisor.

879
00:44:57,713 --> 00:45:00,549
He trying to tell me that
I didn't request the time off

880
00:45:00,633 --> 00:45:05,346
when I know I did, and then here he goes
giving Diego like two weeks off.

881
00:45:05,429 --> 00:45:07,931
You're not even supposed to have
two weeks at a time, right?

882
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:11,811
So I said, 'Look, I'm gonna
call my union rep, okay?'

883
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:14,563
Sometimes if you just say 'union rep, '
they get all scared.

884
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:16,565
So I said,
'Look, I'm gonna call my union rep.'

885
00:45:16,691 --> 00:45:18,984
And then he goes,
'Fine, you can have your time off.'

886
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:23,405
But he almost didn't give it to me,
but then he did. But he almost didn't."

887
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:25,366
[laughter]

888
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:33,749
- "So... this weekend..."
- [laughter]

889
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,084
"...or next weekend?

890
00:45:36,919 --> 00:45:38,587
Too many details, Dad.

891
00:45:39,672 --> 00:45:42,466
- You're not invited anymore."
- [laughter]

892
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:47,054
I think I'm getting older
'cause I hear people around me

893
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:50,683
say things like, "Turn down for what?"

894
00:45:52,727 --> 00:45:55,855
- And then I tell them what.
- [laughter]

895
00:45:57,231 --> 00:45:59,233
"Turn down for what?"

896
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:01,318
"Uh, it's really loud."

897
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:09,993
"Turn down for what?"

898
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:13,873
- "You have work in the morning."
- [laughter]

899
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:18,920
"Pshh! Turn down for what?"

900
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:22,297
- "You have three kids now!"
- [laughter]

901
00:46:22,381 --> 00:46:24,759
"It is about that time.

902
00:46:24,842 --> 00:46:28,095
- To turn it down."
- [laughter]

903
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:30,848
<i>♪ Pa-pa pom-pom ♪</i>

904
00:46:31,056 --> 00:46:33,100
[laughter, applause]

905
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:39,732
Anybody here ever do jury duty?

906
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:42,693
- [audience cheering]
- Yeah?

907
00:46:42,777 --> 00:46:44,737
I had jury duty not too long ago.

908
00:46:44,862 --> 00:46:50,367
And we were one day into the trial,
and all of a sudden I was released

909
00:46:50,576 --> 00:46:54,413
because apparently I am a terrible juror.

910
00:46:56,791 --> 00:46:58,459
This what happened.

911
00:46:58,542 --> 00:47:00,711
Um, okay, first of all,
I don't know if anybody here

912
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:05,340
has ever been to the movies
with your black friend, okay?

913
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:08,761
And your black friend
likes to talk to the movies

914
00:47:08,844 --> 00:47:11,013
like the actors can hear them.

915
00:47:11,096 --> 00:47:12,848
[laughter]

916
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:15,392
You know what I'm saying?
Like, "Ooh, you better run!"

917
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:18,353
- [laughter]
- "He right behind you!"

918
00:47:19,438 --> 00:47:23,191
- He right behind you!"
- [laughter]

919
00:47:26,862 --> 00:47:29,657
- "He ain't even runnin'."
- [laughter]

920
00:47:30,574 --> 00:47:33,577
It was a similar situation
in the courtroom.

921
00:47:33,661 --> 00:47:35,037
This what happened.

922
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:37,498
The first piece of evidence
they put up on a screen

923
00:47:37,623 --> 00:47:39,667
is a picture of this woman's face

924
00:47:39,792 --> 00:47:42,461
that's just, like, beat-up,
bruised, swollen.

925
00:47:42,544 --> 00:47:44,212
You can't even tell it's a woman, right?

926
00:47:44,379 --> 00:47:49,635
You're supposed to see the picture,
register it, and make a mental note.

927
00:47:49,718 --> 00:47:51,720
Well, I can make a mental note.

928
00:47:53,014 --> 00:47:56,266
I just have a hard time
not saying my mental note.

929
00:47:57,434 --> 00:48:03,440
So the picture comes up on the screen
and my response is: "Ooh, what?"

930
00:48:03,524 --> 00:48:08,403
- [laughter]
- "Oh, hell no!

931
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:14,117
- Da-a-a-ang!"
- [laughter]

932
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:17,496
"That's her face?"

933
00:48:17,579 --> 00:48:18,998
[laughter]

934
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,501
"But that's her face, though?"

935
00:48:22,584 --> 00:48:24,086
[laughter]

936
00:48:25,379 --> 00:48:28,966
"Da-a-a-ang.

937
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,262
Wait, wait, wait. Put it back up."

938
00:48:34,346 --> 00:48:35,973
[laughter]

939
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:38,433
"Lawyer lady,
put it up real quick, please?

940
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:43,397
- Oh, hell no."
- [laughter]

941
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,274
- "Uh-uh. Guilty!"
- [laughter]

942
00:48:47,109 --> 00:48:48,777
- "He did it."
- [cheering]

943
00:48:48,986 --> 00:48:52,155
- "That's him right there."
- [laughter, applause]

944
00:48:56,618 --> 00:48:57,953
They don't like it when you do that.

945
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:03,918
Even the process to get picked
to be on a jury is terrifying, right?

946
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:06,169
And, like,
I speak in front of people for a living.

947
00:49:06,294 --> 00:49:08,422
That's what I do, right?
But all of a sudden,

948
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:12,593
because I'm in a courtroom in front of
maybe 30 people, even I'm nervous, right?

949
00:49:12,718 --> 00:49:14,428
'Cause, like, the judge is talking to me,

950
00:49:14,511 --> 00:49:17,431
and I'm just nervous
'cause a judge is talking to me.

951
00:49:17,514 --> 00:49:19,016
I feel guilty for no reason.

952
00:49:19,182 --> 00:49:20,809
[laughter]

953
00:49:21,769 --> 00:49:24,271
And the judge is asking me questions like,

954
00:49:24,396 --> 00:49:27,983
"Juror number 11, how do you
feel about scientific evidence?"

955
00:49:29,985 --> 00:49:32,446
[laughter]

956
00:49:36,408 --> 00:49:40,871
- "Scientific evidence..."
- [laughter]

957
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:44,291
- "I didn't do very good in school."
- [laughter]

958
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:48,754
- "Uh, she said 'scientific.'"
- [laughter]

959
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:53,592
- "I feel like I should say a big word."
- [laughter]

960
00:49:57,304 --> 00:49:58,722
"Um...

961
00:50:00,724 --> 00:50:04,311
scientific evidence...

962
00:50:04,394 --> 00:50:08,398
is usually presented as factual evidence

963
00:50:08,482 --> 00:50:11,443
in cases where certain circumstances

964
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:16,031
do not provide a level of authenticity

965
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:22,329
that has been derived
through process of elimination,

966
00:50:22,412 --> 00:50:27,542
having been determined
in the petri dish..."

967
00:50:27,626 --> 00:50:29,837
[laughter]

968
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,007
"...to show you

969
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:38,261
that, in fact, it is scientific."

970
00:50:38,386 --> 00:50:40,722
[laughter]

971
00:50:40,848 --> 00:50:42,850
[cheers and applause]

972
00:50:47,021 --> 00:50:48,730
"So...

973
00:50:50,107 --> 00:50:52,067
- yeah."
- [laughter]

974
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:54,319
Then the judge just starts
taking notes, right?

975
00:50:54,444 --> 00:50:56,238
Two attorneys, they start writing notes.

976
00:50:56,363 --> 00:51:00,868
- I'm like, "Uh, did I win that one?"
- [laughter]

977
00:51:01,076 --> 00:51:03,245
Now it's the attorneys' turn.
Now they get to ask me questions.

978
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:08,000
"Juror number 11, earlier you said that
scientific evidence was usually correct.

979
00:51:08,083 --> 00:51:10,169
I think that's what
you were trying to say.

980
00:51:10,293 --> 00:51:14,381
Do you have much experience
with scientific evidence?"

981
00:51:15,674 --> 00:51:17,801
[laughter]

982
00:51:17,885 --> 00:51:20,679
"Um...

983
00:51:20,804 --> 00:51:24,391
other than <i>Law & Order: SVU..."</i>

984
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:26,852
[laughter]

985
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:29,230
"...no, not a whole lot."

986
00:51:29,437 --> 00:51:32,941
Now she has to have a serious conversation
with me about a TV show.

987
00:51:33,025 --> 00:51:37,238
"In these episodes of <i>Law & Order: SVU,</i>
has there ever been a case

988
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,741
where the scientific evidence
was proven incorrect?"

989
00:51:42,325 --> 00:51:44,828
"Um...

990
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:48,999
well, I haven't seen every episode..."

991
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,334
[laughter]

992
00:51:51,418 --> 00:51:52,878
"...but there was this one time

993
00:51:53,003 --> 00:51:54,963
where Jennifer Love Hewitt
was guest-starring.

994
00:51:55,089 --> 00:51:56,965
And she did a good job.
I thought she did real good.

995
00:51:57,091 --> 00:51:59,134
It was like a new role for her.
It was real serious.

996
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,096
She had to cry a lot,
so I thought she did good.

997
00:52:02,221 --> 00:52:04,472
Anyway, there was this guy.
He would follow her to work every day

998
00:52:04,556 --> 00:52:07,184
since she was like 16 years old,
but he would rape her all the time,

999
00:52:07,268 --> 00:52:09,436
like every day, every day,
every day, every day, every day.

1000
00:52:09,644 --> 00:52:11,688
And like, first of all,
I don't know how she didn't see him,

1001
00:52:11,813 --> 00:52:15,442
'cause even I saw him
right at the beginning of the episode.

1002
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,403
I was like,
'Yeah, that's him walking right there.'

1003
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:24,409
But that's 'cause, like, I'm real good
at figuring stuff out like that.

1004
00:52:24,618 --> 00:52:29,206
Typewriter lady, don't forget to put
that I'm real good at figuring stuff out.

1005
00:52:29,331 --> 00:52:32,709
Anyway, they found some DNA evidence,
and they couldn't connect it to him,

1006
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:34,586
so then he got to go home."

1007
00:52:34,711 --> 00:52:39,133
"So do you still feel that
scientific evidence is usually correct?"

1008
00:52:41,218 --> 00:52:45,973
"Ohh. [chuckles]
I see what you did.

1009
00:52:47,474 --> 00:52:50,102
Wait a minute. Have I seen you
on an episode one time?"

1010
00:52:50,185 --> 00:52:51,312
[laughter]

1011
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:53,814
'Cause I do watch <i>Law & Order: SVU</i>
all the time, you guys.

1012
00:52:53,939 --> 00:52:57,318
And it's got me thinking that
not only am I a terrible juror,

1013
00:52:57,442 --> 00:53:01,029
but I'd probably be a terrible
police detective as well.

1014
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:02,823
Because, like, they show
these detectives...

1015
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:04,658
Olivia Benson, right?

1016
00:53:04,741 --> 00:53:07,953
- [cheering]
- Yeah. Detective Stabler,

1017
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:09,997
Detective New Hot Latino Guy.

1018
00:53:10,122 --> 00:53:11,706
[laughter]

1019
00:53:11,832 --> 00:53:14,584
Right? And they show 'em in these
adrenaline-pumping situations, right?

1020
00:53:14,709 --> 00:53:18,046
They're chasing a perp down an alley.
All of a sudden, they trip and fall.

1021
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,299
They just get back up
and start chasing him again.

1022
00:53:22,509 --> 00:53:24,511
Has anybody here ever fallen before?

1023
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:26,347
[laughter]

1024
00:53:27,348 --> 00:53:31,059
- It hurts... you guys.
- [laughter]

1025
00:53:32,144 --> 00:53:36,606
If I trip and fall down, I'm staying down.

1026
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:38,483
[laughter]

1027
00:53:38,566 --> 00:53:40,568
For a while.

1028
00:53:40,694 --> 00:53:42,529
Rubbing my knee.

1029
00:53:42,612 --> 00:53:44,948
[laughter]

1030
00:53:45,032 --> 00:53:47,575
I will be the cop that calls in like...

1031
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:50,078
[imitates radio squelch]
"Officer down!"

1032
00:53:50,162 --> 00:53:53,165
- [laughter]
- "Officer down."

1033
00:53:53,248 --> 00:53:54,624
"Are you shot?"
[radio squelch]

1034
00:53:54,749 --> 00:53:59,171
- "No, but I need some Neosporin!"
- [laughter]

1035
00:53:59,421 --> 00:54:02,799
"Hurry!
[sobbing]

1036
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:05,760
There's little rocks in it!"

1037
00:54:07,304 --> 00:54:09,556
[sobbing]

1038
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:11,225
[laughter]

1039
00:54:17,981 --> 00:54:20,859
To be a good cop, you have to
know your north from your south,

1040
00:54:20,942 --> 00:54:23,278
your east from your west.

1041
00:54:23,362 --> 00:54:26,031
You've seen the episodes, right?

1042
00:54:26,114 --> 00:54:27,032
[radio squelch]

1043
00:54:27,157 --> 00:54:29,243
"Suspect's heading southbound
on First Street."

1044
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:31,912
This would be my call:

1045
00:54:32,037 --> 00:54:34,415
[radio squelch]
"Suspect made a left."

1046
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:36,583
[laughter]

1047
00:54:39,253 --> 00:54:41,338
"Uh, north or south?"
[radio squelch]

1048
00:54:41,546 --> 00:54:43,798
"Definitely not to the right."
[radio squelch]

1049
00:54:43,924 --> 00:54:45,384
[laughter]

1050
00:54:49,888 --> 00:54:51,848
"Uh, in which direction?"
[radio squelch]

1051
00:54:51,973 --> 00:54:54,226
"Towards McDonald's."
[radio squelch]

1052
00:54:59,606 --> 00:55:02,984
They show 'em chasing this perp
into a dark, empty warehouse, right?

1053
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,611
They have their gun out.

1054
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:06,947
All of a sudden,
this guy just pops out of nowhere,

1055
00:55:07,072 --> 00:55:10,242
and their response is: "NYPD! Freeze!"

1056
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:12,494
Where, like, my response would be:

1057
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:14,037
Boom! "Who was that?"

1058
00:55:14,121 --> 00:55:16,206
[laughter]

1059
00:55:23,213 --> 00:55:26,216
- But now he can't tell you who he was.
- [laughter]

1060
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:33,974
I'd probably be
a terrible 9-1-1 dispatcher.

1061
00:55:35,392 --> 00:55:39,771
God forbid you have to call 9-1-1...
and I answer the phone.

1062
00:55:39,854 --> 00:55:41,523
[laughter]

1063
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:44,192
"9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

1064
00:55:44,276 --> 00:55:46,487
There's a guy trying to get in your house?

1065
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:49,990
- Well, did you lock the door?"
- [laughter]

1066
00:55:51,241 --> 00:55:53,660
"You didn't lock the door?

1067
00:55:53,743 --> 00:55:56,579
Well, that was dumb, huh?"

1068
00:55:56,704 --> 00:55:58,290
[laughter]

1069
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:03,504
"I mean, like,
you don't watch movies or..."

1070
00:56:03,586 --> 00:56:04,879
[laughter]

1071
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,924
"No... Yeah, no, I'm sending the cops.

1072
00:56:08,049 --> 00:56:10,469
They are on their way,
but it's gonna be, like, 15 minutes.

1073
00:56:10,552 --> 00:56:12,095
You better find a hiding spot."

1074
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:14,097
[laughter]

1075
00:56:14,181 --> 00:56:17,518
"And don't get under the bed.
They always look there first."

1076
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:19,102
[laughter]

1077
00:56:26,568 --> 00:56:30,322
When I first started doing stand-up,
I got kind of famous on YouTube

1078
00:56:30,447 --> 00:56:32,615
for this joke about getting my nails done.

1079
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:35,035
[cheers and applause]

1080
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:46,588
[chuckles]

1081
00:56:53,261 --> 00:56:54,346
Oh, you've heard it?

1082
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:56,390
[laughter, cheering]

1083
00:56:56,515 --> 00:56:58,266
[chuckles]
It's...

1084
00:56:58,392 --> 00:57:02,229
It's crazy 'cause, like,
when this video first came out,

1085
00:57:02,312 --> 00:57:05,273
I had no idea it was
gonna blow up like that.

1086
00:57:05,357 --> 00:57:07,359
Like, so many people have seen this video

1087
00:57:07,484 --> 00:57:11,446
to the point where now I get scared
when I walk into a nail salon.

1088
00:57:11,572 --> 00:57:13,698
[laughter]

1089
00:57:13,907 --> 00:57:16,034
'Cause, like, I don't
want them to recognize me

1090
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:17,994
and then, like,
cut my finger on purpose.

1091
00:57:18,078 --> 00:57:19,496
[laughter]

1092
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:22,249
But then blame it on me
like it was my fault.

1093
00:57:22,374 --> 00:57:24,334
[Vietnamese accent]
"Honey, relak your hand."

1094
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:27,462
[laughter, cheering]

1095
00:57:38,432 --> 00:57:40,183
[Vietnamese accent]
"You want to wak your eyebrow?"

1096
00:57:40,308 --> 00:57:42,310
[laughter]

1097
00:57:42,394 --> 00:57:44,938
"Uh, no, thank you."

1098
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:46,440
[Vietnamese accent]
"Honey, you need to wak."

1099
00:57:46,607 --> 00:57:48,149
[laughter]

1100
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:52,613
[Vietnamese accent]
"I lie your eye sadow. It look nice.

1101
00:57:52,695 --> 00:57:54,948
Your eye sadow. Look down. Look down."

1102
00:57:55,031 --> 00:57:56,908
[laughter]

1103
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,453
- "I lie the sadow."
- [laughter]

1104
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:07,502
Now sometimes the girls that are getting
their nails done, they recognize me.

1105
00:58:07,669 --> 00:58:10,547
Like, "Hey, you're the girl
that does the nail salon..."

1106
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:11,923
[hushed]
"Mm, no!"

1107
00:58:12,006 --> 00:58:14,342
[laughter]

1108
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:15,636
"What, are you crazy?"

1109
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:17,762
[laughter]

1110
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:20,307
Right? 'Cause, like, one time
I was getting my pedicure done,

1111
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:22,684
and the lady that was doing
my pedicure, she said to me:

1112
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:24,519
[Vietnamese accent]
"What your name?"

1113
00:58:24,603 --> 00:58:26,104
[laughter]

1114
00:58:31,526 --> 00:58:35,530
And it wasn't like
your typical friendly greeting, like:

1115
00:58:35,614 --> 00:58:38,866
[Vietnamese accent]
"Hi, honey. How you do?

1116
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,286
How you mom?"

1117
00:58:41,411 --> 00:58:44,205
- It was different.
- [laughter]

1118
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:46,500
It was very like:

1119
00:58:46,583 --> 00:58:49,085
- [Vietnamese accent] "What your name?"
- [laughter]

1120
00:58:54,257 --> 00:58:57,594
I said, "Anjelah." And she goes,
"That what I thought."

1121
00:58:57,678 --> 00:58:59,887
[laughter]

1122
00:59:00,013 --> 00:59:03,099
"Oh, shoot.

1123
00:59:03,224 --> 00:59:05,226
Vietnamese people have YouTube."

1124
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:09,147
I started getting all nervous.

1125
00:59:09,356 --> 00:59:11,316
She could tell I was getting
a little uncomfortable,

1126
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:14,110
so she goes,
"Don't worry, I don't tell nobody."

1127
00:59:14,194 --> 00:59:16,946
- [laughter]
- "Oh, thank you."

1128
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,115
[chuckles]
Besties!

1129
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,659
[laughter]

1130
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:24,954
People always ask me, like,
"How'd you learn to do that accent?

1131
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:26,956
Who taught you how to do that?"
Right?

1132
00:59:27,123 --> 00:59:30,251
Well, I grew up in a place
called San Jose, California.

1133
00:59:30,377 --> 00:59:32,462
[cheers and applause]

1134
00:59:32,546 --> 00:59:34,797
It's the Bay Area's Westminster, okay?

1135
00:59:34,922 --> 00:59:36,841
[laughter]

1136
00:59:36,924 --> 00:59:39,302
So I grew up eating pho.
Do you guys eat pho?

1137
00:59:39,427 --> 00:59:40,762
[audience cheering]

1138
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:43,014
Right? So I grew up eating pho.

1139
00:59:43,139 --> 00:59:46,976
And I would put all kind of chili sauce
in my pho...

1140
00:59:47,977 --> 00:59:50,813
- 'cause I'm Mexican.
- [laughter]

1141
00:59:50,897 --> 00:59:52,482
So I put all kind of chili sauce
in my pho,

1142
00:59:52,649 --> 00:59:55,151
and the lady that worked there,
she would get mad at me

1143
00:59:55,276 --> 00:59:58,821
'cause she thought I was just
playing around and wasting all her sauce.

1144
00:59:58,946 --> 01:00:00,574
So she would yell at me.
She'd be like:

1145
01:00:00,782 --> 01:00:03,243
[Vietnamese accent]
"Don't put the too mut the sah!"

1146
01:00:03,326 --> 01:00:05,412
[laughter]

1147
01:00:11,752 --> 01:00:15,672
"If you put the too mut the sah,
you met the whole thing up."

1148
01:00:15,797 --> 01:00:17,257
[laughter]

1149
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:22,053
"If you do the sah, you do the one tam."

1150
01:00:22,136 --> 01:00:24,598
[laughter]

1151
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:26,433
"You do sah, no sah."

1152
01:00:26,516 --> 01:00:28,142
[laughter]

1153
01:00:28,226 --> 01:00:29,644
"Sah, no sah."

1154
01:00:29,728 --> 01:00:31,813
[laughter]

1155
01:00:31,896 --> 01:00:34,357
"Mah-mah say, mah-mah sah,
mah sah, no sah."

1156
01:00:34,482 --> 01:00:36,317
[laughter]

1157
01:00:36,401 --> 01:00:38,986
[cheering]

1158
01:00:43,157 --> 01:00:46,994
"If you met the whole thing up,
you don't get to take back."

1159
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:48,413
[laughter]

1160
01:00:48,538 --> 01:00:52,584
- [speaking mock Vietnamese]
- [laughter]

1161
01:00:54,961 --> 01:00:56,755
[continues speaking mock Vietnamese]

1162
01:00:56,838 --> 01:00:58,465
[laughter]

1163
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,601
"She don't get to take back!"

1164
01:01:09,726 --> 01:01:11,144
[cheers and applause]

1165
01:01:21,446 --> 01:01:25,116
And when that joke first came out,
a lot of people loved it, right?

1166
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,788
But some people hated it... and I started
getting hate mail from people.

1167
01:01:29,871 --> 01:01:30,705
[audience members]
Aww.

1168
01:01:30,831 --> 01:01:33,291
Yeah. Like, I would get a letter.

1169
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,002
And you could tell it was
written by a Vietnamese person.

1170
01:01:36,085 --> 01:01:38,129
[laughter]

1171
01:01:38,212 --> 01:01:40,173
'Cause, like, I would read
a letter and it'd be like...

1172
01:01:40,298 --> 01:01:42,676
[Vietnamese accent]
"If I see you in the street..."

1173
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:45,595
[laughter]

1174
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:47,555
"...you don't want that to happen."

1175
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:49,140
[laughter]

1176
01:01:56,356 --> 01:01:59,317
- Oohhh!
- [laughter]

1177
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,945
Then it started getting real crazy, right?
I started getting death threats.

1178
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:04,823
One time after a show,
this Vietnamese guy,

1179
01:02:04,947 --> 01:02:08,869
he was so mad at me,
he yelled at me, he cussed at me.

1180
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:10,704
But he didn't cuss correctly.

1181
01:02:10,829 --> 01:02:12,455
[laughter]

1182
01:02:12,539 --> 01:02:14,875
He come up to me real mad.

1183
01:02:14,957 --> 01:02:17,043
[Vietnamese accent]
"What the fut?"

1184
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:18,670
[laughter]

1185
01:02:21,882 --> 01:02:23,383
Real mad. F-U-T.

01:02:23,508 --> 01:02:25,468
[laughter]

1187
01:02:25,635 --> 01:02:27,804
"What the fut?"

1188
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:29,890
[laughter]

1189
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,519
I was like, "Mm, sir,
I don't even know if that counts."

1190
01:02:34,602 --> 01:02:36,563
- [laughter]
- I'm Anjelah Johnson.

1191
01:02:36,646 --> 01:02:39,065
Thank you guys so much
