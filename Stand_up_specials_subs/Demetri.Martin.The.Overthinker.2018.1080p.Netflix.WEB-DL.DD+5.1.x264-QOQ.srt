1
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,303
Man, that was a good improv.
I'm so glad I asked for notes.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,976
I think my favorite animal to look at
is probably the squirrel.

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,894
Yeah!

4
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,648
You know what I mean? 'Cause any squirrel,
if you watch 'em long enough,

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,151
there's a moment where they suddenly
realize they're late for something.

6
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,279
"Shit! I gotta go. Excuse me. What?"

7
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,160
That's a whole species
that's behind schedule.

8
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:38,330
They're terrible
at keeping their calendar.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,917
Probably the most flammable of the small
animals would be the squirrel as well.

10
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,503
The tail. I mean, it's a...

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,297
<i>All right, that worked pretty well.</i>

12
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,633
<i>It's a good room.</i>

13
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,385
<i>Got my water.</i>

14
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,637
<i>Mic stand feels good.</i>

15
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,097
<i>Solid.</i>

16
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,976
<i>Looks like I've got enough fake fog.
That's important.</i>

17
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,479
<i>Maybe show my name.
Okay.</i>

18
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,398
<i>Anything else?</i>

19
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,066
<i>Title?</i>

20
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,277
<i>Yeah.</i>

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,029
<i>All right. This should be fun.</i>

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,490
<i>What was I gonna say?</i>

23
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:15,117
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

24
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:18,537
I've noticed that you can carry around
a plastic bag with shit in it.

25
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:19,871
Um...

26
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,874
if you're near a dog,
you can have a bag of shit.

27
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,797
As long as you're with a dog, it's like,
"He's got a bag of shit." That's fine.

28
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,052
If you don't have a dog,
then we have a problem. You can't just...

29
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,890
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa.

30
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,686
You gotta be holding that for a friend.
You can't just have shit.

31
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,941
How weird is that
from the dog's perspective? I mean...

32
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,694
Pick it up and collect it.
You know what I mean?

33
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,989
They must be kind of just like, "No!

34
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,826
Leave that. You don't want that. Just...

35
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:05,167
What is he doing? This fucking psycho
is collecting my shit."

36
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,133
We probably seem the craziest
of all the animals.

37
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,677
From their perspective,
when they look at our behavior.

38
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:16,928
You know what I mean? 'Cause...

39
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,181
If we show up places we don't belong...

40
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,059
I don't feel like any other animal
really does that,

41
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,519
but we do that, you know?
Like scuba diving.

42
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:30,692
I'm sure fish swim by and they're like,
"What the fuck are you doing here?

43
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,363
Look at yourself." And we're like...

44
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:41,036
"Those are not your feet.
Get the hell out of here. Come on.

45
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:45,290
You've got all the land. Really?
I mean..."

46
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,505
Skydiving. I'm sure birds are like,
"That one's gonna die. Did you see that?"

47
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,216
"Wow. That was dumb."

48
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,222
I mean, bird watching, that's gotta
be creepy for birds. I mean...

49
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,142
What are we doing?
These birds are hanging out.

50
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,229
We ignore them most of the time.
Suddenly some fat couple from Ohio

51
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,647
is just obsessed with a bird.

52
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,607
The bird's like...

53
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,691
"What?

54
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,027
Me?

55
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,988
Are you happy? Piss off. What do you want?

56
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,785
Should I shit on him?"
"Yeah. If you have some, get over there."

57
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:29,543
I wouldn't be surprised if the birdbath
was invented by some sort of bird pervert.

58
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,502
I mean...

59
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,297
Some guy's in his kitchen
looking out there,

60
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,550
"Oh, yeah, splash around in there, birds.

61
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,388
That's it. Some naked birds
bathing together for my entertainment.

62
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,056
That's it. Oh, yeah.

63
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,100
Wash up, bird."

64
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,439
It's just disgusting, man.
It's like an open-top Turkish bath.

65
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,774
I mean, there's no privacy for the birds.

66
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,570
Some people own birds. That's...

67
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,447
That's a power move, I'll tell you that.

68
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:03,702
You know what I mean, like,
"Hey, there's something that can fly.

69
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,203
I'm gonna change that.

70
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,417
I think I'll put that in my kitchen,
yeah."

71
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,337
Just like low-grade villain behavior.

72
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,925
"My own personal prisoner in my kitchen
in a cage. There we go."

73
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,972
I think my favorite holiday is Halloween.

74
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,640
It's my favorite, yeah.

75
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,268
That's a good holiday

76
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,021
because you don't
have to celebrate that with your family.

77
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,109
You never hear,
"What are you doing for Halloween?"

78
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,154
"I gotta fly back East
and go trick-or-treating with my parents."

79
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,158
"That sucks." "They got a divorce.

80
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,368
I gotta bring two different costumes
this year."

81
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,458
I like reading. I'm a big reader. I, uh...

82
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,002
I feel like I just end up reading
everything. I don't know.

83
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,671
Like the other day, I was in my kitchen,

84
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:59,299
I opened a drawer
and I pulled out the Reynolds Wrap,

85
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,468
and ended up reading the box
of Reynolds Wrap.

86
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,763
It said, "Reynolds Wrap,
trusted since 1947."

87
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,557
I thought,
"Oh, that's interesting. Trusted.

88
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,101
What an interesting word to use that is."

89
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,523
It implies some sort of dark past
for Reynolds.

90
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,153
"Trusted since '47. Founded in '37."

91
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,701
First ten years, some shady shit
going on with Reynolds.

92
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,412
You couldn't trust them, I guess.

93
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,540
"Did you get tinfoil?"
"Yeah." "Open the box."

94
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,750
"Shit. There's just pebbles in here.
This is..."

95
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,294
"Foiled!"

96
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,258
A-ha!

97
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,764
I read everything.
I was reading a beach ball last summer

98
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,224
at a pool party.

99
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,643
I guess I was having a great time
at the party and...

100
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,771
I'm sitting there, reading a beach ball.

101
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,900
It says on the ball, "Warning:
This is not a life-saving device."

102
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:02,028
I'm like, "Okay,
there's definitely a story here."

103
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,700
Some guy's drowning, "Get the beach ball!"

104
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,702
Just pelt the guy with the beach ball.

105
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,665
"I appreciate the effort, I'm having fun,
but I'm dying here, you see?

106
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:17,961
I need the donut of this.
This is the donut hole of what I need.

107
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,257
I need the donut,
so I can live, okay? Thank you."

108
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,303
Donut hole
is the most disgusting-sounding thing

109
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,596
that tastes the best to me.

110
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,684
I put a ladyfinger in a donut hole
and it's totally fine.

111
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,648
Donut hole is interesting

112
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:42,402
'cause it's the thing we call
as a donut hole

113
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,029
that we took out of the donut.

114
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,242
And then the hole itself that was left,

115
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,121
the absence of a donut hole
is the donut hole.

116
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:59,377
So it's kind of a paradox. It's like it is
and not is at the same time.

117
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,714
That's impossible, the donut hole.
It's kind of...

118
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,469
I like cupcakes. That's a great dessert.

119
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,347
Kind of awkward to eat a cupcake, though.
Know what I mean?

120
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,850
One of the only desserts you have to peel
the underwear off if you want to eat it.

121
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:14,768
You have to...

122
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:19,981
undress the cupcake,
and it's kind of a swamp-ass under there.

123
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:23,485
"Am I gonna eat
this sweaty-ass dessert here?

124
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,402
Is this for me?

125
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:29,866
Yes, I am.
I'm gonna eat this swamp-ass pastry."

126
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,369
<i>I'm gonna have a cupcake after the show.</i>

127
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,120
<i>Definitely.</i>

128
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,831
I have a book idea.
I wanna write an autobiography

129
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,249
that turns into a biography.

130
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,543
I've never seen a book
like that before, so...

131
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:44,089
Yeah, so the first three or four chapters
would be about, like, my childhood.

132
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,967
And then, like, in chapter four,

133
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,761
I would just casually mention
Benjamin Franklin.

134
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,265
I'd say something like,
"Speaking of Franklin..."

135
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,810
Then the whole rest of the book
is about Benjamin Franklin's life.

136
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,942
You get to the end and you're like,
"That freaking nerd

137
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:06,319
tricked me into learning
about Benjamin Franklin.

138
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:09,781
Damn it."

139
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,536
When people don't sleep well,
they say they tossed and turned.

140
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,330
And, um, I've definitely had rough nights
where I...

141
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,290
I turn a lot in my sleep,
know what I mean?

142
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:22,335
But I've never slept so poorly
that I ended up like,

143
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,672
lightly throwing things around the room.

144
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,386
It's 4:00 in the morning, and I'm like,
"Oh, shit. I'm tossing. Stop it.

145
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,640
The hell am I doing? Go to sleep, man.
Stop it. You're tossing. Stop it."

146
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,352
You wake up the next day
and there's crap everywhere.

147
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,397
I'm like, "Oh, my God.
I slept very poorly.

148
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,026
And why do I own so many beanbags?

149
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,361
This is making it worse."

150
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,992
I was driving when I saw a guy,
he was driving a convertible

151
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,994
and he was wearing a hoodie.

152
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,247
It's like, wow,
this guy loves convertibles.

153
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,207
He's got two of them on.

154
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,465
He's got a little personal convertible
inside the big one.

155
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:15,722
I think it'd be cool when you have a baby
to put the baby's bottle in a paper bag,

156
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,057
like a discreet little...

157
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,812
paper bag, you know.
Babies just drinking all the time anyway.

158
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,982
Plus when they try to walk,
they look kind of like...

159
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,116
The baby has a dirty suit on,
which I didn't mention,

160
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,994
so it's kind of like a little wino
with a little bit of scruff.

161
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,665
I was thinking recently that "rapper"

162
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,169
is kind of a weird job title for someone,

163
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,047
to call them a rapper.
You know what I mean? Using that word.

164
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,965
'Cause it sounds like a word
we already have

165
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,093
like a, you know, candy wrapper
or something.

166
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,012
I know it's spelled differently
but, you know, sounds the same.

167
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,890
Then I realized,
well, the alternative is "rappist."

168
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,767
So...

169
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,895
Yeah, I think "rapper"
was the right choice.

170
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,821
The other day I was thinking,

171
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:15,490
it's where I was thinking,
I tend to overthink things.

172
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,285
And then I thought,
"Do I, though? I mean..."

173
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,332
<i>Maybe I do. I don't know.</i>

174
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,795
<i>It's hard to say how much thinking
counts as overthinking.</i>

175
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,798
<i>What's the threshold?</i>

176
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,968
<i>You never really get a sense of
how much any one person thinks.</i>

177
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,094
<i>But...</i>

178
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:41,015
<i>Yeah, I guess right now
I'm technically overthinking.</i>

179
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,767
<i>Seems appropriate because...</i>

180
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,856
<i>You know, this is the middle of a joke
about overthinking.</i>

181
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:48,815
<i>So...</i>

182
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,569
But I think back to my own childhood
and I can think of times

183
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,029
when I was trying to almost,
like, figure things out.

184
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,574
You know what I mean?
Trying to, like, strategize.

185
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,577
I don't have a lot of memories like that
but I can remember certain times as a kid.

186
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,787
Like, I was at a birthday party

187
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,790
and it came the time for the kid
to blow out his candles.

188
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,460
I would sneak in my own wish.

189
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,214
Right at that moment
when he blew out the candles.

190
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:16,801
I... you know, I was thinking,
I don't know if there's a wishing radius

191
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,803
or portal or something, you know...

192
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,763
Some sort of, like, a magical moment.

193
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,390
Anybody can make a wish, actually.

194
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,101
Once those candles are blown out,
like, that's your chance.

195
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,520
It's people are just not taking
advantage of it.

196
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:28,980
"Oh, yeah, maybe me, too."

197
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,941
Some kid would blow out his candles,
I'd be like, "Me too."

198
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,109
I don't know what I was thinking

199
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,737
like there's some sort
of Wish Fulfilment Bureau.

200
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,822
They're like,
"We got another birthday wish here."

201
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:40,408
"Oh, yeah? Actually two came in."
"Oh, twins?"

202
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,786
"No. Just some other kid decided
to piggyback, it was open."

203
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,624
"Well, how close to the cake
is he standing?"

204
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,250
"Five feet."

205
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,628
"That's good. He's in the circle."

206
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:56,674
"Give him his wish. He beat the system."
And I'm like, "Yes!"

207
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,847
<i>All right. What's next?
Maybe I'll do the drawings now. Yeah.</i>

208
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,934
<i>Okay.</i>

209
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,770
These are some drawings.

210
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,319
I wanna start with the design
I'm working on.

211
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:20,406
T-shirts are pretty popular
for a long time, um...

212
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,784
This is a P-shirt,
so it's based on a letter P,

213
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,704
rather than the T.
Sleeveless on this side and this...

214
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,166
sleeve is attached.
So, if you're impatient,

215
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,168
it's a good shirt,
like, "Can we go? Come on."

216
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,214
The P-shirt.

217
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,095
You know, sometimes
I get a feeling about a letter.

218
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,763
And they just don't hit me right.

219
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,975
I don't know what it is.
Like M always felt a little weird to me,

220
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,560
and I just recently figured out
what it is.

221
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,521
I think M is very aggressive.

222
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,819
Spread-eagle, you know?

223
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,488
The W is even worse.

224
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,452
Very bony-ass face-plant.

225
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,873
Probably the worst would be the A.

226
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,713
It's the A-hole as you can see in here.

227
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,092
Very flirtatious, this guy.

228
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,934
The dollar sign doesn't look like
the symbol for money to me.

229
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,060
This doesn't look like money.

230
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,396
This looks like the perfect symbol
for shish kebab.

231
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,651
- I love Christmas cookies.
- Yeah!

232
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,737
Yeah, I love the sugar cookies

233
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,739
with the different color icing
and everything.

234
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,116
It's exciting every time
Christmas comes around,

235
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,452
you get to have these cookies
and they're in all the stores.

236
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,912
It is frustrating though.
Because then, Christmas season ends

237
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,582
and, you know, they vanish,
you can't have them anymore.

238
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,917
But, I think we could have these
cookies year-round

239
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,171
if we just, kind of reframe the cookies
a little bit, you know.

240
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,841
Even in the summer time, you'll be like,
"Hey, I got some pine tree cookies here.

241
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,136
If anybody wants
a, you know, forest-based cookie,

242
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,139
it's just a pine tree
or a non-denominational star

243
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,016
if anyone's interested in a star cookie.

244
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,020
Could I have another girl
with a fucked-up back cookie? Those are...

245
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,607
The saggy hunchbacks are delicious.

246
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,944
Do you have any more of those
fat, hipster burglar cookies?

247
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,747
If you're trying to learn
how to read music, you might know this.

248
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,043
There are mnemonic devices
to learn where the notes are,

249
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,337
kind of on the clef here, so, uh...

250
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,633
You know, "Every Good Boy Does Fine"
is something they tell you.

251
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:47,303
I think we can do better. I think there
are other ways to remember this.

252
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,889
More memorable ways.

253
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:53,726
Maybe, "Elephants Go Bald Daily. Fuck."

254
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,523
"Eating Gas? Bad Diarrhea Farts."

255
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,278
"Entire Generation Blows.
Damn it, Facebook."

256
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,831
Or tell them just to spell the word "egg"
but don't finish.

257
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,083
"E, G, But Don't Finish."

258
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,838
Smart.

259
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,384
This is a magician's "to do" list.

260
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:27,802
Uh...

261
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,638
it's pretty simple. To Do. Ta Da.
Okay, done.

262
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,895
It's cool when you see a magician
pull a rabbit out of a hat. That's cool.

263
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,482
What would even be cooler would be
to see him pull a hat out of a rabbit.

264
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,908
And then a rabbit out of that hat.
There we go.

265
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:54,370
Ass rabbit.

266
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,335
It's a classic a balloon. "It's a boy."

267
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:05,089
If somebody has a boy.
That's a... That's a classic.

268
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,217
We live in different times now.
We're in much more gender fluid times.

269
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,428
You don't wanna assume anything.

270
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,723
I think what might be safer now would be,
"It's alive!"

271
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,604
We'll see how the child does.
You know what I mean?

272
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,483
Instead of "Get well soon."
Maybe "Stay alive!" I think that's...

273
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,360
That's a good balloon there.

274
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,822
I tell you what doesn't work is,
"Stay a boy!"

275
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,576
You can't do that.

276
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,413
This is my favorite abbreviation

277
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,749
of all abbreviations
that people have come up with.

278
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:44,754
"TBD," because this meant what it means

279
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:50,468
before... it meant what it means.

280
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,680
It was always TBD before...
You know what I mean? So...

281
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,351
Now here's a graph.

282
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,853
This is how that joke just did.
You see? That's...

283
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,358
This is what I expected. This is the...

284
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,654
So we have a problem.
There's a differential here.

285
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,240
This is where I live.
It's like right in here.

286
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,159
It's pretty much my life. Okay.

287
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,203
Okay.

288
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,289
Now, laughing and peeing
have a pretty interesting relationship,

289
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,457
I think, this is a...

290
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,212
Kind of group dynamics, really.
You know what I mean?

291
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,675
If you laugh in a group, that's okay.
Yeah, that's great.

292
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,720
If you laugh alone, crazy.
I think that's pretty crazy.

293
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,474
If I see somebody just laughing, you know,
on his own, on the street,

294
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,476
"This guy's gonna kill me."
You can't just...

295
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,812
You're not allowed to just laugh.

296
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,690
Peeing is kind of the opposite.

297
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:50,611
So if you... pee alone, that's okay.
I think that's really how it's intended.

298
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,865
That's a private thing, really,
It's your own peeing time, um...

299
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,161
Peeing in a group, that's crazy.
I think, if you need,

300
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,372
you know, a bunch of people,

301
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,250
"We're all here? I can pee now.
Thank you. Let's just do this."

302
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,504
If you laugh so hard that it makes you pee

303
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,548
in a group...

304
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,218
that's great. That's okay.
You're having a great time.

305
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:19,181
If you laugh so hard
that it makes pee alone,

306
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,268
definitely a lunatic.
I can't think of anybody...

307
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,563
Anything that funny that you can't
control yourself when you're alone,

308
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,481
and actually pee on yourself, this is...

309
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,569
If you pee and then laugh,

310
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,574
alone, crazy, I think.

311
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,327
"Asparagus!"

312
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,956
It's not funny like that, really, I think.

313
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,086
Pee and then laugh in a group,
that's the craziest. That's...

314
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,632
That's a cult.
We're just peeing on a corpse.

315
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,675
"We did it!"

316
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,970
Complicated. Okay.

317
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,266
This is a good sign, I think,
for a strip club during the daytime.

318
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,186
"Sorry we're clothed."

319
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,147
<i>I wonder what the drawings look
like from the balcony.</i>

320
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,149
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

321
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,319
Here we have an "Out of Order" sign
that's out of order, so...

322
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,201
That doesn't work, you see.
Which makes it work.

323
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,789
This is just me saying this.

324
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,422
Here we have a graph. Parties.

325
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,634
This is... how fun the party is
based on the type of party.

326
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,010
Toga party, very fun.

327
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,596
Birthday party, also fun.
A house party, fun.

328
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,724
Big drop-off for search party. So...

329
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,396
Much less fun, traditionally,
a search party.

330
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,524
"So we're looking for a body. Okay."

331
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:57,363
That's... more of a get-together
at best, I'd say, than a party per se.

332
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,033
Toga search party is a little bit more fun
than the standard search party.

333
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,037
We got a theme here, "Hey,
we're Romans and this guy's missing."

334
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,084
Here's a Venn diagram. This is a...

335
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,254
Vacation activities. Enemas.

336
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,423
Water skiing. That's where they overlap.

337
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:25,141
Here's another Venn diagram.
This is... tough guys and spandex.

338
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,852
And the football is where they...

339
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,522
overlap right there.

340
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,238
Finally, praying. We have a graph here.

341
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:42,324
This is the amount people pray
based on the location that they're in.

342
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,535
In the locker room
before championship games,

343
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,204
there's a lot of prayer going on.
And church, even more.

344
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,457
Kneeling in front of the toilet
is off the charts.

345
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,752
This is where people really...
talk to God, usually.

346
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,171
A lot of promises
are made just right there.

347
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,882
In a Jacuzzi, very little.

348
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:03,220
Not much prayer goes on
in a... Jacuzzi situation.

349
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,850
And things that pray. People and mantises.

350
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,189
It's a tie.

351
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,942
It's the end of the drawings.

352
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,110
All right.

353
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,405
<i>You know what?
I wanna try something.</i>

354
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,534
<i>Okay.</i>

355
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,456
<i>That was kinda cool.</i>

356
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,126
<i>What was my next bit? Oh, yeah.</i>

357
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,004
I find that my horoscope
is a lot more accurate

358
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,216
if I just live, like, less specifically.

359
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,137
I just live kind of a vague life.

360
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,265
It's kinda like spot-on, you know.

361
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,186
"What are you doing tomorrow?"
"Making some choices."

362
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,777
"You're such a Gemini."
"You know it, man. That's me."

363
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:05,783
Why do we have half sizes for shoes?
That's kinda weird.

364
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,202
We could have picked twice as many numbers

365
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,413
and then we wouldn't have had
to have fractions

366
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,499
in the shoe sizes, you know what I mean?

367
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,210
It seems like a mistake.
Maybe they picked the shoe sizes

368
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,296
and then people's feet got more specific
somehow or something.

369
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,299
"We're all done with the shoe sizes."

370
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,885
"Excuse me,
I don't fit in the nine or the ten."

371
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,471
"You gotta be fucking kidding me."

372
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,602
"We just officialised all the numbers.
Where were you?"

373
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,399
"Shit. We're going to fractions.
This is unbelievable. I can't..."

374
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,904
I think it's cool that we have dashes
in phone numbers.

375
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,823
That was a good idea. That's a good move.

376
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,119
It'd be hard to get someone's number
without those little dashes in there.

377
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:51,453
"What's your number?
I'll give you a call."

378
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,707
"Oh, sure. It's 3,256,568..."

379
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,917
"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jesus Christ, man!

380
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,755
Your number's huge.
This is crazy. Just forget it.

381
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,675
I can't count that high to call you."

382
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:14,602
It's kind of cool that O and zero
work so nicely together.

383
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,354
I feel like O
will just substitute for zero.

384
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,190
Like, all the time
and nobody has a problem with it.

385
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,442
'Cause they look so alike.

386
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,737
You know, somebody gets your number,
260-4050, whatever, you know.

387
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,325
But you can't substitute "0" for "O."

388
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,535
It doesn't go the other way
for some reason.

389
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,496
"Spell you first name for me."
"T-H-0-M-A-S."

390
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,084
"The fuck, are you a robot?
You can't have a zero on your name."

391
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,049
It's kind of a one-way street, really,
with the...

392
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:51,347
I think it's weird that they went
to double digits so quickly with numbers.

393
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,892
I mean, we literally have
an infinite number of numbers.

394
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,393
There's so many numbers.

395
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,520
But when they were coming up
with the shapes,

396
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,940
it was like somebody uncreative
was working on the shapes or something

397
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:06,445
'cause they just... they just ran out
of ideas quickly. You know what I mean?

398
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:11,200
Even at nine, you could tell they were
in trouble. They were like, uh...

399
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,286
"Maybe just flip the six? I don't know."

400
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,373
"I'm done, man. I'm out.

401
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,167
Just double them up from here
or something.

402
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,586
I don't know. That's all I have. Okay?"

403
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,299
I like sports bars.

404
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,343
Sports bars are great.

405
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,720
They collect all the people
I don't wanna hang out with

406
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,180
and they put them in one room.

407
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:39,853
Yeah.

408
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,439
I'm not against sports.
I don't have a problem with sports.

409
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:45,442
I'm just not good at it.
I'm not coordinated.

410
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,902
I'm not drawn to sports.

411
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,780
I don't even look like someone
who could spend time on a sports bar.

412
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,409
I have a very punchable face
in a sports bar.

413
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,744
It's not a good look. You know?

414
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,747
This is not a sports nose.
You know, I know what I look like.

415
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:03,544
Maybe for swimming this is a good nose.

416
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:08,632
If I just keep my face down in the water.
Kind of a rudder, I can steady my head.

417
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,386
It's not an athletic look I have.

418
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,348
I just learned recently
that your nose and your ears

419
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,643
are the only parts of your body
that keep growing through your adult life.

420
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,688
And I was like,
"You gotta be fucking kidding me."

421
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,317
Really? Okay.

422
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,071
If I live long enough, this is gonna be
a shit show, man. This is...

423
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,909
"Here comes Grandpa.
He's got that little walker for his nose,

424
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,203
just couple of wheels
on the front of this thing."

425
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,748
Roll it in.

426
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,921
They should have a stationary bike
at the gym that's in a wheelie position.

427
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:51,467
It'll be kinda cool.

428
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,636
I'm like, "Yeah, I'll ride a wheelie
for a half an hour. Shit, yeah."

429
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,388
I'll get on that thing. Hello.

430
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,227
Or a Stairmaster that goes downstairs.
Just one of them would be like,

431
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,062
"I'm not pushing it today.

432
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,482
I'm just gonna go down,
like, six flights of stairs."

433
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:16,408
I'm not a big workout guy.
I've gone to gyms, but it doesn't...

434
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,993
doesn't take for me, you know.

435
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,412
The gym is too intense.

436
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:24,333
You ever make eye contact with somebody
in the mirror at the gym?

437
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,543
It's like way too intimate.

438
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:30,297
That one bounce
just makes it very personal.

439
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,300
It doesn't help if you try to diffuse it

440
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,385
by like, you know, encouraging the guy.

441
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,805
He's like, "Hey, good job."
"What the fuck, man!"

442
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:42,976
Uh...

443
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,104
I have tried to work out, though,
over the years. I have...

444
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:47,356
I put some effort into it.

445
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,943
I'm the kind of person
where I can make a really good plan.

446
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,529
You know, I really do like charts
and graphs and stuff.

447
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,949
So make like a big poster
by hand, I write it out.

448
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,410
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
You know, chest and triceps.

449
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,496
Tuesday, Thursday, back and biceps.

450
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,705
And I got abs on this day

451
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,917
and a whole program
I've worked out for myself.

452
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,335
Done research and everything.

453
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,213
I post it up on a cork board
at my house and...

454
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,633
Nice start.
I come out of the gate pretty good.

455
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,261
I can do like three days, five days,
maybe a week.

456
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,222
I don't think I ever made it to two weeks
but I give it a shot.

457
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,767
Then I lose steam, you know.
It just doesn't happen for me

458
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,936
and I get distracted, I do something else.

459
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,940
Um, what's weird is I'm old enough now
that I've repeated this pattern.

460
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:34,528
I can see my behavior,
like, this pattern repeating itself.

461
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,405
Because I take "before" photos, too.

462
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,448
I take... I get in the living room,

463
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,410
you know, underwear, shorts,
no shirt, just kinda...

464
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,165
You don't smile on the "before" photos.
I kinda have this blank...

465
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,628
And then after you work out,
you're supposed to be like, "Hey!"

466
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,882
You've got a tan. You're lathered up
or whatever a few months later.

467
00:27:54,965 --> 00:27:57,467
I just never made it that far,
it just never worked out.

468
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,554
So, I just had a series
of photos of myself...

469
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,016
getting older in my underwear. That's it.

470
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:10,522
If somebody found the photos after I died,
"What was this guy's fetish?

471
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,440
What is this?

472
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,611
Just aging sadly in his living room?
What the...?"

473
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,116
Sometimes on the news
I've noticed that reporters

474
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,743
are kind of shitty to each other.

475
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,414
Sometimes a reporter will introduce
another reporter who's out in the field

476
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,751
and just give away their whole story
in their introduction.

477
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:33,712
"Now as Judy Wong reports down
at the courthouse,

478
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,255
there's a big protest. Judy?"

479
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,177
"Thanks, asshole.

480
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,429
That was my story,
I was gonna tell them that

481
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,807
but you managed to give away
the whole story before I can even speak.

482
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:47,851
Back to you, motherfucker."

483
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,566
I was thinking the next time
I buy a picture frame,

484
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:58,904
I could bring a photo of myself
and just slip it into the frame

485
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,156
before I get to the register.

486
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,496
When she's ringing up halfway through,
I'd be like, "What the...?

487
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,793
How did you get one of my before photos?"

488
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:24,471
How do you market a cruise to people?
That seems kind of hard.

489
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,556
"Hey, do you like hotels?"

490
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,724
"Yeah."

491
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,768
"How about one that could sink?"

492
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,399
Oh!

493
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,319
"I can drown in my bedroom? Wow! Okay.

494
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,157
I like that. Yeah, that does sound fun."

495
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:49,204
Pretty close to the top of the list
of ironic ways I would not wanna die

496
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:54,167
would be to drown in the swimming pool
on the deck of a cruise ship...

497
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,587
in the middle of the ocean.

498
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,134
"Do you hear about Demetri?"
"Yeah, he drowned in the Pacific Ocean."

499
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,137
"No, he drowned <i>on</i> the Pacific Ocean.

500
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:09,099
There's a boat there
that was totally fine.

501
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,560
He just found this one rectangle of water

502
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,605
and it was in there
that he managed to die.

503
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:19,276
What an idiot. That's terrible. Yeah.

504
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,445
Pretty embarrassing."

505
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,534
Balloons are great. You can use balloons
for so many different things.

506
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:30,203
But you can't grieve with balloons.
They are...

507
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,790
a little limited that way.
You know what I mean?

508
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:38,253
Like you can't show up to a funeral
with a bunch of black balloons

509
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,672
and be like,
"I am so sorry for your loss."

510
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,469
"Oh, thank you, these are... beautiful.

511
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,346
Guess I'll tie them to the casket."

512
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,476
"Pop 'em when you're ready.
When you're ready, just pop 'em."

513
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,978
"Oh, thank you. I appreciate that."

514
00:30:56,355 --> 00:31:00,317
It's weird to think about death
because it's the last thing that you do.

515
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,944
Your last verb is you die.

516
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,280
That's the last thing you do.

517
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,159
Unless you were body surfing,
you could argue that you, you know,

518
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,329
body surf for another 20 minutes
after you die, but...

519
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,083
I don't think that counts.

520
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,585
I don't know if that's you so much
at that point.

521
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,463
<i>I think I'm thirsty.</i>

522
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,631
<i>Yep.</i>

523
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,300
<i>Just get a quick drink.</i>

524
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,718
<i>There we go.</i>

525
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,889
<i>Oh, that is warm.</i>

526
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,892
- Water!
<i>- It's like I'm drinking bath water.</i>

527
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,685
It's a hot crowd.
That's a good crowd.

528
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,021
Whoo!

529
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,191
"How did your drinking water bit go?"
"Oh, it went great, man.

530
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,946
They liked it. They like me
a little bit thirsty for sure."

531
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:48,907
Whoo!

532
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,325
It's amazing being in an audience.

533
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:53,912
It's one of the few times that
you can have a conversation like that.

534
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,373
You say, "Whoo!"
Like that totally counts as a...

535
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,335
Your side of the conversation.
How you doing? Whoo!

536
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,047
Having a good night? Woo-hoo!

537
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,382
Whoo!

538
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:06,425
It's totally cool.

539
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,637
After the show, it would be kind of weird
if I ran into you on the street...

540
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,639
"Were you on my show?"

541
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,557
Whoo!

542
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,603
"You okay?" Woo-hoo!

543
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,399
"Do you have like a disorder?"

544
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,316
Whoo!

545
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,527
Whoo!

546
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,822
"I'm sorry." Woo-hoo.

547
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,245
I wonder if anybody ever
had a near-death experience

548
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:39,040
that just rolled into,
like, a regular death.

549
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,171
Do you what I mean?
Like, you're in the OR...

550
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,510
All of a sudden
you feel yourself leaving your body.

551
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,972
Now you're in the tunnel
and there's the bright light.

552
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,057
You're being drawn towards the light.

553
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:59,352
You're not even walking,
you're just floating towards the light

554
00:32:59,436 --> 00:33:00,312
through the darkness.

555
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,981
And you see a line of people
waiting for you

556
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,108
and you just feel love and warmth.

557
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:08,028
And here's your grandmother,
"Hello. Welcome."

558
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,198
Across from her is your great-grandfather.

559
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,033
You've never met him
but you know it's him.

560
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,160
"Young man, it's good to meet you.
Welcome!"

561
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,872
Here's your dog when you were a kid...

562
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:21,958
But you can understand him.
"Hello. Congratulations, sir."

563
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,960
Whatever they congratulate you
when you die.

564
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,550
Some friend from high school,
and people smiling and waiting for you.

565
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:32,886
And then suddenly, you freeze.

566
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:36,181
You start to go backwards.

567
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:39,226
The light is fading.
The line of people is receding.

568
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,687
Your grandmother's like,
"Goodbye. It wasn't your time, goodbye!"

569
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,983
You feel yourself
coming back into your body.

570
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:48,944
You're coming back. Something goes wrong.

571
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:53,490
Now you gotta go back...

572
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,035
down the tunnel.

573
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,414
Everybody's running back into position
your grandma's like, "Hello again..."

574
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,709
Your great-grandpa's like,
"This is very unusual, young man.

575
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:05,919
What are we doing here?"

576
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,547
Your dog like, " What the fuck?"
And then...

577
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:10,924
The light's in your eyes
at the wrong angle,

578
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,385
the guy is putting out a cigarette,
"Shit, this guy died!"

579
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,351
I don't have an ending for that joke,
it's just that...

580
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:24,896
The joke dies, just like we do.
It's just that...

581
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:28,066
It's okay.

582
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,779
They should have positive uses
for blow darts too.

583
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,616
Like if you have to get your kid
vaccinated.

584
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,161
Go to the paediatrician, he's like,

585
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,039
"Would you like regular
or a blow dart for the vaccination?"

586
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,709
"Oh! Yeah, let's try a blow dart.
That sounds good."

587
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:49,129
The kid's just like waiting on the table,
doctor pops in...

588
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,964
Ah!

589
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,052
"Sweetie, you're done! That's it.
You're vaccinated."

590
00:34:58,722 --> 00:34:59,556
Everybody wins.

591
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:02,642
The doctor's like, "I love my job.
This is the best part of the day."

592
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,230
The parent's like, "Yes! Nailed it."

593
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,318
And the kid has no fear,
there's no anticipation

594
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:14,571
leading up to, you know.
Until the next time he has to...

595
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,366
That is pretty much at the front door
of the doctor's office.

596
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,826
The kid's like, "Where is he?"

597
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,372
<i>Which bit should I do next? Hmm...</i>

598
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,500
<i>Uh... that one.</i>

599
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:34,549
This is called, "Fascinating Facts."

600
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,802
Some facts that I just wanna share
with you.

601
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:43,933
It is safer to fly in a plane
than it is to fly in a car.

00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:50,065
Drunk people are about 6,000 percent
less interesting than they think they are.

603
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,111
The term for the very tip of the scissors
is the "snipples."

604

Pandas are biracial.

605

About 75 percent
of German shepherds are dogs.

606
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,545
The other 25 percent are German shepherds.

607
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:17,634
White people are 50 times more likely
than people of any other race

608
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,802
use the word "neat-o."

609
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,517
Due to global warming, the polar ice caps
are now polar ice yarmulkes.

610
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:31,272
The most popular kind of prosthetic limb
in the world is the dildo.

611
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,320
Wednesday is spelled wrong.

612
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,369
By simply adding a ponytail,

613
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,579
a man can remove
up to all of his credibility.

614
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,920
Nearly one half of all Americans
are torsos.

615
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,968
The word "hurdle"
comes from the Danish word

616
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,344
meaning "testicle paddle."

617
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,058
People who are vegan not only live longer
they're also more annoying.

618
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:14,232
New Jersey is the only state
you can smell from other states.

619
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,780
In rare circumstances,
the leap year falls on a hump day.

620
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,407
This is known as the "leap hump."

621
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,328
You're more likely to die
in a terrible accident

622
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,788
than in a wonderful accident.

623
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,460
The capital of Alaska is "A."

624
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:41,634
By the age of 90, the average person
has already been dead for eight years.

625
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,015
No one has ever successfully
blown a French kiss to another person.

626
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,395
Men are about 800 times
more likely than women

627
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,647
to fart into a bag
at some point in their lives.

628
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:02,405
Experts believe there's about 25 percent
more camouflage in the world

629
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:03,448
than we realize.

630
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,079
The term for the very bottom of the banana
is the "ban-anus."

631
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,668
There are fewer and fewer magicians
in the world

632
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:17,670
due to the difficulty
they have reproducing.

633
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,592
The Heimlich manoeuvre can also be done
on someone who's constipated.

634
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:31,726
Sex... is the leading cause of people.

635
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:38,900
All right.

636
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,035
<i>All right, that worked pretty well.</i>

637
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,122
<i>All right, I should keep the show moving.
Hurry up.</i>

638
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:57,669
Okay.

639
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,840
<i>Oh, maybe I could do a bit
with the mic stand.</i>

640
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:12,851
<i>No, that's not my style.</i>

641
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,354
I was driving and I saw a signage
that said, "Hidden Driveway,"

642
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,648
and I was like, "Well, you just ruined it!

643
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,277
Let me figure that out!"

644
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,741
Sometimes when I'm driving and I get like,
road rage pretty badly, you know,

645
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:31,202
and I don't have the physique
to back it up. I...

646
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:35,248
It's such a mismatch between my anger
and what I could actually do to anybody,

647
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,165
I can't...

648
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,419
I can solve some puzzles really quickly
in front of them,

649
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,546
they'd be like,
"Shit, this guy threw me off."

650
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:45,884
Part of the problem with road rage

651
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:49,012
is that we don't have an adequate way
to communicate with each other.

652
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,892
We have a very limited vocabulary
we could say "thank you" and "fuck you."

653
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,060
That's the two things we can say.

654
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,063
That's pretty limited
'cause sometimes I make a mistake

655
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,233
and then I wish I had a gesture
to go with it.

656
00:40:02,317 --> 00:40:06,112
You can't really apologize, like,
or cut a guy off and like, "Oh, shit."

657
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,656
And he catches up to me
and I gotta be like...

658
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,998
"From your perspective. Fuck me.
You see? I'm on your side here."

659
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,209
There's no "I'm sorry."
I can't be like, "I'm sorry.

660
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,839
I'm sad for what I did.

661
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,885
Okay?" "What the hell is this guy doing?
Is he a mime?"

662
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,556
The car horn's even worse.
That's just like instant aggression.

663
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,142
It's like yelling "hey" at someone.

664
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,519
You hit the horn and like, "Hey! Hey!"

665
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,148
Sometimes I tap it,
I'm not trying to be a dick here,

666
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,359
I'm just trying to, you know,
use it gently.

667
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,944
I think it comes out, "Hey."

668
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,320
But it doesn't. It comes out, "Hey!"

669
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,367
You can't take it back
if you make a mistake with the horns.

670
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,912
Sometimes I wish I could take it back.
I wish there was like a second button

671
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,957
next to the horn,
that was like a reverse horn sound,

672
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,669
you know what I mean?
So you could just like, take it back.

673
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,130
Like I was waiting to make a left
at the light, it was like the second car.

674
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,799
The light changes, the guy doesn't go.

675
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,634
"Fucking go!" you know?

676
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,762
Then I see the old man
walking through the intersection.

677
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,307
Now I look like a lunatic.

678
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,559
I was basically saying,
"Get him! Hit him!"

679
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,607
I wish I could take that back, though.

680
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:25,942
Then I see the old man.

681
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:33,741
"Okay, cool. You're not a dick.
I hear you, that's fine."

682
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,999
I love GPS.
I use that a lot when I'm driving.

683
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:43,084
For comedians, it's great.
We go to all these cities.

684
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,546
We don't know where anything is.
GPS just tells you how to get there.

685
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:50,341
And I learned recently
that I could change the gender of the GPS,

686
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,844
or the accent, which is kind of cool.

687
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,138
You can't change
the tone of voice, though.

688
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,848
I wish you could change the tone of voice.

689
00:41:56,931 --> 00:42:00,393
You could have like different
emotional connection with the GPS

690
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,687
depending on
what you're going through, you know?

691
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,065
If you're running late
you could pick like "urgent."

692
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,944
"Okay. In two-tenths of a mile,
make a right on the light. Go, go, go!"

693
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,451
Or if you're driving late at night
on a highway,

694
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,953
you're getting drowsy,
you just pick, like, "alarming."

695
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:21,247
"In a quarter mile, you're gonna die!"

696
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,625
"Oh, shit. GPS, thank you."

697
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,045
"My God, you scared the shit out of me.
Where am I?"

698
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,008
"Reluctant" would be really good
for somebody like me.

699
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,263
"At the roundabout,
take the second exit."

700
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,517
"Do you even wanna go
to this baby shower?"

701
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,105
No.

702
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,817
"Then make a legal U-turn,
and let's fucking go home."

703
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,030
Thanks, GPS, you're right.

704
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,328
I can't wait till we have driverless cars
everywhere. That'll be cool.

705
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,914
It'll only be a matter of time
before people figure out

706
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,916
that they can just get a car
for their dogs.

707
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:07,835
"Honey, where are the dogs?"

708
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,588
"I got them a car,
they're driving around for an hour."

709
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,092
Can you imagine being in a red light

710
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,094
and a car full of dogs
pulls up next to you?

711
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,061
Incredible.
The dogs are having a great time.

712
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,438
The driver dog's like,
"I knew I could do this."

713
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,278
If you get into an accident with dogs,
how mad are you gonna be?

714
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,281
You get out of the car, "Son of a bitch.

715
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,158
Hello."

716
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,621
"Where's your insurance?
Get your insurance. Good boy."

717
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:51,087
I wonder if in the future, if robots
will be such a regular part of our lives,

718
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,923
it will be considered offensive
to do "The Robot."

719
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,178
You're in a party like,
"Hey, man, check me out."

720
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:00,096
Whoa!

721
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,933
"What are you doing?"
"Freaking robbies. I don't give a shit."

722
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:05,977
"Did you say 'robbies'?"

723
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:09,313
Those are Technical-Americans."

724
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,697
Sometimes when you make a job title
sound more politically correct,

725
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,449
it actually sounds worse, you know.

726
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,495
"Your father's not a garbage man.
He's a garbage person."

727
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:28,124
"Yep."

728
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,296
"Your dad's a piece of shit is what
I'm trying to say. You understand?"

729
00:44:37,592 --> 00:44:40,052
Sometimes people say,
"I forgive, but I don't forget."

730
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,555
Sounds pretty cool.

731
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,184
I'd like to hear,
"I forget, but I don't forgive."

732
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:51,230
"Who the hell are you, you son of a bitch?

733
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,903
I'm mad at a lot of people
and I don't know who they are."

734
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,076
I feel like people are saying things,

735
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,621
like they don't even think through
what they're saying.

736
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,874
I was in a fitting room
at a clothing store,

737
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:12,251
and I come out and the lady goes,
"How'd you do?"

738
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,590
"Uh, bad. I did bad. I, uh...

739
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,760
I put the sweater on my legs. I just...

740
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,721
I blew it. I blew it. I panicked.

741
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,223
I got in as if I got a plan.
Before I knew it,

742
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,017
my legs were right in there
on those sleeves.

743
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,186
And just standing there and I...

744
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,563
farted quietly and I came back. I just...

745
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,858
But thank you for asking
such a patronizing question

746
00:45:35,942 --> 00:45:38,110
to a grown man on how I did."

747
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,406
When I go to buy things,
a lot of times, at the register,

748
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:44,700
they ask me if I "found everything okay."

749
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,203
I don't know if that's a trend
or if I just look

750
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:49,538
like I can't find shit in a store
or something.

751
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,749
Or it's like,
"Did you find everything okay?"

752
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,751
I'll just say, "Yes. Yeah, I did. Yes."

753
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,797
You can never say, "No." right?
"Do you find everything okay?"

754
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:01,676
"No. I didn't find anything okay.

755
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,053
Your store's impossible.

756
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,306
I've been here for three hours
looking for stuff. I can't find a thing.

757
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,435
This is all random shit.
I don't want any of this. This is just..."

758
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,065
I got this because I knew you were
gonna ask if I found stuff okay.

759
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,359
But I just took random stuff. I..."

760
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,363
What if you say no?
What are they even gonna do for you?

761
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,906
"Do you find everything okay?" "No."

762
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,993
"Okay. Shut down my register,
I'm gonna help him find stuff okay.

763
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,161
Come on, stupid,
let's find stuff together. You're dumb."

764
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:30,955
"Thank you. Yeah, I can't find stuff okay.

765
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,791
Can you carry me by the hand?
I want that. Could you..."

766
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,836
"You found it? You're okay?"
"I'm okay." "Good, fine." "Okay."

767
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,632
At a dinner party, I heard a guy say,

768
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:43,843
"I believe everything happens
for a reason."

769
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,263
And I wanted to smack him
in the face, you know.

770
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,058
He'll be like,
"What the hell did you do that for?"

771
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,060
"You tell me."

772
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,446
"That's your belief, man.
That's your thing. I don't know. Your...

773
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:08,242
Your Lord lifted my hand and it hit him.
This is part of His plan.

774
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:12,121
He will see the reason in the future."
"Okay."

775
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,667
I love jokes.
I love telling jokes because...

776
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:19,545
there's something really economical
about a good joke.

777
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:23,174
It breaks down a bunch of ideas
into just a sentence or two.

778
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,009
I've always loved that, actually.

779
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:28,179
From day one as a comic,
I've just been drawn to jokes.

780
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,557
And I've noticed now,
being a little bit older,

781
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,352
that there have been times in my life
where I ended up almost in a joke.

782
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:39,065
Where I'm kind of in my own one-liner
whether I like it or not.

783
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:42,485
It doesn't happen often,
but I'll give you an example.

784
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,944
It's almost 10 years ago, now.

785
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,698
I was living in New York alone
in a six-floor walk-up.

786
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:51,035
No elevator, this whole building,
with six floors up to the top.

787
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:55,748
And I had this tiny apartment.
I was single, I was over 30.

788
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,668
One night, I was getting ready to go out,
it was like a trivial moment.

789
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,546
But then I said a sentence out loud
to myself.

790
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:06,425
It was like a perfect snapshot of my life
at that moment.

791
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,844
And right after I said it, I was like,

792
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,387
"Oh, my God.
I'm probably gonna remember that."

793
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,723
And I think about it often.
It was really simple.

794
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,934
I was in my apartment,
getting ready to go out,

795
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,229
and I said angrily out loud to myself...

796
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,482
"Where the fuck is my tambourine?"

797
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,240
Right there, what series of choices
did this man make...

798
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,703
to be this angry
about the location of a tambourine?

799
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,416
"I got some jingling to do
and I don't have time to fuck around.

800
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,714
People are counting on me."

801
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,219
It just like stayed with me.
You know what I mean?

802
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:54,014
It became like a big moment
in my life now. It defines me.

803
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:58,936
Well, fast forward to last winter.

804
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,647
Now I'm married. I have two little kids.

805
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:05,192
And I went on vacation with my family.

806
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:07,444
We went to Lake Tahoe for Christmas break.

807
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,488
It was great. We had a great time.

808
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:12,116
It was beautiful.
It snowed, you know, white Christmas.

809
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:16,036
One morning, my wife said,
"Why don't we go out for breakfast today?"

810
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,414
I said, "That's a great idea,
let's go out."

811
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:21,834
We put the kids in the car
and she navigated, I drove.

812
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,129
She's Yelping.
She's trying to find a restaurant

813
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,673
that will satisfy our requirements,

814
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:31,260
which is not that easy because we have
dietary restrictions between us.

815
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:34,680
She's lactose intolerant.
She can't have gluten.

816
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:38,100
She's one of those people, it messes up
her stomach. She's got her thing.

817
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,603
Me, I've got life-threatening
food allergies.

818
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,354
So that's pretty nice, so...

819
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,816
If I eat a peanut, I die. So that's...

820
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:48,611
I can't see any good use for that.

821
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,446
I've never really seen a benefit

822
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,073
that comes from that allergy, you know.

823
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:57,286
Unless, I don't know, if I were depressed.
If I had a really rough stretch,

824
00:49:57,369 --> 00:50:01,415
I don't need a gun or a bridge
or you know, I mean, I could...

825
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:03,792
just go to a 7/11, really.

826
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:06,462
I'll pop in there
and grab a Reese's peanut butter cup.

827
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,005
I'm not paying for it,
'cause I'm gonna kill myself.

828
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,840
So, I'll just grab the peanut butter...

829
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:14,136
ram it in my mouth, and just dead,
right in front of the guy at the register.

830
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,556
I'm sure he'd be like,
"What the hell was that about?"

831
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,269
I wouldn't do that.
I'm not gonna do that because...

832
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,898
If you think about it, that's the grossest
form of littering, in a sense.

833
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,068
Anyway, between the two of us,

834
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,738
we're just the worst table
you're ever gonna wait on. It's just...

835
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:36,617
She finds this place.
We find this kind of healthy place.

836
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,995
We go, we park.
We come inside, it's totally packed.

837
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:42,873
This is a good sign.
I guess this is a popular restaurant.

838
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:44,917
There's a table way over
on the other side over here.

839
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:45,876
We get the table.

840
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,671
You got to go up to the register
and order your food,

841
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,590
then they give you a little metal stand
and your number.

842
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,134
They'll bring you the food. So we ordered.

843
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:57,054
We both get eggs and toast
and some stuff for the kids.

844
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,889
We were sitting, waiting for our food.

845
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,683
Story picks up, I promise. So...

846
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,645
They bring our food out,
I get all my stuff.

847
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,063
She doesn't get her toast.

848
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:08,357
See, I got the regular toast and the eggs.

849
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,111
But she got the gluten-free toast,
which comes like, one piece at a time,

850
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:17,658
It's got like rocks and feathers in it.
It's this special sort of dust and clay.

851
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,285
Whatever this thing is.

852
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:21,287
Looks like a regular piece of toast
from a distance.

853
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,415
If you get closer, it looks like a kid
pieced it together.

854
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:25,332
She didn't get her toast.

855
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:28,127
Her eggs are getting cold
and she's getting pissed off.

856
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,963
She's looking, the manager comes out,
"Is everything okay?"

857
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,798
She said,
"I ordered the gluten-free toast.

858
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,466
I haven't gotten it
and my eggs are getting cold."

859
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:35,634
And he said, "Okay."

860
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,220
Here's where the story picks up.
He goes, "Brian!"

861
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:39,179
He calls over.

862
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:41,807
We looked across the room
and standing next to the kitchen door

863
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,311
is Brian, this very Olympic-looking
bus boy with...

864
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,732
just big shoulders, a beard, tiny apron.

865
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:53,235
He's just a big guy, kind of
a lumberjack-snowboarder hybrid.

866
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,530
He looks like a superhero,
but he's got this ridiculous little apron.

867
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,034
He looks funny to me and I'm like,
"I'm interested, there's something here."

868
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,786
"Brian, gluten-free toast."

869
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:06,081
The guy just nods,
disappears into the kitchen.

870
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,082
So now we're eating.

871
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,751
And a few minutes later,

872
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,712
I see my wife make a face
I've never seen her make before.

873
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:15,341
So I look where she's looking,
and there's Brian.

874
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,927
He's come out of the kitchen
with my wife's piece of toast...

875
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:20,971
in his hand.

876
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:27,978
He's just making his way
through the crowded restaurant,

877
00:52:28,062 --> 00:52:30,272
just holding the one piece of toast.

878
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,566
I've never had this experience before.

879
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:37,321
Seeing a grown man carry a piece of toast
bareback through a restaurant, just...

880
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,241
In his hand. In my whole life,
I've just never seen this move.

881
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,826
But he's got the toast...

882
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:44,870
He gets to our table,
doesn't say anything.

883
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,413
He just holds up the toast.

884
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,335
My wife just takes it in her hands
and she's like, "Thank you?"

885
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,420
And she puts it on the plate.
He walks away.

886
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,589
We both burst out laughing.
We're just like...

887
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,884
I'm immediately taken out of my life
which is incredible.

888
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,928
I've transcended regular experience,

889
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,765
and he's transported me by the simple act
of carrying the toast like that.

890
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,143
I'm now wondering, "Who's Brian?
What's his story? I wanna know about him.

891
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:10,646
Tell me everything about this guy.
What just happened?"

892
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:14,775
So, I started immediately theorizing
and saying to my wife,

893
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,861
"I think it's probably one of two things,
what we just witnessed.

894
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:21,740
Number one, he's being a dick.
He's in a bad mood. He's having a bad day.

895
00:53:21,824 --> 00:53:24,535
And that was it, something just broke."
You know what I mean?

896
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,662
"Maybe the manager
is his uncle or something?

897
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,415
He wasn't supposed to work today,
called him in last minute,

898
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:30,999
he doesn't even wanna be here.

899
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:34,253
And your gluten-free toast
was the last straw for Brian."

900
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:37,840
And he was like, "Goddamn toast.
Here's your stupid toast, lady."

901
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:41,176
"If your mouth were open, he'd probably
have shoved it right into your mouth.

902
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:45,264
He's in a bad mood. He's lashing out.
We're caught in the crossfire here."

903
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,767
And I was like,
"Or two, he's not being a dick.

904
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,353
I'm judging him too harshly.
Maybe he's totally nice.

905
00:53:51,437 --> 00:53:54,815
He's a good person. He's just dumb.
He's not a smart guy."

906
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,860
He was just like, "Toast, toast,
got to remember gluten-free toast.

907
00:53:57,943 --> 00:54:01,196
Get the lady her toast.
Got to get the toast. Here's the toast."

908
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,490
Trying to remember one thing,
"Toast, toast, toast."

909
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,075
There he is back in his position,

910
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,744
"More toast, what's next?
Tell me. Tell Brian 'toast.'"

911
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,498
Either way,
I don't think it's a good situation

912
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,417
we've gotten ourselves into here."

913
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:15,669
Then, she wasn't gonna eat the toast.

914
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:18,046
And then I started to get philosophical,

915
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,215
'cause I was like,
"Hold on. Think about it.

916
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:23,927
Okay, so he touched your toast.
But think, when the toast pops up,

917
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:27,973
they touch the toast, put it on a plate
then bring it to you on a plate.

918
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:31,143
Is there that big a difference
between going like that with the toast,

919
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,313
and going like this and carrying it
for an extra 80 seconds

920
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:35,856
and putting it on your plate?"

921
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,317
I'm like, "No. it doesn't really matter."

922
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,653
I was like, "Your toast has been touched.
He touched it in the kitchen.

923
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:45,532
It's not like they're catching it
on sterile plates. "Can't touch."

924
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:48,243
I was like, "They touched your toast.
He touched it, wiped his head with it,

925
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,870
they passed it around the kitchen.

926
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,624
It's just like, that's backstage."

927
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:56,251
I went on this whole thing
about the "theater" of restaurants

928
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:59,671
and how we're "out in the house"
and that's "backstage."

929
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:03,342
In the middle of my speech,
I guess we're making kind of a commotion.

930
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:04,510
The manager comes over,

931
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,346
and he goes to my wife,
"Is everything okay?"

932
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,973
And she goes...
And before she can say anything, he goes,

933
00:55:10,516 --> 00:55:12,476
"Did Brian carry the toast
over in his hand?"

934
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,902
This has happened before.

935
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:25,948
<i>I think I'm done.</i>

936
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:29,910
<i>Am I, though?</i>

937
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,121
<i>Good night, everybody. Thank you.</i>

938
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,665
<i>Good night.</i>
