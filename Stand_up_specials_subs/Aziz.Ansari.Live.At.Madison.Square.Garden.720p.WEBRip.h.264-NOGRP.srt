1
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,136
Thank you so much.

2
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:38,641
Thank you very much, New York.
Holy shit.

3
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,644
This is Madison Square Garden.
Oh, my God.

4
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,900
Bring the house lights up for a second.

5
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,778
Let's just see everybody here a second.
Bring the house lights up.

6
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,912
Thank you. Thank you so much
to all 12,000 of you

7
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:03,165
predominantly white people
that showed up tonight. I really--

8
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,419
No, there's minorities in the mix.
I'm just kidding. Yeah.

9
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:12,424
Uh, I'm a...

10
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,720
I'm a minority, and I am...

11
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:20,557
Yeah, I am the first generation
in my family that was born in America.

12
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:23,894
Anybody else first-generation people?
Yeah? Clap, yeah?

13
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,312
Yeah!

14
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,649
Pretty amazing thing
our parents did, right?

15
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:30,525
They came to this country.

16
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,711
They maybe didn't know anyone,

17
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:33,922
maybe didn't even speak the language,
and they figured it out.

18
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:35,322
Very brave, courageous thing.

19
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,605
And I feel like we never sit down
and thank them for it.

20
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:41,036
And we should, 'cause that's
such an amazing thing, you know,

21
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,330
for someone in your family
to at some point,

22
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,622
to just be like,

23
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:48,043
"You know what? Fuck China!
Let's get out of here. Let's go.

24
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,922
Let's get out of here. I'm tired of living
in this village. Let's go. Let's go.

25
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,342
Let's move to America.
I've seen photos online, it looks dope.

26
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:58,345
Let's go. Let's go."

27
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,973
'Cause you know they had
friends that were dicks

28
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,100
that were like, "What?
You can't move to America.

29
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,286
You don't know anyone there.
You don't speak the language.

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,729
What are you gonna do for work?"

31
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,247
"I don't know, man.
We'll figure it out.

32
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,817
Worst-case scenario, we'll cook food
and we'll sell it to white people, okay?"

33
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,947
"You got a Master's degree in Chemistry.
You don't know how to cook."

34
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,075
"They don't know
what Chinese food tastes like!

35
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,745
I'll just put some chicken in a box
with some orange sauce

36
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,868
and I'll serve it to 'em."

37
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,999
"Ooh! What are you gonna call that dish?
Orange chicken?"

38
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,292
"Yeah! Maybe I will
call it orange chicken!

39
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,254
Maybe I'll call it Number 36.
We'll see!"

40
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:35,957
Pretty amazing, though, right?

41
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,218
Like, all those stories,
they're amazing to me.

42
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,428
Amazing stories.
I hear immigrants say stories like,

43
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:42,848
"Oh, I came to Brooklyn
with $20 in my pocket."

44
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:43,932
That's incredible.

45
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,393
Is our generation that amazing?
I don't think we are.

46
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,478
I don't think we're as amazing
as our parents are.

47
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,206
I don't think we can
pull that kind of shit off.

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,817
Like, could you imagine if you sent me
to Brooklyn with $20 in my pocket?

49
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:58,655
I'd get there the first day and be like,
"Oh, man, I'm out of money!

50
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:03,160
I just bought too much
fresh pressed juice!

51
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,494
Guess I gotta move back."

52
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,873
"Hey, Dad.
Yeah, I'm coming back to India, huh.

53
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,332
Things didn't work out here.

54
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,919
Uh, I made a bad investment in juice."

55
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,090
My parents told me
a little bit about their struggles.

56
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,926
They moved to South Carolina.

57
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,718
That's where they chose-- Yeah!

58
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:24,514
'Cause they were trying to find a place
that combined racism...

59
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,268
and horrible public schools...

60
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,788
and they're like, "Ooh, South Carolina!

61
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:33,231
You're right in the middle of this
very unnecessary Venn diagram.

62
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:35,192
Let's do this!"

63
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,072
And, you know,
they told me a little bit about it.

64
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,865
And, you know, my mom told me

65
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,827
her first day in America
was the scariest day of her life.

66
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,512
And I was like,
"Wow, why do you say that?"

67
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,431
She's like, "Well, I got here.
I didn't know anyone.

68
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,999
I was so far away from
my friends and family.

69
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,542
Uh, I barely even knew your father."

70
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,961
They had an arranged marriage

71
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,604
and she'd known him for, like,
a week at that point.

72
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,629
This is serious.

73
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:00,133
And she said she got here
and she's in this small apartment,

74
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,735
it's empty and
she didn't know what to do,

75
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,011
and she felt so scared.

76
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,823
I was like,
"What did you do that first day?"

77
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,389
She's like,
"I didn't know what to do.

78
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,725
I was all alone.
Your dad was at work the whole day.

79
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,228
And I just sat on the couch
and I cried."

80
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,397
I was like, "Oh, that's so sad.
How did you get through that?"

81
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,401
And she's like,
"It was just one of those moments

82
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:18,502
where I just knew
I had to be brave and figure it out.

83
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,488
You ever had moments like that,
Aziz, where you were so scared,

84
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:24,074
but you knew you had to be brave
and figure it out?"

85
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,158
And I was like...

86
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,702
"No!

87
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,623
My life is super easy
'cause you did all the struggling.

88
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,376
So, my shit's really easy."

89
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,669
I'm not gonna have any struggles
to tell my kids about.

90
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,953
What's my story gonna be like?

91
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:42,092
"Oh, son, once, when I was flying
from New York to LA...

92
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,513
my iPad died."

93
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,019
My kid will be like, "Fuck you, Dad.
We're teleporting to Mars!"

94
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,194
My dad told me
a little bit about his struggles.

95
00:05:58,275 --> 00:05:59,484
My dad's a doctor.

96
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,737
And he said when he first got here,
it was very hard

97
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,990
'cause the head of the hospital
was very racist

98
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,342
and would never send him patients.

99
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,285
He'd always send patients
to another doctor

100
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,702
that lived three hours away.

101
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,015
And I was like, "Oh, that stinks.
How did you figure that out?"

102
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,724
And he said,
"Well, what eventually happened was

103
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,626
the head of the hospital got very sick
and he had a stomach problem."

104
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,503
My dad is a stomach doctor.

105
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,982
And so he called for my dad.
He's like, "Oh, send that Indian guy in.

106
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,733
I don't want to go to the guy
three hours away."

107
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,467
And my mom was like,
"You shouldn't go.

108
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,195
That guy's racist,
he never sends you patients.

109
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,262
Why should you go?"

110
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,389
My dad was like,
"No, I'm gonna go,

111
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,017
'cause I think we need to be
the bigger people here."

112
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,811
So my dad goes
and he starts treating the guy.

113
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,272
And then my dad
poisons him and kills him.

114
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,234
And then my dad became
the head of the hospital.

115
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,254
And that's what you gotta do
when you're an immigrant!

116
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,279
Handle your shit!

117
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,739
Kill some racist motherfuckers
if you need to!

118
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,372
How many of you guys--
Clap if you don't eat meat.

119
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,624
Anyone here not eat meat?
Clap if you don't eat meat.

120
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,335
Okay.

121
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:02,839
Now, clap if you don't eat meat
'cause, um, you saw a documentary

122
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,026
or you read a book that freaked you out
about the meat industry.

123
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,343
Clap if that's the situation.

124
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,802
A few people.

125
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,513
Now, clap if you've just
seen that stuff in general.

126
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,917
Like, video of a factory farm
or read something that, like,

127
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,243
freaked you out
about the food industry.

128
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,936
Clap if you've seen that stuff, yeah?

129
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,770
That's a lot of people.

130
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,231
Now, clap if you saw that stuff

131
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,399
and you're like,
"Oh, my God, that's disgusting.

132
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,068
It's cruel, it's inhumane.

133
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,613
The government definitely needs to
properly regulate the meat industry.

134
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,780
There's no excuse for this.

135
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,534
The government definitely needs to
properly regulate the meat industry.

136
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,537
But, in the meantime...

137
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,164
I kinda still gotta eat meat

138
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,568
'cause I don't want to feel
weird and hungry all the time."

139
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,172
Isn't that so frustrating?

140
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:47,592
'Cause no one wants to support that stuff.
But you know what the problem is?

141
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:50,178
Salads need to
step their game up, okay?

142
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,097
Like, salads aren't
bringing it hard enough.

143
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,807
Vegetables aren't
bringing it hard enough.

144
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,852
If food is a basketball game,
meat is killing it.

145
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,772
Meat is just like, "Ribs!

146
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:03,066
Fried chicken!

147
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,776
Steak!"

148
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,361
Meanwhile, vegetables are like,

149
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,822
"Uh, does anyone want any cauliflower?

150
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,784
What about some snow peas?

151
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,245
Does anyone like Brussels sprouts?"

152
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,291
"Yeah, I'll take those Brussels sprouts
and I'll wrap 'em in some bacon!"

153
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:24,504
That's how powerful meat is, right?

154
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,232
You go into a kitchen,
you smell bacon and go,

155
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,509
"Are you cooking bacon right now?
Is that bacon you're making right--

156
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,636
Is there any way you have
a second piece of bacon

157
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,430
that I could eat as well?
Is there any..."

158
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,074
No one's ever walked
into a kitchen like,

159
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,059
"Are you steaming carrots right now?

160
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,601
Are you steaming carrots?

161
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,188
I can smell the steam
from the other room.

162
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:44,191
Is that some broccoli and cauliflower?
Are you making a medley right now?

163
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,319
Are you making a motherfucking
steamed vegetable medley right now?

164
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,362
Oh, don't tell me that's
brown rice in that bowl!

165
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,905
Don't tell me that's brown rice!

166
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,408
You better fix me a plate now!"

167
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,556
Even if you don't eat meat,
even if you're just eating vegetables,

168
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,599
do you know everything
that goes into the vegetables?

169
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,435
There's all this messed-up stuff
with vegetables, too,

170
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,169
like child labor
and all these issues.

171
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,754
Like, how come every vegetable's
always in season, right?

172
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:08,478
Every vegetable's
always in season, right?

173
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,550
You never go to the grocery store
and they're like,

174
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,861
"We don't have asparagus at the moment.
They're just not growing."

175
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,012
No, no, no.
They have everything all the time.

176
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,433
'Cause if it's not growing here,
they just go to South America,

177
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,953
and there's some guy with a sword
going up to little kids like,

178
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:25,148
"Dígame, dígame! Pick the asparagus!
Pick it! Pick it! Pick it!

179
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,817
People in America need to eat it

180
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,653
and see if it really
makes their pee smell weird!"

181
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:39,537
Just never google how anything
you consume is created.

182
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:42,374
Just never google it,
'cause it's always gonna bum you out.

183
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,667
I used to buy this orange juice
called Simply OJ,

184
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,670
'cause I'm dumb and I see
words like "simple" and "natural,"

185
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,381
and I'm like,
"Mmm, okay, well, clearly,

186
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:52,717
there must be a grandma
squeezing oranges into a bucket,

187
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,178
and, you know,
then she pours that in a little bottle."

188
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,305
No, no, no, no, no.

189
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,349
That's what was happening
for, like, three months,

190
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,017
and then Coca-Cola
bought the company.

191
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,686
They slit the grandma's throat...

192
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,149
and now a bunch of little Asian kids
just jizz into a banana peel,

193
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,317
and that's Simply OJ.

194
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,611
Something like that.
I can't...

195
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,946
quite remember the specifics, but...

196
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,491
something like that.

197
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,035
Everything, man! Eggs!
You know how they make eggs?

198
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,912
This is how they make eggs, okay?

199
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,416
They genetically engineer
two different types of chicken.

200
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,299
One type of chicken
is called the layer chick.

201
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,377
Just lays eggs, right?

202
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,772
And they have another type of chick
called a broiler chick.

203
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,940
This is the chicken they, like,
pump up with a bunch of hormones

204
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:35,677
so it has, like, huge breasts and legs,
and that's the one they use for the meat.

205
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,222
And I'm reading this, I'm like, "Well,
what happens to the male layer chicks?"

206
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,765
They serve no purpose, right?

207
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,184
They can't lay eggs.

208
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,827
They can't be used for meat.
What happens?

209
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,479
They just get murdered!
In insane ways.

210
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,440
Like, they'll take
all the male layer chicks

211
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,151
and they'll throw 'em
into a big chicken woodchipper.

212
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,028
Um, another thing they'll do
is they'll put 'em in a big plastic vat

213
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:56,048
and just put a lid on it
and suffocate 'em to death.

214
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,533
And, yeah, it's a bummer.
Like, none of us is into that.

215
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,118
Like, we'd all check "No" on that box.

216
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,163
But the problem is,

217
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:04,848
this kind of information,
this kind of footage,

218
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:08,460
it just hasn't been seen
in the right context

219
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,295
to elicit the kind of mass outrage

220
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,147
that would actually result
in some changes, you know.

221
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,467
Right now, it's in these obscure
documentaries or books or whatever.

222
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,760
But what if it was
in a different context?

223
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:24,058
Like, what if there was a CNN camera crew
that did a raid at rapper Ja Rule's house?

224
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,060
And they saw
he had a big plastic vat

225
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,145
where he was just suffocating
chickens to death.

226
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,441
We'd all be like, "Ja, you monster!
What are you doing?"

227
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,402
And he'd be like, "I'm sorry,
I just wanted some eggs!

228
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:39,241
I had to make ethical compromises
in order to achieve economies of scale!

229
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,784
♪ It's murda!" ♪

230
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,581
I'll admit,
when I first wrote that joke,

231
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,709
I was like,
"But will people remember Ja Rule?"

232
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,255
Oh, how foolish I was!

233
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,300
If you're not familiar with Ja, um...

234
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,596
he had a strange string of hits
a few years ago, where...

235
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,307
every song followed
this very strange formula

236
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,410
where they'd have a woman
with a very beautiful voice,

237
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,562
like Jennifer Lopez or Ashanti,

238
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,855
and they would sing the hook.

239
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,232
And then Ja would come in
and sound like

240
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:17,404
someone that was getting stabbed
in the stomach through their ulcer.

241
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,489
Like, every single song
was just like,

242
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,157
♪ R-U-L-E ♪

243

245
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,583
♪ And what am I doing here? ♪

246
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,881
I feel like I gotta do that whole bit
on a talk show or something.

247
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,384
'Cause whenever you do
a bit like that on a talk show,

248
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,844
the person always
gets in touch with you.

249
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,113
So I feel like I have to do it,

250
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:47,309
just so I can get that amazing phone call
one day, where it's just like, "Aziz?"

251
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,438
- "Yeah. Who is this?"
- "Ja Rule, baby!

252
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,440
Saw the way you integrated me

253
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,983
into that bit about factory farming
in the egg industry!

254
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,653
I never knew that shit!
I'm never eatin' meat again!

255
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,238
You know where I can get
some more literature on this subject?

256
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:04,701
Maybe a pamphlet on how to adjust
to a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle?

♪ Put it on me!" ♪

258

Soon, Ja starts getting
really passionate about the cause.

259
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,961
He starts filming his own PSAs.

260

They're shittin' all over each other

stand-up bit to showcase

my frustrations
with the meat industry...

Ja Rule impersonation...

then you'd know my struggle.

273
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,340
You know what
I've realized recently?

274
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,094
Creepy dudes are everywhere...

275
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,097
and they're so much more prevalent
than I ever realized.

276
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,477
And it really sucks, 'cause women have
to worry about creepy dudes all the time.

277
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,481
And it's very unfair because
men never worry about creepy women.

278
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,108
Like, men never are concerned
about creepy women.

279
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,192
That's not a thing.

280
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,486
There's never been two dudes,

281
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,280
walking alone,
late night in a park, like...

282
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,661
- "Hey, man, I think we should speed up."
- "Why, what's going on?"

283
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,414
"I'm pretty sure that woman
behind the tree is masturbating to us!"

284
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,959
"Oh, God! Oh, God! Should we get a cab?
Should we just keep running? Ahh!"

285
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,672
No two dudes have
ever faced that dilemma.

286
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:42,965
There's never been a dude
who's told a story like this,

287
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,528
"Yeah, so I'm at the club, like,
minding my own business, right?

288
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,405
And then this creepy woman
comes up to me. She's like,

289
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,031
'Hey, can I buy you a drink?'
I'm like, 'No, I'm fine.'

290
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,198
'Let me buy you a drink.'
'No, I'm fine.'

291
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,324
She's like,
'Let me buy you a drink!'

292
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,809
I'm like, 'Okay, okay, okay.'

293
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,519
And so, you know,
she buys me a drink

294
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,772
and I take a sip to be polite,
and then she's just like...

295
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,360
that's a nice set of balls
you got down there.

296
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,614
What do you think about me
sucking on one of those bad boys later?'

297
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:09,283
And I was like,
'Uh, that's quite all right.'

298
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,429
And she's like,
'Oh, but you'll drink the drink, though!

299
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,693
You'll drink the drink, though!

300
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,748
To be clear, I can't suck the balls,
but you'll drink the drink, though!

301
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,072
You'll drink the drink, though!

302
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,043
You're twisted!

303
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,798
Ladies, let's get out of this club!
Dudes here are busted!'"

304
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,926
No dude has that story.

305
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,847
No dude's ever barged up into
his friend's apartment in a panic, like,

306
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,033
"Oh, my God! Dude, I'm so sorry!
I didn't know where else to go!

307
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,183
This is so crazy!
Oh, my God!

308
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,161
I'm so freaked out right now!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

309
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,312
I was walking down Third Avenue,

310
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:41,107
and this woman just
whipped her pussy out at me.

311
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,152
And she just started chasing me like,
'Ahh! Do you wanna touch it?'"

312
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:48,448
No guy here has any story like that.

313
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,325
No guy here has any story like that.

314
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:55,371
Every woman in here has
at least three stories like that.

315
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,165
I promise you, they do.

316
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,797
Creepy dudes are everywhere, man.

317
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:08,718
They're on the Internet.
Oh, they love the Internet so much!

318
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,262
Such a great showcase for them.

319
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,389
It's really startling
if you look at the difference

320
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,349
between the way
men are treated on the Internet

321
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,785
and women are treated on the Internet.

322
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,104
You know, me as a guy,
let's say I tweet something like,

323
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:22,307
"Hey, guys, I'm doing a show in Phoenix.
Get tickets!"

324
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,276
I might get a mean tweet,
where some guy's like,

325
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,488
"Oh, yeah? I'm never coming to Phoenix,
'cause you suck!

326
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,741
Yeah, I got him.
I did it, yeah!"

327
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,536
If a woman tweets that, though,
her mean tweet will be different.

328
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,620
Like, if a woman tweets,

329
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,180
"Hey, I'm doing a show in Phoenix.
Get tickets!"

330
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,332
Her mean tweet will be like,
"Oh, yeah? Instead of going to Phoenix,

331
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,544
why don't you come to Buffalo
and suck my dick?

332
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,921
Yeah! I got her!
I did it, yeah!

333
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,382
Let's go watch Transformers again! Pshh!"

334
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,595
No women are harassing me like that.
Women just don't harass dudes in that way.

335
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,282
I never get tweets like that.
No women are ever writing me stuff like,

336
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,725
"Oh, hey, Aziz,
I bet you give good head!

337
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,688
Yeah! Suck my pussy, Aziz!
Suck my pussy, Aziz!"

338
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,290
No women are out there
writing me like,

339
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,149
"Oh, hey, Aziz,
I wanna take your head

340
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,319
and squeeze it in between my titties
till your beard pops off. Yeah!"

341
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,862
No women are saying that.

342
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,186
No women are out there like, "Oh, Aziz,
you're putting out a new stand-up special?

343
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,743
Why don't you put your fingers
in my pussy instead?

344
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:18,871
Finger me, Aziz!
Finger me, Aziz!

345
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,790
Let's go watch
Dirty Dancing on Blu-ray!"

346
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,124
Pshh!

347
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,211
No women are saying that 'cause,

348
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,964
in general, women don't
do dumb shit like that.

349
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,799
That's not a thing they do, really.

350
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,219
Men do this shit all the time,
and it's so dumb.

351
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,262
I did a show with
a female comedian once.

352
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,599
She got on stage
and the first thing that happened

353
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:41,060
is some idiot in the front just yells,
"Take it off!"

354
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,981
If you're a dude, never yell,
"Take it off."

355
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:49,401
Unless a woman has placed a tarantula
or a scorpion on one of your shoulders,

356
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,821
there's no reason for you to yell,
"Take it off!"

357
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,365
I've seen dudes yell
"Take it off" in a strip club!

358
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,492
She has a routine planned.

359
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,995
She's trying to tease you,
you dumb motherfucker!

360
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,372
What would you rather her do?

361
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,374
Just, like, walk out there
completely naked?

362
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,054
Another thing...

363
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,348
Another thing creepy dudes do...

364
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,267
they'll just follow women.

365
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,452
You know what I'm talking about?

366
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:25,479
Like, they'll just see a woman
and be like, "Okay!"

367
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,819
And just follow 'em around
for, like, a really long time.

368
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,195
Terrifying.

369
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,739
Raise your hand if you're a woman

370
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,759
and you've ever been
followed around by a creepy dude.

371
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,260
Raise your hand high!
Raise it really fucking high!

372
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,679
Everyone just look around and see
how many hands are raised right now.

373
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:45,207
Yeah, that's way too many people.
That should not be happening.

374
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,291
One woman told me
she eventually got rid of the guy

375
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,922
by walking into a pet store
where you needed to get buzzed in.

376
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,717
I'm not sure why this pet store
had such intense security...

377
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,261
but, um...

378
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,530
she said, she went in there and said,

379
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,407
"Hey, there's a creepy guy following me.
Don't buzz him in."

380
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,432
They're like, "Okay."

381
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,868
And she said she just
waited there until he left.

382
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,369
And I was like,
"Wow, how long did you have to wait?"

383
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,020
And she was like, "Mmm, 45 minutes."

384
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:11,067
Forty-five minutes of her day gone
'cause this creep decided to follow her.

385
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,319
God! But I get it, man,
you gotta be safe.

386
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,713
These guys are crazy.
You never know,

387
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,299
they may follow you to your home
or your apartment where you live.

388
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:21,953
And if you're a creepy dude doing that,
what's your dream scenario at that point?

389
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,620
Like, what's your best-case situation?

390
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,432
Like, what do you think's
really gonna happen?

391
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,017
Like, the woman's
just gonna get to her door

392
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,086
and just turn around,
just like, "So...

393
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,255
are you just gonna stand there...

394
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,925
or are you gonna come up
and fuck me?"

395
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,593
That's never happening.

396
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,511
That's never happening!

397
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,222
There's a greater chance of a tornado

398
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,851
grabbing a woman
and blowing her into your penis

399
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:49,146
than there is of you somehow seducing
a woman that way, you fucking creeps.

400
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,944
What can you do for real, though, man?

401
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,907
One woman told me a story
that was kind of cool.

402
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,032
She said, one time, she had
a creepy guy following her

403
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:03,369
and, uh, she saw another dude
that she thought was like a good dude,

404
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,830
and said, "Hey, can you
pretend to be my boyfriend?

405
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,599
I think there's, like,
a creepy guy following me.

406
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:10,084
Can you pretend to be my boyfriend?"
And the guy did it.

407
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,937
And it helped her out
and the creepy guy went away.

408
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,731
I was like,
"Oh, man, that's really cool," right?

409
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:17,967
She had faith that this other guy
would be a decent human being.

410
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,612
And he was, and he rose to the challenge
and it helped her out, you know?

411
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,476
I would do that.
If any woman in here was like,

412
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,074
"Hey, Aziz, could you pretend
to be my boyfriend?"

413
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,058
I would do that shit,
I would get into it.

414
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:29,561
I'd be like, "I got this!
What's the situation?"

415
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,831
"There's a creepy guy following me."

416
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,648
- "Where is he?"
- "He's right behind us."

417
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,400
"Oh, fuck! He's really creepy.

418
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,193
He's rather large as well.

419
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,088
Are you sure we shouldn't be
seeing other people?

420
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:41,157
Just kidding, I got this."

421
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,342
"What are you gonna do, Aziz?"

422
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,201
"Oh, I'm gonna beat the shit
out of this guy!"

423
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,661
- "Really?"
- "Yeah.

424
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,347
But first, I need to run a quick errand."

425
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,998
- "What is it?"
- "I gotta buy a dog.

426
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,709
Let's go in this pet store
and wait about 45 minutes."

427
00:20:58,174 --> 00:21:01,761
Clap if you're in a relationship
right now. Relationship folks.

428
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:07,099
You know what I love
about relationship people?

429
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:10,102
I love how they tell the story
of how they met their person.

430
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,246
You know what I'm talking about?

431
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,023
It's a very specific type of
storytelling where it's like, "Oh...

432
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,322
...and we've been together ever since."

433
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,490
That's like a fun way
to tell a story, right?

434
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,909
But I don't think it's fair

435
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,745
that frustrated single people can't share
their stories in the same manner, right?

436
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,748
Like, those are more relatable stories.

437
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,836
Like, I would love to hear
a woman tell a story like this,

438
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,856
"So, Rachel's like, 'Come get a drink.
Come get a drink. Come get a drink.'

439
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,107
I'm like,
'No, I'm not coming out tonight.'

440
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,192
She's like, 'You never come out.

441
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,734
How are you gonna meet someone
if you never come out?'

442
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,759
So, I'm like, 'Fine!'

443
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:45,012
So, we go to the bar
and there's this really cute guy.

444
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,139
He's sitting by himself
and he's drinking a whiskey.

445
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,641
And Rachel's like,
'Go talk to him. Go talk to him.'

446
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,036
I'm like,
'No, I'm not saying anything.'

447
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,621
And she's like, 'You go talk to him
or I'm gonna talk to him for you.'

448
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,023
So, I'm like, 'Fine.'
So, I walk over...

449
00:21:57,608 --> 00:22:00,569
and I go,
'Hey, are you waiting on someone?'

450
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,613
And he goes,
'Yeah, I'm waiting on my girlfriend.'

451
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,074
So, I sat back down...

452
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,162
and I haven't seen him ever since!"

453
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:13,415
That's a story
we can all relate to, right?

454
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,779
Or what about a story like this,

455
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,686
"So Bryan's like, 'Come on, man.
Let's go to one more bar.

456
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,813
Let's go to one more spot.'
I'm like,

457
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,147
'I'm pretty beat.
I think I'm just gonna call it.

458
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,548
It's like 3:45 in the morning.
I'm gonna go home.'

459
00:22:21,632 --> 00:22:23,759
He's like, 'No, no, no, no.
This is a late night spot.

460
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,177
There's always girls there.

461
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,389
You never know, you never know,
you never know.'

462
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,515
So, I'm like, 'Fuck it.'

463
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,935
So, we head to the bar and,
uh, it was closed.

464
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,024
Guess it was a slow night,
so, uh, that was that."

465
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,776
Or what about a story like this?

466
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,819
"So, me and her,
we've always been really close,

467
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,256
but, you know,
nothing's ever happened,

468
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,448
never hooked up or anything,
just been friends.

469
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:47,866
And we're out this one night,

470
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:51,954
she's just broken up with her boyfriend
and we're having a couple of drinks,

471
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:53,705
and it starts getting a little flirty.

472
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,832
Then it starts getting
a little touchy-feely.

473
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:59,295
Next thing you know, we're back
at my place and we're having sex.

474
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,049
And this is, like, amazing sex.
It's been, like, pent-up for years.

475
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:05,485
And it's one of those things
that just felt right, you know?

476
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,321
And at one point, she just looks me
right in the eyes and she just says,

477
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,557
'I don't think we should do this!'

478
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,267
So...

479
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,937
I pulled my penis out...

480
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,021
we went to sleep,

481
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:21,442
and it's been
an awkward situation for...

482
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,153
it'll be a year in August."

483
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:28,574
Those are the stories we can relate to.

484
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,331
Being in a relationship, it's tough.
It's a lot of work.

485
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:38,167
But I think being single is even harder,
especially right now.

486
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,378
Very odd, frustrating time
to be a single person.

487
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,797
And I like the idea
of being single in theory.

488
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,881
But what does that mean?

489
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,068
You meet a bunch of different people,

490
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,403
you get to know 'em,
you find someone you really connect with,

491
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,179
hmm, maybe pursue
something more serious.

492
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,139
That sounds good,
I would sign up for that.

493
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,976
But that's not what
being single is anymore, right?

494
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,893
This is what being single is now,

495
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,206
"Hey, it was great meeting you.
We should get together sometime."

496
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,731
"Yeah, that'd be great.
Be in touch."

497
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:01,983
- "All right. Bye."
- "Cool."

498
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,713
"Hey, what's up?
You wanna grab some drinks tonight?"

499
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,548
"Yeah, yeah, I'm with some friends
in this neighborhood."

500
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,841
"Oh, cool.
We'll be down there soon."

501
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,409
- "Can't wait to see you. Cool."
- "All right. Bye."

502
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,621
"Hey, what's up?
We're almost there."

503
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,206
"Shit, we just left."

504
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,500
Why? Why'd you just leave?

505
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,627
Isn't that a rude,
shitty thing to do?

506
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,463
You invited me somewhere
and then you left before I got there.

507
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,899
"Maybe we'll meet up tomorrow."

508
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,860
"Tomorrow is perfect.
Text you later and make a plan."

509
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,677
- "All right. Bye."
- "Cool."

510
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,640
"Hey, what's up?
Should we grab those drinks tonight?"

511
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,351
"Oh, drank way too much last night.
Gonna stay in today."

512
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,978
That's not what was
discussed yesterday!

513
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:42,189
Would you like a transcript
of our conversation?

514
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:44,566
You may scroll up on your phone.

515
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,989
"Maybe we can meet up on Thursday."

516
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,842
"Thursday's perfect.
Text you later and make a plan."

517
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,576
- "All right. Bye."
- "Cool."

518
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:01,083
"Hey, what's up? It's Thursday.
Should we get together tonight?"

519
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,754
And that's what being single is now.

520
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,676
All that garbage.

521
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,511
That's what it is a lot of times.

522
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:18,475
It's pretty much like you're a secretary
for this really shoddy organization...

523
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,104
trying to schedule the dumbest shit
with the flakiest people.

524
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,149
And I've realized this flakiness,

525
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,834
it doesn't even have to do
with dating or anything.

526
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,445
It's actually a symptom
of a bigger problem we all have.

527
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,781
You know, we're all part of the rudest,
flakiest group of people ever.

528
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,367
Like, if you're alive right now
and you have a phone,

529
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,578
you're a rude, shitty person.
You just are.

530
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,723
Like, has anyone here tried to make plans
with anyone in the past couple of years?

531
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,059
Has anyone tried
to make plans with anyone?

532
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:44,042
It's the most frustrating experience.

533
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,421
'Cause what happens anytime you ask
someone to do something nowadays?

534
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,424
It's like,
"Hey, you wanna do this fun thing?"

535
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:54,386
"Maybe. Maybe, I could try.
We could see about...

536
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,764
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe,
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe."

537
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,851
No one wants to commit to shit.

538
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:03,854
'Cause they're terrified that
something better is gonna come along.

539
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,772
It is so rude.
Why do we do this?

540
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:08,609
I think it's 'cause we're also part
of the least lonely generation,

541
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:10,694
the least isolated generation, you know?

542
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:14,072
It used to be a big deal when you finally
got to see your friends in person, right?

543
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,366
Nowadays, it's not as much,

544
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,202
'cause you're always connected
with your friends, you're always--

545
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,804
Wherever you are, work,
school, whatever,

546
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,708
you're always texting,
e-mailing, joking around.

547
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,642
So, when you see them in person,
it's not as big a deal as it used to be.

548
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,936
You know, now it's like,
"Oh, man, it's so good to see you.

549
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,400
I just went on this crazy vacation!"

550
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:30,881
"I know, I saw all the pictures.
Leave me alone."

551
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,008
It used to not be like that.

552
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,320
It used to be a big deal
when you saw your friends, right?

553
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:38,305
Think about what you'd be doing,
like, 40 years ago, you know.

554
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,449
Think about what that would be like.

555
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:41,350
What you'd be doing, like,
on a Thursday night.

556
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,977
You know, you're just sitting
in your house, by yourself...

557
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,646
you're in a wooden chair...

558
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,150
eating a can of beans.

559
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,442
You have nothing.

560
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,487
You're not connected to anyone.
No entertainment.

561
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,364
"Oh, uh, maybe I'll listen to some music."

562
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,158
All right, just the music you own,

563
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:00,202
or you can sit around and hope
a song you like comes on the radio,

564
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,567
and then grab a cassette
and run over like a little bitch.

565
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,584
"Oh, I missed the beginning!"

566
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,297
Maybe you'll stay in
and watch a movie.

567
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,524
All right, what's it gonna be?

568
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:14,633
Home Alone, Jurassic Park
or Mrs. Doubtfire?

569
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:17,969
That's all you have.
You have nothing!

570
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,682
And then,
in the corner of the room,

571
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,975
you have your one outlet
to the outside world, right?

572
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,060
Your landline.

573
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,580
And if you were lucky, at some point
it would ring and you'd be like,

574
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:31,608
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

575
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:34,110
Hello!

576
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,197
Who is this?

577
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,449
Phil, thank you
so much for calling.

578
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,867
What would you like to do?

579
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:43,119
That sounds great!
I'll see you there at 8:00."

580
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,789
And you would be there at 8:00.

581
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:50,211
And Phil would be there at 8:00.

582
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,128
And if Phil wasn't there by 8:15,

583
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:55,466
you'd be like,
"Oh, my God! Phil is dead.

584
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,801
Phil has died!

585
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:01,555
We were supposed to see
Police Academy and now he's dead!"

586
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,535
'Cause that was the only polite way
to cancel on people back in the day.

587
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,603
You had to die.

588
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,396
Now what do your shitty friends do?

589
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,147
They'll call you like an hour before.

590
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,942
"Hey, you know,
I'm feeling kind of tired.

591
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,445
So, I think I'm just
gonna stay in tonight."

592
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,946
"Oh, you're tired?

593
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,115
What, were you doing
a bunch of manual labor?

594
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:23,201
Were you, uh, building a habitat
for humanity? Or..."

595
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:25,912
"No, I just did
one of those online surveys

596
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:29,082
that tells you what character you are
from a particular TV show.

597
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,836
And I've done, like, seven of them,
so I'm feeling kind of tired.

598
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,919
And, you know, I'm just so tired,
I don't feel like driving and everything."

599
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,217
Hold up!
You're too tired to drive?

600
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,136
The car moves.
You don't do shit, you just sit there.

601
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,804
How is this a valid excuse?

602
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,682
Did you recently purchase
a Flintstones -type vehicle

603
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,183
where you need to run along?

604
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,353
I don't believe you did.

605
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,774
So now, when you make plans,

606
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,585
you got to remember
how flaky everyone is, right?

607
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,902
You got to factor that in.

608
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,570
You got to change your approach.

609
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:00,215
You know, you look
at my phone on a Sunday,

610
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,758
when I'm trying to find
someone to get brunch with,

611
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,382
I look like a psychopath.
It's just like,

612
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,969
"Hey, you wanna get brunch?
Hey, you wanna get--

613
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,704
Hey, you wanna-- Hey, you wanna--
Hey, you wanna-- Hey, you wanna--"

614
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:10,123
And it's this weird list
of my best friend

615
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,544
to the shittiest person
I'd eat pancakes with.

616
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,170
But I get it.

617
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,173
I get it, man.
I understand why we're like this.

618
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:21,134
We all have the same nightmare.
You know the nightmare.

619
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,054
The nightmare is you do commit
to doing the thing with Phil, right?

620
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,449
And you get there, like,
"This is fun, Phil. I'm glad I came.

621
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,475
We're getting to catch up and stuff.
It's good."

622
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,935
Then you get that phone call.

623
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,314
"Dude, where are you?
Biggie and Tupac faked their deaths.

624
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,775
They're doing a show right now.
I have an extra ticket. Where are you?"

625
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,947
"I'm upstate picking apples with Phil!"

626
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,285
We all have that nightmare,

627
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:51,039
and I do think there's a new thing,
where we always want the best, you know?

628
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,417
Whatever we're doing,
we wanna do the best, funnest thing.

629
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,168
Whatever we're buying,
we want the best.

630
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,837
We have all these options,

631
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,799
and we have all this information
at our fingertips to research it.

632
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,884
And we always want the best.
Why not have the best?

633
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,648
And a lot of times
it's very useful, right?

634
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,972
I made some more
educated decisions in my life.

635
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:10,309
But, at a certain point,
doesn't that stuff become debilitating?

636
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:11,703
Like, now it's gotten to the point

637
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:14,480
where before I make
any choice or decision in my life,

638
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:18,233
I have to google something
to make sure I'm not fucking it up.

639
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,318
You know what I mean?

640
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,528
Like, the other day,
I had to get a toothbrush.

641
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,048
Before I left my house,
without even thinking about it, I googled,

642
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,825
"Best toothbrush."

643
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,412
That's right, I'm about to get
the best toothbrush.

644
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,414
Why? Why do I need
the best toothbrush?

645
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,041
Every other toothbrush
I bought on a hunch has been fine.

646
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,877
Like, what is the big fear now?

647
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,212
Have you ever run
into someone with no teeth,

648
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,547
and be like,
"What happened?"

649
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:45,176
"Bought the wrong toothbrush.
Should've done more research!"

650
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,265
And when you take
these kind of mentalities

651
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,744
and you throw 'em in the dating world,
things get crazy, man.

652
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,436
Things get really weird, you know.

653
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,897
You people that are married,
been in long relationships,

654
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,190
you have no idea
what it's like out there right now.

655
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,609
Everything has changed.

656
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,778
Take your most basic problem
as a single person.

657
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,071
What is it? You like someone,
they don't like you back.

658
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,908
Or the reverse, someone likes you,
you don't like them back.

659
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,036
Okay, at one point in time,
that used to be kind of a weird thing.

660
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,871
It was awkward,
it was a conversation,

661
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,714
it was something
you had to deal with, right?

662
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,583
Now, what do people do?

663
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,894
Someone likes you,
you don't like 'em back?

664
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:22,381
Just pretend to be busy forever.

665
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:25,759
That's what people do now.
They pretend to be busy forever,

666
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,637
and then they conduct this
strange psychological experiment,

667
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,473
where it's like, "Mmm, how much
hope does this person have?

668
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:35,394
How many times do I need to pretend
to be busy before they realize

669
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:39,898
this many scheduling conflicts
is statistically impossible...

670
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,443
and something else is going on?"

671
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,421
Now, look, I don't think
it's coming from a bad place.

672
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,589
I think you're trying not to hurt
someone's feelings, right?

673
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,715
What are your other options?

674
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,867
Um, you could say nothing
and give people silence.

675
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:53,888
Or you could just be honest with them.
Those are your big three options, right?

676
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,290
Clap if what you do is pretend to be busy.
Clap if that's your move.

677
00:31:58,584 --> 00:31:59,793
Okay.

678
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,712
I'd say that's my move as well, okay.

679
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:05,256
Clap if what you do is, you say nothing.
You give people silence.

680
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:11,012
Okay, and finally,
clap if you're just honest with people.

681
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,100
Okay, now let's say
the situation is reversed

682
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:16,536
and someone else is dealing with you.

683
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,395
How do you prefer
they handle the situation?

684
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,816
Clap if you prefer
that they pretend to be busy.

685
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,115
All right.

686
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:34,410
Clap if you prefer that they say nothing,
that they give you silence.

687
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,290
Why the fuck would you prefer that?

688
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,793
This is a hypothetical thing.

689
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:45,213
That's your preference?
You're into confusion?

690
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,007
Sorry, this isn't
a good way to do polls.

691
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,426
I shouldn't shit on people
after certain responses.

692
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:52,387
I apologize.

693
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,767
And finally, clap if you prefer
that they're just honest with you.

694
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,979
I'd say I'm in that camp as well.

695
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:04,399
Well, well, well, I think
our findings are pretty clear, right?

696
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,943
We're all really shitty people.

697
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,738
Whenever we're dealing with others,

698
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,258
we're like, "I'm gonna pretend to be busy.
I don't wanna say anything."

699
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,718
When other people are dealing
with us, we're like,

700
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,912
"Why must we all play these games?

701
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:21,041
Can't we all just be
honest with one another?"

702
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,086
And the other thing is, we all say
we prefer honesty, myself included,

703
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,172
but can we really handle honesty,
you know?

704
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,901
I talked to a woman once, she's like,
"Oh, I'm just honest with people.

705
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,360
I don't mess around.
I'm just honest with people."

706
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,487
I was like, "Really? All right.

707
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,738
I'm a guy, I ask you out for dinner,

708
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,197
you don't wanna go,
what would you say?"

709
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,784
She said, "I would say, 'I'm not
interested in getting dinner with you.'"

710
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,410
And on one hand,
that's really nice, right?

711
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,674
There's no games there,
you know exactly where you stand,

712
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:42,888
you're not wasting your time.

713
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,439
On the other hand, though,

714
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,400
could you imagine
actually receiving a text like that?

715
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,235
"Hey, you wanna get dinner sometime?"

716
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,838
"I'm not interested in getting
dinner with you."

717
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,364
God damn!
What are you, a demon?

718
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,785
That's the meanest, coldest shit
anyone's ever said to me, okay?

719
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,829
I'm a person.
I have feelings, okay?

720
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,205
I'm just a fellow human being

721
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,809
that wanted to break bread with you
and get to know you a little better.

722
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,751
Is that such a horrifying situation?

723
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:07,378
I was basically like,
"Hey, you want some free food?"

724
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:10,381
You're like,
"Not if your presence is involved.

725
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,509
You got a gift certificate?
I'll go with my friend."

726
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,658
I don't know what the best way
to deal with it is, man.

727
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:19,725
I do think it's tough.

728
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:21,852
I do think silence
might be the worst, though.

729
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:26,565
Silence to me seems like the rudest,
most cowardly way to handle a situation.

730
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,918
And it's also the one that hurts
the other person the most, right?

731
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:31,422
We've all been on the other end of that.
That's the worst, man.

732
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,364
The worst is when you meet
someone you're really into

733
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,634
and you feel that connection.
You know what I'm talking about?

734
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:40,161
When you meet that person...
"Oh, my God. We both felt that.

735
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:43,164
No games this time, deep connection.

736
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,376
No games, deep connection.

737
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,919
No games...

738
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,965
deep connection."

739
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,735
You send the first text,
you're all confidence.

740
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:56,011
"Forget about it, it's done.

741
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,014
Wrap it up, put it in a bag,
write my name on it...

742
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,557
'cause it's done."

743
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,685
Twenty minutes later,
no response.

744
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,205
"Okay, well, I'm sure she's just
busy with a couple of things,

745
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,563
and any minute now..."

746
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,525
Three hours later, "Fuck!

747
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,194
I put too many
exclamation points in my text!

748
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,487
What was I thinking?

749
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,716
I should have said 'Hey'
with two 'Y's, ' not three 'Y's.'

750
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,992
I'm so stupid!"

751
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,576
Three hours earlier.

752
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:24,080
You're looking up
vacation packages on Orbitz,

753
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:27,292
you're planning birthdays,
holidays, a whole life together.

754
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,295
And now it's all gone away,
and you have no idea why.

755
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:34,174
And this is when people
start going crazy.

756
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,568
'Cause in the past,
let's say you're in a situation like this,

757
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:39,638
someone doesn't call or write you back,
you get over it with time, right?

758
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,723
Out of sight, out of mind.

759
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:42,974
The problem now is,

760
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:46,519
we don't give ourselves the luxury
of out of sight, out of mind.

761
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,272
'Cause what happens now when
you get into one of these situations?

762
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,650
We all become detectives.
We start opening up tabs:

763
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,901
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

764
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,504
"All right, let's see every single thing
this motherfucker's doing

765
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,113
instead of texting me back.

766
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:58,448
GPS on screen two!

767
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,574
Instagram on screen three!

768
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,535
Let's see what
they're looking at right now!"

769
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,539
And it's a brutal thing
to do to yourself.

770
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,708
You should not do it

771
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,794
because, ah, you're in the most
vulnerable position, right?

772
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,754
You put yourself out there.
You're like...

773
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,132
♪ I like you, baby
You like me ♪

774
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,221
Any guy or girl in that situation,
that's what they're feeling.

775
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:25,391
And you're just waiting
for something to put your heart at ease,

776
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,602
but instead,
you're getting nothing.

777
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,246
Then you go on the Internet,
you're reading stuff like,

778
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,522
"Mmm, eating ice cream
and watching Dexter.

779
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,191
Hash mark, I really need a man."

780
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,819
"What? I just asked you out!

781
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,362
You know I follow you!

782
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,822
You know I'm reading this.

783
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,199
What kind of evil is inside of you?"

784
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,161
And it seems like an area

785
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:47,789
where we could all be
a little bit more thoughtful, right?

786
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:50,541
Uh, 'cause, look,
anytime someone asks you out,

787
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,437
whether it's a guy asking a girl or girl
asking a guy, whatever the scenario,

788
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,006
that person is paying you
a huge compliment, right?

789
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,132
They're basically saying,

790
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,593
"Hey, out of the infinite number of things
I could do with my time,

791
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,279
what I'd like to do is spend
some time with you,

792
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,823
'cause I think there's
something special about you,

793
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:06,826
and I'd like to get to know you better
and see if there's a connection there."

794
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,684
That's a very nice thing
for someone to say,

795
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,521
I feel like you should
respect that a little bit.

796
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,774
So, maybe don't post your
dumb photos and stuff up.

797
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:16,401
Like, you wouldn't treat people
that way 20, 30 years ago.

798
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,403
Twenty, 30 years ago,
if someone asked you out

799
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,566
and you weren't interested,

800
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,923
you wouldn't send
a package to their house,

801
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:24,409
"Here's some photos of me
and my friends at the beach.

802
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,162
Here's a photo of a puppy
I saw on the street.

803
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,806
Here's a bunch of photos
of me and some other guy.

804
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,873
Am I fucking him?

805
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:33,084
Maybe. Why don't you think
about that for a few hours?"

806
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,923
So, that's it, man.

807
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,340
Anyone here that's single,

808
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,302
they have some version of that
nonsense in their phone, right?

809
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,680
Clap if you're single and you met
someone in the past few days,

810
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,224
past week or so,
and you've been texting back and forth.

811
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,869
Clap if that's your situation.
Clap right now.

812
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,686
Okay...

813
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,939
If you're in that situation,
do me a favor right now.

814
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,523
Pull out your phone

815
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:59,485
and scroll to the very, very first message
that you have with this person.

816
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,947
And when you get to
the very, very, very first message,

817
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,258
come on to the front stage over here
through this aisle here.

818
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,617
So, go ahead,
pull out your phone,

819
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,221
scroll to the very first message,
when you get to the first message,

820
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,723
come to the front, right here,
in front of this gentleman here.

821
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,374
Miss, you at the top message?
Yeah?

822
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,002
All right, so how long ago
did you meet this person?

823
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,295
Uh, September 2nd.

824
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,006
September 2nd.
Okay, so let's see what happened, okay?

825
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:24,469
So... he sends the first message.

826
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:28,306
He sends it Tuesday,
September 2nd at 11:26 p.m.

827
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,560
Odd time to send a first message.

828
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:40,235
He says,
"Hey, Ashley, dot-dot-dot, it's Chris."

829
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,444
He said his last name,

830
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,906
but I don't wanna repeat it
in case he gets murdered.

831
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,534
"Hey, Ashley, dot-dot-dot."

832
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,338
I like that, "dot-dot-dot."
"Hey, Ashley..."

833
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,543
"It's Chris.
It was nice to hang-- It was--"

834
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,337
It started so smooth.

835
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,214
"Hey, Ashley,
dot-dot-dot, it's Chris."

836
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,508
And then he goes,
"It was nice to hanging with you..."

837
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,303
Chris, no! Proofread!

838
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:12,475
"It was nice to--" His voice changes
for the rest of the bit now, after that.

839
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,989
Earlier, it was,
"Hey, Ashley, it's Chris."

840
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,147
Now it's,
"Hey, Ashley, it's Chris.

841
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,441
It was nice to hanging with you at BM.

842
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,694
Hope you're recovering well.
Let's grab a coffee sometime."

843
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,407
And then, you send
a text back the next day

844
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,742
at 1:05 p.m.
You say,

845
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,411
"Hey, exclamation.

846
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:35,206
Glad you made it out alive.
Headed to Soho House with Erica now.

847
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,501
I'm also around after 6:00 tomorrow
or in the afternoon Friday."

848
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:40,879
Whoa! You must really like this guy!

849
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,923
Who the fuck...

850
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,886
Who the fuck opens up
their schedule that much?

851
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,772
If the Dalai Lama was like, "I really
wanna get tea with you sometime, Aziz,"

852
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,984
I'd be like, "Uh, let's just check in
next week, Dalai Lama."

853
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:07,155
And so, then he sends a message

854
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,200
Thursday at 11:55 a.m.
and he goes,

855
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,827
"I thought I'd see you
at Marquee last night."

856
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:15,496
And then, he tries to send...

857
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,498
Sorry, all these places
sound kind of douche-y.

858
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,292
I'm really sorry.

859
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,377
No judgments here, but...

860
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:28,218
It's not like, "I thought I'd see you
at that MoMA exhibit."

861
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:31,887
It's like, "Why weren't you at the club?
There was a foam party!"

862
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,894
And then... you guys text
back and forth, you get the coffee.

863
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,813
Did you guys get the coffee?

864
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,124
- Uh, yeah.
- And how was the coffee?

865
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,459
- Did you have fun?
- It was okay.

866
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,484
Yeah? It was okay?

867
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,362
All right, so let's see where
things are right now, okay?

868
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,907
Yesterday, 9:44 p.m.

869
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,996
"So, what did we miss
at Marquee last night?"

870
00:40:57,998 --> 00:41:01,251
God damn it, Ashley,
go to some better places.

871
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,628
Quit wasting your life
in these shitty clubs.

872
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,298
No, no, no, it's fine.

873
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,512
And then he says,
"Is that what you're up to tonight?"

874
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:16,807
And then you say, "I'm on my way
to the Aziz show at MSG."

875
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:25,858
And he goes, "Oh, okay,
dot-dot-dot. Enjoy."

876
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:31,197
Ashley, I think I speak
for everyone here when I say,

877
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,074
"Fuck this guy."

878
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:40,748
Thank you very much for
sharing that with us, Ashley.

879
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,000
So, that's it, man.

880
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,045
That's what everyone
has to deal with now.

881
00:41:45,128 --> 00:41:49,549
When they meet someone,
they have to engage in that kind of stuff.

882
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,467
And I was in that world for a long time.

883
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:55,263
And it can be fun,
but it can get frustrating.

884
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,141
And now I'm in a different world,
now I'm in a relationship,

885
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,392
and the rela--

886
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,936
Don't do that shit.
Don't clap.

887
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,106
That is so rude
to all the single people here.

888
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:07,918
I used to do stand-up
where I said I was single,

889
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:09,902
no one ever clapped,
no one said shit.

890
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:14,782
No one was like, "Get it, Aziz!
Fuck everybody! Now is your time!"

891
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,367
Both things are very fun.

892
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,137
It's fun being single,
it's fun being in a relationship.

893
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,370
They're both fun, all right?

894
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,058
But I'm in the relationship right now
and the relationship's going great.

895
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:25,043
But it's also fairly new,
it's about a year and a few months.

896
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,188
I feel like whenever you talk to people
in longer relationships,

897
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:28,355
they're always like,
"Oh, my God.

898
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,465
Those first few years
are such a magical time.

899
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,508
You have to enjoy that,
it's so amazing."

900
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,053
And it's weird being
in the magical zone,

901
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:38,223
and knowing that the magic
is gonna change soon.

902
00:42:38,306 --> 00:42:40,492
You know what I mean?
Like, right now, things are crazy.

903
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:42,102
Like, right now, um, you know,

904
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:44,895
last time I was in New York,
there was a bad snowstorm,

905
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,982
and I stepped in this huge puddle
of sludge and my foot got soaked.

906
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:50,443
And the first thing I did
was I sent her a text.

907
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,946
I said, "You know
how you feel days like today,

908
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,575
when you step in a puddle of sludge
and your foot gets soaked?

909
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,620
Every second with you,
it feels like the pure opposite of that."

910
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:01,704
Aw!

911
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:03,390
And yes, that's a little
cheesy or whatever,

912
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,976
but I'm just sharing that so you know,
that's where my heart is, right?

913
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,962
But what's weird is knowing that
that text will eventually change, right?

914
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,816
Like, people in long relationships,
doesn't that text eventually change?

915
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,151
Doesn't that text
eventually become like,

916
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,511
"Fuck! I stepped in some sludge.

917
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,223
Do we have to get dinner
with your friends?

918
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,475
Can you tell them I died
in a hovercraft accident?

919
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,018
I never wanna see 'em again.

920
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,662
Why do we always
hang out with my friends?

921
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,064
'Cause they're better people!"

922
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:34,820
But I hope we're able to maintain
some version of that love as things go on,

923
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:36,406
'cause it's an amazing thing.

924
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,134
It's so beautiful
to get messages like that.

925
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:41,744
She sent me a message one time,
she said, "You feel like home to me.

926
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:45,456
Even if we're in a hotel or something,
I feel like I'm home, 'cause I'm with you.

927
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,751
And when I wake up and I see your face,
I remember that I'm home.

928
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,337
That's one of the reasons
I love you so much."

929
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,717
She sent me that when I went away
for five minutes to take a shit.

930
00:43:56,801 --> 00:43:59,429
You realize how awesome
it is to be shitting

931
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,222
and to read a message like that?

932
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:04,309
It was like waste was leaving my body
and love was coming in.

933
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:08,020
It was... an amazing feeling.

934
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,401
Did you guys know there's actually
two different types of love?

935
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,171
There is, it's true.
There's two different types of love.

936
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,238
There's passionate love
and companion love.

937
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,325
Passionate love is like the crazy love
you feel when you first meet someone

938
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:23,118
and you're going crazy,
you're just like, "Ahh!"

939
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,455
But that eventually calms down
into something different

940
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:26,747
called companion love,

941
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:30,293
which is not worse,
it's just different, less intense.

942
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,712
And, you know,
it's kind of a bummer, but I get it.

943
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,481
I understand why we have
the two different types of love.

944
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,625
You couldn't just have
the crazy love your whole life,

945
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,884
'cause then society
wouldn't function, right?

946
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,528
We'd all just be in our homes,
just staring at each other like...

947
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,141
And the streets would just be filled
with homeless children eating garbage,

948
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,603
riding large animals. I get it.

949
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,164
So that's why we have
two different types of love.

950
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,666
But when I first heard
about that, I was like,

951
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,168
"Wouldn't it be interesting to just have
the crazy stuff for a while?

952
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,236
What would that be like?"

953
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,113
Maybe, instead of having
one long relationship,

954
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,115
you have a bunch of
shorter relationships.

955
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,075
Your graph of love and happiness
is just like,

956
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,620
boom, boom, boom!

957
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,705
But, you know,
I don't think you can do that graph.

958
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,434
I've tried to do that graph,
I've seen friends try to do that graph.

959
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:12,335
And, yes, it can be
a lot of fun for a while,

960
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,295
but eventually
that graph gets weird.

961
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:16,232
You know, eventually that graph
becomes something like this.

962
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:19,384
You know, it's like, "Oh, shit!
Me and the boys, we're going out tonight.

963
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:21,719
This bar's gonna be crazy.
This bar's gonna be crazy.

964
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,614
This bar's gonna be crazy.
This bar's gonna be crazy.

965
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,156
This bar's gonna be crazy.
This bar's gonna be crazy.

966
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,700
Oh, my God,
there's so many hot girls here.

967
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,810
Yeah, this one girl is really into me.
Yeah, we're going home together.

968
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,271
Yeah, we're having sex.

969
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:33,398
Yeah, I'm coming!
I'm coming! I'm coming!

970
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:37,902
I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!
I'm coming! I'm coming! I came!

971
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,005
This feels empty, this feels empty,
this feels empty.

972
00:45:40,029 --> 00:45:41,632
I gotta get out of here!
I gotta get out of here!

973
00:45:41,656 --> 00:45:43,866
This feels empty, this feels empty,
this feels empty.

974
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,452
Okay, okay, okay!
I got out of there. I got out of there.

975
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,872
I just got some brunch.
I just got some brunch.

976
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:52,667
I'm drinking some water,
I'm drinking some coconut water.

977
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,168
I'm getting hydrated.

978
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,604
That's right, I'm getting hydrated.

979
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,463
I'm ready to run it back!
That's right!

980
00:45:57,547 --> 00:45:59,799
Night two, me and the boys,
we're going out tonight!

981
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:01,360
This bar's gonna be crazy.
This bar's gonna be crazy.

982
00:46:01,384 --> 00:46:02,424
This bar's gonna be crazy.

983
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,820
This bar's gonna be crazy.
This bar's gonna be--

984
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,138
Okay, no one's really out tonight.
Okay, so, uh...

985
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,599
More of a low-key type situation.

986
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,561
Okay, me and the boys will just
get drunk by ourselves. No shame there.

987
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:14,314
Okay, it's getting little bit weird, uh...

988
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,523
We'll just get some tacos.

989
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,400
Tacos are delicious."

990
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:18,585
You wake up the next morning,

991
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,321
"Oh, my God! Why did I eat
three quesadillas then a bowl of cereal?

992
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:23,030
That was really unnecessary.

993
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:24,490
Okay, well...

994
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:27,660
I'm just gonna go back to bed.
I feel like garbage, and uh...

995
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,788
God, you know, this is fun, hooking up
with these hot girls or whatever,

996
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,374
but frankly, I wish...

997
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:37,337
I just had someone I really cared about,
that I could hold.

998
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,880
But I don't have that person, so...

999
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,550
I'm just gonna jerk off and go to bed."

1000
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:52,352
So now, I'm trying the relationship graph.

1001
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:55,396
But the relationship graph
is fucked up too.

1002
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,649
Like, if you take the traditional
definition of a successful relationship,

1003
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,002
and you put it in that graph,
that graph is fucked up too.

1004
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,278
This is that graph, okay?

1005
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:04,447
You meet the person...

1006
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,824
"Oh, my God,
all these experiences are amazing!

1007
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,302
All these experiences are amazing!
All these experiences are amazing!

1008
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:11,412
All these experiences are amazing!
All these-- Okay.

1009
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,723
Some of the experiences
are getting repetitive.

1010
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:14,015
Some of the experiences
are getting repetitive.

1011
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,642
But you know what?
I love this person so much.

1012
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,668
We're getting married!
Yeah! We're getting married!

1013
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:19,480
Oh, my God, we have a wedding!
All our friends came!

1014
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,213
This is so fun!
I can't believe it!

1015
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,883
I'm a husband. I have a wife.
Oh, my God, this is the great--

1016
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,236
Oh, my God, we just had a kid!
Oh, my God, we just had a kid!

1017
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,279
Oh, my God, we just had a kid!
Oh, my God, we just had a kid!

1018
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:29,639
Oh, my God, this is so hard!

1019
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,825
Oh, my God, this is the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

1020
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,976
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Okay, okay, okay!

1021
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,187
The kid's walking around and talking
and saying stuff. This is amazing.

1022
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:41,233
I've never felt so proud
of anything in my entire life.

1023
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:44,654
Oh, my God, we just had another kid!
Oh, my God, we just had another kid!

1024
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:47,657
Why did we stop using the birth control?
That was so stupid!

1025
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,242
And why did we think it would
be easier the second time around?

1026
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,786
This is not analogous at all!

1027
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,664
There is now two goddamn people
at the same goddamn time!

1028
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:55,873
It's so much harder!

1029
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,059
We gotta-- Oh, my God,
we gotta pay for all the stuff!

1030
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,502
How does anyone afford children?

1031
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,187
We gotta get them into
a good kindergarten.

1032
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,923
What the fuck's a good kindergarten?
They just sing songs!

1033
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,633
Who is fucking that up?

1034
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,969
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
we got them into the good kindergarten.

1035
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,781
We got them into the good kindergarten.
We got them in.

1036
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:11,865
Now they're in elementary school.

1037
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,742
They're drawing pictures and stuff,
this is pretty cool.

1038
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,086
Okay, now they're in adolescence.

1039
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,770
Oh, these kids are fucking pricks!
I fucking hate these kids!

1040
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,939
I want them to die!
I want them to die!

1041
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,691
I want my whole family to die!

1042
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,108
I don't really want them to die.

1043
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,670
I just wanna feel
what it would feel like

1044
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:26,779
to murder every single person
I live with.

1045
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,906
Okay, I can't do that.
I can't do that.

1046
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,884
Okay, now they're in high school.
They're in high school now.

1047
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:32,719
This is good, they're in high school,
a little bit older.

1048
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,054
I can hang out with them.
Oh, God.

1049
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:36,718
One of the kids might be having sex.
Yeah, he might be doing drugs.

1050
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,584
I gotta put spyware on his phone
to make sure he's not messing around.

1051
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:40,668
This is my life now.

1052
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,353
I gotta read this mess
whenever I get home from work.

1053
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,564
'Hey, what's going on?'
'Nothing.

1054
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,566
You wanna come hang out later?'
'Maybe.' 'All right.' 'Well--'

1055
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,569
Will you fucking buy some weed already
so I can justify this use of my time?

1056
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:51,011
Okay, okay!
One of the kids is going to college.

1057
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,347
He's gone, he's gone.
Oh, shit, the other kid's gone.

1058
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,742
They're both gone.
It's just us in the house together again.

1059
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,560
We're spending time together again.

1060
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,563
We've refound our passionate love!

1061
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,483
Finally, we can travel the world!

1062
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:06,068
I'm too tired to travel the world.

1063
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,713
Let's just take it easy.
Let's just take it easy.

1064
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,697
Let's just take it easy in the house.
It's fine.

1065
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,382
We got the house to ourselves.
This is good.

1066
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,784
You know, it's okay.
It's kind of boring, but it's good.

1067
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,911
We don't have to work and stuff.
It's okay.

1068
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,306
It's fine, the kids come to visit
every now and then, it's okay.

1069
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,457
Okay. Oh, God.
Oh, God, my wife is sick.

1070
00:49:20,541 --> 00:49:24,044
Oh, no, my wife's sick.
Oh, no, my wife just passed.

1071
00:49:24,128 --> 00:49:27,172
Oh, God, I'm all by myself.
I'm so alone.

1072
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,842
Oh, God, I'm sick now too.
I'm sick now too.

1073
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,302
I can't even walk.
I can't even walk.

1074
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,806
I've walked my entire life,
and now I can't even walk.

1075
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,728
But now I get to get
one of those Rascal scooters!

1076
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,772
I'm gonna drive that
motherfucker everywhere!"

1077
00:49:42,855 --> 00:49:44,732
New York, thank you so much!

1078
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:12,176
Thank you again for coming out,
I really do appreciate it.

1079
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:18,015
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1080
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,618
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

1081
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:22,144
You guys can sit down.
Thank you so much.

1082
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,979
Um, serious question here.

1083
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,356
Has anyone here ever seen a ghost?

1084
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,482
I love ghost stories.

1085
00:50:27,567 --> 00:50:30,277
Someone once told me and my girlfriend
this really scary ghost story

1086
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,196
about a little boy.

1087
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:36,325
And it was so scary,
and she gets really scared of ghosts.

1088
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,453
So, I started doing this thing where
every now and then we're asleep,

1089
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:42,057
I'll just wake her up in the middle
of the night and I'll just be like,

1090
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,625
"Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, boo...

1091
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:47,377
what's that little boy
doing over there?"

1092
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,965
And she hates it!

1093
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,758
And I love it!

1094
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:55,720
And I do it all the time.

1095
00:50:55,803 --> 00:50:57,972
What I'd really like to do, though,
one day, is...

1096
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,199
And this is like something...

1097
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,684
I don't know if it might be
too messed up to do, but, um...

1098
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:03,912
She's, like, the nicest,
sweetest person.

1099
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:05,747
Anytime I need a drink
in the middle of the night,

1100
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,040
she's always like,
"Oh, I'll go down and get it."

1101
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,499
I'm always like,
"No, no, it's fine. I'll get it."

1102
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:11,611
But what if, one night, I was like,
"Yeah, can you go down and get it?"

1103
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:16,991
And then she goes downstairs,
and there, unbeknownst to her...

1104
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,368
I've hired a little boy.

1105
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,248
And he's wearing, like,
old-timey clothes.

1106
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,977
And as soon as she gets downstairs,
he's just like,

1107
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:29,586
"Mommy, where have you been?"

1108
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,298
I wanna do it so bad!

1109
00:51:33,382 --> 00:51:34,842
But I can't.

1110
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,012
I've thought it through,
there's three reasons why I can't do it.

1111
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,198
One, I would never wanna
scare anyone that bad, right?

1112
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,807
That's a terrifying thing.

1113
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,186
Two, if I did pull it off,

1114
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,980
I'd live in eternal fear

1115
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,358
over what the fuck she was gonna
do to get back at me.

1116
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,820
'Cause I'm pretty sure
she's not gonna let that one slide.

1117
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:58,265
And three, this is probably
the biggest reason not to do it,

1118
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,784
she would murder the little boy.

1119
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:03,162
Like, the little boy's dead.

1120
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,789
So, I don't think I can do it.

1121
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,584
I'm a good boyfriend, though.

1122
00:52:09,669 --> 00:52:12,589
She's never really been upset with me
about anything, that I can think of.

1123
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:14,607
The only time I remember
she was kind of mad was once,

1124
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,009
when I was flying from
New York to New Zealand.

1125
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,178
I was gonna be gone for a while
to go to a wedding.

1126
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,990
I was calling her when I was on the plane
to talk to her before we took off,

1127
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,367
and I got her voicemail, so I texted her.
I was, like, "Hey, it's me.

1128
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,271
Just wanted to talk
before the flight took off."

1129
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:30,230
And she texts me back and says,
"I called you four hours ago."

1130
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:31,565
And I could tell she was upset,

1131
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,818
'cause she also included

1132
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:37,738
the emoji of the Indian guy
with the gun beside his head.

1133
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,660
This tipped me off.

1134
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,723
So I called her back and I was like,
"What's up with that?

1135
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,267
Why you gotta say that?
What did I do?"

1136
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,685
She's like,
"I called you four hours ago."

1137
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:51,919
I was like, "I know.
I was busy packing and everything.

1138
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,379
I knew I'd have time to call you
when I got on the plane.

1139
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:55,630
That's why I waited."

1140
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:58,508
She's like, "Oh, you were busy?
You were busy.

1141
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,512
Well, I looked on
your friend's Instagram

1142
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,014
and he posted a photo of you

1143
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,641
hanging out by the pool,
snapping Polaroids.

1144
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:10,020
So, I feel like, if you have time
to hang out by the pool

1145
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:14,524
and play with your Polaroid camera,
I think you have time to call me back."

1146
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,986
And I was like, "Okay, I'm sorry."

1147
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,403
Cut to a week later.

1148
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:22,199
It's Valentine's Day,
I've done all this romantic stuff,

1149
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,369
and it's time for us
to exchange gifts.

1150
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:30,124
I have her gift, it's all wrapped up,
and I'm just like, uh...

1151
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:34,253
"So, hey, remember, like,
a week ago, you were upset that...

1152
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,576
I didn't call you back and
I was hanging out by the pool,

1153
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,632
playing with a Polaroid camera?

1154
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:40,885
Well, the reason I was doing that is,

1155
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,012
I bought you this nice
vintage Polaroid camera

1156
00:53:43,095 --> 00:53:45,531
and I just wanted to make sure
it worked before I gave it to you.

1157
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,641
So, here's your gift."

1158
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:49,434
Fuck you!

1159
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:51,353
And she felt horrible,

1160
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:54,899
which is the greatest
Valentine's Day gift I've ever received.

1161
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,359
New York, thank you again!

1162
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,367
This was awesome.

1163
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,327
Thank you guys again so much
for coming out.

1164
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,622
Thank you very, very much.

1165
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:16,545
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
This was fucking awesome. Thanks.

1166
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:18,588
Good night.

1167
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,525
These are my parents.

1168
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,876
Thank you again. Good night.
