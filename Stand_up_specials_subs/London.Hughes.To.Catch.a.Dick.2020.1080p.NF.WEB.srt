1
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:11,052
London Hughes, I hope you're ready.

2
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:16,016
It's your first Netflix special.
Go out there, make them Americans laugh!

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,853
Make the world love you,
and talk about dick as never before.

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,856
Because you are comedy Beyoncé.
Yes, you are.

5
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,316
You're comedy...
You're comedy Richard Pryor.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,610
You're female Richard Pr...
You're Kevin Hart!

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,779
You're female Kevin Hart! Yes, you are!

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:33,575
The world's gonna love you.
'Cause you're a star, London Hughes.

9
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,578
You're gonna be amazing.
It's gonna go so perfect.

10
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,872
How does that sound?

11
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,499
Sounds great.

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,669
-You're gonna be amazing tonight.
-Thank you.

13
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,504
-No kissing. Covid.
-Yeah.

14
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,924
-Oh, you're needed on set.
-Oh, great. Amazing.

15
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,052
Well, thank you so much, Richard.

16
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,137
-Uh, it's Jeff.
-Jeff, okay.

17
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,264
- Okay.
- Jeff! Jeff! Okay.

18
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,391
Time to catch some dick.

19
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,226
Oh, shitting hell.

20
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,152
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please make some noise</i>

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:13,990
<i>for the very talented and funny,</i>
<i>Miss London Hughes!</i>

22
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,763
Make some noise, Los Angeles!

23
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,473
Yes!

24
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,391
Oh my God!

25
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,853
Guys, hello! Hello!

26
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,772
I'm London Hughes. I'm really funny.

27
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:51,486
Hey, thank you so much for coming
to my first-ever Netflix special.

28
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,489
Oh my God! Oh my God!

29
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:57,659
Oh my God! And it's during the pandemic.

30
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,371
You risked a disease for me.
You guys all got tested for me.

31
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,998
I feel like
we're in a serious relationship.

32
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,750
Oh Guys, I appreciate it.

33
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,921
Let me start by saying I'm totally aware
of the elephant in the room.

34
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,632
I'm totally aware
that I don't look how I sound.

35
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,803
Totally aware. I look like Keyshia Beyoncé
but sound like Penelope.

36
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,430
I'm aware. I'm aware. I am not like you.

37
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,809
I am Black British, okay?
I am a British person.

38
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,562
I moved to this beautiful country
in February.

39
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:28,940
Yeah.

40
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,234
Yeah.

41
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,152
February.

42
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,904
Right before it went to shit!

43
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,615
The global pandemic went to shit!

44
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,741
Everyone's like,

45
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,911
"Uh, it's a global pandemic.
Think of the elderly."

46
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,371
Don't think of the elderly.

47
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,666
Think of the single women
who thought we had options this year.

48
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,960
We thought we had fucking options.

49
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,798
Options ran out! No options.
Every day's like a dickless Groundhog Day.

50
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,883
Know what I mean?

51
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,927
It's worse for me
'cause I been here 8 months,

52
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,472
I ain't fucked one American yet.
I could've fucked you by now, you.

53
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,224
I could have fucked you.

54
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:04,934
I ain't fucked no Amer...

55
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:08,521
I haven't been able to live out
my American wet dream. Okay?

56
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,817
It's upsetting for me.
It's really sad, but it's on theme

57
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,071
because this show is called
<i>To Catch a Dick</i>. Okay?

58
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,407
That's the name of this show.

59
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,701
It's called <i>To Catch a Dick</i>.

60
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,953
Are we ready to catch a dick?

61
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,331
Yeah!

62
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,499
Here we go. Let me start it.

63
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,128
Okay, I'm owning it, right?

64
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,340
So I wrote this show
'cause I was pissed off.

65
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,301
I know I don't look it,
but I'm pissed off, right?

66
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:42,222
I'll tell you why. I just turned 31.
I know. I don't look it. Right? Just 31.

67
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:45,058
I'm very attractive.
It's not a joke. It's more factual.

68
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,602
I'm rich.
I'm rich as fuck, guys, seriously.

69
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,147
When I eat McDonald's,
it's in Beverly Hills, okay?

70
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,857
I'm rich as fuck.

71
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,443
I've got Beyoncé's hair from 2003. Mm-hm.

72
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,111
I really do. It's factual.

73
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,197
I've got zero gag reflex. Zero!

74
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,616
Zero. Thank you!

75
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,660
Zero. Zero.

76
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,827
But I'm single.

77
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,204
Aww!

78
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,539
Here's the thing.
That's the correct reaction.

79
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,918
When you're single in your 20s,
it's fine, innit?

80
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,337
When I was single in my 20s,
there was no judgment.

81
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,006
In my 20s, I was sitting on faces,
sitting on faces.

82
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,384
Sucking dick and sitting on faces.

83
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,387
From 2009 onwards,
my mouth was full. It was fine.

84
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,888
No judgment.

85
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,391
In my twenties,
I was playing bareback roulette.

86
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,393
Who's played bare...

87
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,271
-"Did he come inside you?"
-"Dunno, it's bareback roulette."

88
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:34,941
Is it just me that played bare...
She played bareback roulette.

89
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:38,361
You are laughing too hard.
She played bareback roulette.

90
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,113
In your twenties. It's fine.

91
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,324
No judgment in your twenties.
It's about living your best life.

92
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,285
But when you hit your thirties…

93
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,537
Oh-ho.

94
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,455
the singleness starts to smell.

95
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,917
People are like,
"Oh, you're 30."

96
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,294
"Oh."

97
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,087
"Oh, you're single. Oh."

98
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,799
They smell the desperation.
My mum got a whiff of it, okay?

99
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,303
She's like, "Now that you're 30,
why don't you settle down, huh?

100
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,762
and have some kids, huh?"

101
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,724
"You're 30,
so why don't you settle down, huh?

102
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,642
and have some kids, huh?"

103
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:13,730
I was like, "Kids?
Chill, I haven't had an abortion yet."

104
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,814
Know what I mean?

105
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:18,693
"Let me have a couple of abortions first
before I commit to that shit."

106
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:23,781
I've got options. Know what I mean?
They're human herpes. That's for life.

107
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,576
Kids are shit.
I can say that. Kids are fucking shit.

108
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,662
Some of my best friends
used to be children. I can say it.

109
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,082
Kids are shit.
I love you're clapping that. They are.

110
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,709
A lot of my friends have kids.

111
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,463
It's always the basic ones
that just find love first, innit?

112
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:42,258
Out of your friends, it's always
the ugly ones that are married first.

113
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,846
I have a lot of ugly,
happy, basic friends.

114
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,848
They're here tonight, right?

115
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,725
They look at me and say,

116
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,019
"London, you need to go out there."

117
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,023
"You'll find a single guy in a club.
Go on find a single guy in a club!"

118
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,358
A single guy in a club?

119
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:01,486
You got more chance of finding
a Black girl in a Judd Apatow movie.

120
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,739
Think about it. There's fucking none.

121
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,282
Sort it out, Judd!

122
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,159
I'm available!

123
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,160
Right?

124
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,746
They're like, "You're the problem."

125
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,581
"You're single because of you."

126
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,000
"You're single because you're confident."

127
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,419
"You're single because you're successful."

128
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,673
"You're single 'cause you're a comedian.
It's too much." I'm like,

129
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,010
"Guys, all of that stuff on a man,
that is a catch."

130
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,180
"A successful, confident, comedian man,
that's a catch."

131
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,599
I'd fuck him. That's a great person.

132
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,268
That's fucking Kevin Hart. Okay?

133
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,686
That's a catch.

134
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,524
Apparently, on a woman, it's too much.
Apparently, I'm too much, guys.

135
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,902
Apparently.
All I know is that if I was a mute

136
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,696
that worked in 7-Eleven,
I'd be married by now.

137
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,076
It's true.
And I ain't even been proposed to.

138
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:54,163
There's bitches in Kentucky with no teeth
that have been proposed to.

139
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,458
What the fuck is wrong with me?

140
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,420
I'm starting to think I'm the problem.

141
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,631
So I decided to look back
at my dick-catching history.

142
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,426
To see where the fuck I went wrong.

143
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,220
Will you join me on this journey?

144
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,139
Okay, let's go!

145
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,016
I'm going on a journey.

146
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,730
I've arrived.
I've gone back in time. It was fast.

147
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,732
I went back in time.

148
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,652
Back to 94 years in the past,
which was 19...

149
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,572
I'm shit at math, fuck it.
Gone back in the past.

150
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,242
Okay? To the birth
of my grandma, Grandma Mel.

151
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:36,164
Amazing woman, 93, 94 years old.
Just sassy, Jamaican, cute.

152
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,749
Massive ho! My grandmother's a ho!

153
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,545
My grandma knows she's a ho.
Lord knows she's a ho, okay?

154
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:47,425
My grandma caught so much dick,
it ruined my mom's life.

155
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,136
She really did. I'll tell you why.

156
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,015
My grandma had five kids
with five different baby fathers, okay?

157
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,683
To be fair, she's from Jamaica.

158
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,728
The only thing to do there
is fuck and listen to Bob Marley.

159
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,146
♪ <i>We're bangin'</i>
<i>We're jammin' ♪</i>

160
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,649
That's it!
That's all you can fucking do in Jamaica.

161
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,653
Here's why I know that my grandma's
dick-catching fucked up my mom's life.

162
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,657
My mom told me she met her dad twice,
and they were two different people.

163
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,828
My grandma got her playing
Paternity Guess Who with my mom's life.

164
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,331
-"Does he wear glasses?"
-"I don't know."

165
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,794
My grandma's a fucking ho.
Let's talk about my mom.

166
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,757
She's great. She's gonna be watching this.
She's amazing, okay?

167
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,845
She's successful, married twice,
works really hard, really smart...

168
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,472
Fucking ho! My mom's a ho!

169
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,059
My mom's a ho too.
She's a ho. She is a ho.

170
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,811
My mom caught so much dick,

171
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,688
it ruined her life.

172
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,106
I'll tell you why.

173
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,193
My mom was a runner. She was fast.

174
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,195
Hundred meters sprint. Fast.

175
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,657
At 18, she did the trials
for the Olympic Games.

176
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,951
The Olympic motherfucking Games.

177
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:58,663
Olympic Games at 18, I know.
"Whoo!" indeed. "Whoo!" indeed.

178
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,831
But it gets sad. But it gets sad.

179
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,377
Because at 18, unfortunately,
she caught a sudden case of dick.

180
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,214
She did. She did.

181
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,299
That dick resulted in a pregnancy.

182
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,052
Not with me. I'm a blessing.
With my brother. Alright?

183
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,222
I'm a fucking blessing. With my brother.

184
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,267
She had my brother.
She gave birth to my brother,

185
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,061
and my grandma was so upset
that she got pregnant at 18

186
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,272
that she kicked her out.
Fucking hypocrite.

187
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:29,151
She's just trying to be like you, hon.
Your ho-ness was hereditary. Okay?

188
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,946
Kicked her out the house,
my mom had to quit running,

189
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,490
get a normal job,
and be a normal fucking person.

190
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,326
She quit running,
became a nurse, raised my brother,

191
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,496
and ladies and gentlemen,
my brother grew up to be…

192
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,623
a security guard.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,878
My mom quit the Olympics
for a security guard!

194
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,756
If it was me I could understand,
but a security guard?

195
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,050
That's like me, now,
the height of my career,

196
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,845
en route to being
the next female Richard Pryor…

197
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,763
Thank you. It's true.

198
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,474
…suddenly catching a case of dick
nine months out.

199
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,602
Never hear from me again.
I push out my child,

200
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,105
and he has the audacity
to become a TikTok star. Fuck kids!

201
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,399
Kids are shit, man.

202
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,860
They're shit... I just... Kids like...

203
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:13,070
They're just disrespectful.

204
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,740
Women, we don't have to have them,
you know, ladies.

205
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,868
We don't have to have kids.
We're just… Why?

206
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,413
They're not worth it a lot of the time.
They ain't got no banter.

207
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,249
Kids ain't got no banter.
They don't say anything exciting.

208
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,627
-"I drew a giraffe."
-"Fuck off!"

209
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,795
"I don't give a fuck about your giraffe."

210
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,881
They're really overrated.

211
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,967
Who's got kids? Make some noise.

212
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,803
Okay, ladies...
I like that the men didn't make a noise.

213
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,640
Men, you don't have kids.
You get kids, okay?

214
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,768
Kids are like pets to you.
They're dogs. A bitch gave birth to them

215
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,937
so you can play with them.
Pretend they're yours. That's the reality.

216
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,357
Kids are shit,
and you'll relate to this, girl,

217
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,485
because I think
babies are disrespectful to women.

218
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,696
They are.
Babies are disrespectful to women.

219
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,908
I'll tell you why. As a woman,
you catch a sudden case of dick,

220
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,577
it results in a pregnancy, nine months.

221
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,081
People just go, "Nine... " No, nine months!

222
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,167
Nine long months,
making a human in your gut,

223
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,378
making eyes, ears, and elbows in your gut.

224
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,130
Making a human in your gut.
Can't drink to get through.

225
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,800
Making eyes, ears, elbows
in your gut for 9 months.

226
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,094
A fully formed human, not like in Ikea.

227
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,679
Fully formed, human,

228
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,515
in your fucking gut for nine months.

229
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,850
Can't drink, making a human. Nine months.

230
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,144
Nine long months,
making a human in your gut.

231
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,480
Then you've got to push that fucker out.

232
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,023
It might take two days.

233
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:34,193
It might take two fucking days.
It will rip your vagina.

234
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,946
Rip it out. Ruin it! Ruin it! Ruin it!

235
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,156
Nine months. Ruined! Nine months. Ruined!

236
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,411
You push that shit out, and there's blood,
blood, blood, blood, blood.

237
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,912
Blood everywhere, blood-

238
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,497
Blood! Blood!

239
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,584
You pick up the bloody baby!
You pick up the bloody baby!

240
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,796
And you cut the cord.
You cut your vag. You're cutting.

241
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,258
You hold the baby. You look at it,
and it has the audacity

242
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,510
to look exactly like the father.

243
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,309
You fucking kidding me? If that was me,
I'd leave it at the hospital.

244
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,811
"I don't know who that is."

245
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,231
"I made it, but it don't look like me.
It's a joke."

246
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,025
Ladies, we don't have to have kids.
They're overrated.

247
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,320
Let's talk about the fathers, okay?
Let's talk about the men.

248
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,780
My dad is a father.

249
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,366
He is. My dad is a father.

250
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,494
And I do know my dad.
Sorry to fuck up the stereotype. I do.

251
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,538
Right? We get along really well.

252
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,957
He's a great guy. Mr. Hughes is amazing.

253
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,917
Fun fact about my dad, he's 60,

254
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,421
and he's in an over-fifties soccer team
called Aston Viagra.

255
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,380
Okay?

256
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,843
That's my dad, Mr. Hughes.
He's a great man. I love him.

257
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,179
I've got two older brothers.
I love them too.

258
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,682
So I've got Alex,
the security guard mistake. You know him.

259
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,642
He's gonna watch this and love this.

260
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,104
And then I've got Joel.
He's like a happy accident.

261
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,607
And Alex and Joel, they are amazing.

262
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,610
Amazing men,
great role models, fucking players.

263
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,821
My brothers are fucking players. Okay?

264
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,490
They caught so much puss…

265
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:08,287
…it ruined my life.
Okay, I'll tell you a story.

266
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,791
My full name is London Dionne Micha Stacey
Stephanie Estina Knibbs-Hughes.

267
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:15,961
I'll do it again. My full name is
London Dionne Micha Stacey Stephanie

268
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,547
Estina Knibbs-Hughes. I remixed it.
That's my full name.

269
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,924
So here's the thing.

270
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,300
After I came out,

271
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:24,887
like, my parents were so happy
that I was born

272
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,515
that my mom thought
it would be a great idea

273
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,975
if every member of my family…

274
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,228
…gave me a name.

275
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,689
Okay, so, my parents called me London

276
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:38,192
'cause I'm from London,
and they're not that creative.

277
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,822
And then I had Dionne,
Dionne. Celine Dion.

278
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:46,534
Dionne Warwick. Dionne.
Soulful, Dionne. Dionne

279
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,162
Thank you. That's from my grandma.
And then I had Micha. Micha.

280
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:54,500
Colloquial. Colloquial. Micha.
Micha. Colloquial. Colloquial.

281
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,876
That's from my dad.

282
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,628
And then I had Stacey!

283
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,094
That's from my brother, my brother Joel.

284
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,929
Then I had Stephanie!

285
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,267
That's from my brother Alex.

286
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,436
Then Estina. Latina!

287
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,356
Estina.
Estina from my quarter-Cuban mother.

288
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:22,152
And then, my last name is Knibbs-Hughes.
So that's my full name, right?

289
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,531
It's a nice name,
but let's look at Stacey and Stephanie.

290
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,242
'Cause that shit don't float.
Here we go, Stacey.

291
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:32,246
My brother Joel...
My brother Joel names me Stacey

292
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,667
after the chick
he used to fancy in kindergarten class.

293
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,254
Called Stacey Hughes.

294
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,007
My brother at five years old
named his only sister

295
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,676
after some bitch
he used to eat glitter with. Right?

296
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,512
I don't know the bitch
or what she's done with her life.

297
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,016
Actually, I was gonna call this special
<i>Looking for Stacey</i>. Okay?

298
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,145
Where's the camera?
Stacey Hughes, Stacey Hughes, who's 35,

299
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,231
and went to David Livingstone
Primary School with my brother, Joel,

300
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,109
I need to let you know
your name did not go in vain.

301
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:04,695
Greatness was named after you. Okay?

302
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,907
You fucking made it.

303
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,450
Fucking made it, Stacey.

304
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,828
I hope you're not dead or a crackhead,
but you fucking made it.

305
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,163
Fucking Stacey.

306
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,165
Don't know the bitch.

307
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,335
And then my brother Alex
named me Stephanie.

308
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,005
Mm-hm. Stephanie. After his girlfriend.

309
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,882
Stephanie.

310
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,594
'Cause he wanted to prove to Stephanie…

311
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,762
…that he was serious.

312
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,014
About Stephanie.

313
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,059
He later cheated on Stephanie.

314
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,479
He cheated on Stephanie with Stacey.

315
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,486
Stephanie found out and keyed his car.

316
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,697
Stephanie stole his dog, Tupac.

317
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,449
He never got Tupac back.

318
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,452
And I still got the bitch's name!

319
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:57,164
These girls, Stacey and Stephanie!
Oh, shit it out, Jesus Christ!

320
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,334
These are the men in my life.
These are my role models.

321
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,420
These are who I look up to.
No wonder I'm so fucked up. Okay?

322
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,758
No wonder. I try and be like them
in every way. I try and be a player, man.

323
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,594
I try and be a player.
Try to suck dick and be a player.

324
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,805
Try to fuck and suck dick
and be a player.

325
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,974
But I couldn't fuck
nor suck dick and be a player

326
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,643
'cause I hadn't grown into my face. Okay?

327
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,813
I was an ugly child.
I'm hot now. I was ugly.

328
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,941
As a kid, I was a gremlin, a demon.

329
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,527
I looked like a feminine Jay-Z.

330
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,738
You can see it. There are remnants of it.

331
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,240
You can see it.

332
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,243
I got a hunchback of Notre No Dick.
I had nothing.

333
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,455
I was, like... Nobody wanted to fuck me.
No one, no kids, nobody.

334
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,916
That sounds weird.
But no one wanted to fuck me.

335
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,502
And the one thing I wanted to be in life,

336
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,255
the main thing I wanted
with all of my vagina,

337
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,465
the one thing I wanted to be…

338
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,718
was a ho. Seriously.

339
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,804
Honestly, some kids
wanna be like a teacher or invisible,

340
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,807
I wanted to be a ho,
and my mom helped with that.

341
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,809
Sounds weird, but she did.

342
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,103
At age 14,
my mom decided to leave London,

343
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,147
and she bought a hotel in Brighton.

344
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,441
Brighton's a seaside town outside London.

345
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,902
I was, like, "Cool! A whole new ho life.
I'm gonna start again."

346
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,406
"I'm 14 years old. I'm gonna be catching
so much seaside dick."

347
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,867
"I'm gonna be fucking on the beach."

348
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,326
Plus, she had a hotel.

349
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,038
It's got ho in the title.

350
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,790
I'll fuck on the beach and in the hotel!

351
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,710
Fucking on the beach
and in the hotel.

352
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,129
Fucking! Fucking on the beach…

353
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,674
Fu… cking.

354
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,556
I wasn't fucking on the beach
or in the hotel.

355
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,558
I tell you why, fun fact:

356
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:43,145
Teenage boys don't like girls
who write <i>Frasier</i> fan fiction, okay?

357
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:44,772
They don't!

358
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,400
I used to work myself
into episodes of <i>Frasier</i> for fun, okay?

359
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,070
I was Denise, his adopted daughter, okay?

360
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,907
Teenage boys don't like <i>Frasier.</i>
Seattle ain't sexy, okay?

361
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,827
I decided, if I was gonna be a ho,
I needed to find ho friends.

362
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,580
Hos make the world go round.
Ho friends are important.

363
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,917
And every group of girls has a ho friend.
Even tonight.

364
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,503
Every single group of girls here
has a ho friend.

365
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,962
Everyone has a ho friend.

366
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,550
And if you don't have a ho friend,
that's because <i>you are</i> the ho friend.

367
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,054
Okay? Look around you. Look around you.

368
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,973
Ho! Ho! Ho! I can feel it. The pheromones.

369
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,268
I can feel it.
There are some hos in this house, okay?

370
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,479
They'll be laughing the loudest next.

371
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,232
Trust me. There's some hos here.
I know my people.

372
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,400
I searched Brighton for their best hos.

373
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,196
And I found three.
The first ho I found. Her name was Tina.

374
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,783
Now Tina's a ho 'cause most girls
lose their virginity at nighttime

375
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,576
in the bedroom to their boyfriend.

376
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,747
She lost hers in the daytime in a car park
to someone else's boyfriend.

377
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,625
She was fucking lovely but a fucking ho.
That was Tina.

378
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,503
The next ho was called Dribbles.
I'll leave it at that.

379
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,215
Dribbles. Dribbles.

380
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,385
Dribbles.

381
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,096
Her name was Dribbles.

382
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,559
Alright.

383
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,395
The final ho was called
Rita Who Has Chlamydia.

384
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,481
Full name! Maybe because
there was a different girl in school

385
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,775
called Rita, who didn't have chlamydia.

386
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,528
So we had to tell
the difference between them.

387
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:17,364
-Which Rita are we talking about?
-Rita With Chlamydia.

388
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,199
Even though Rita had chlamydia,

389
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,452
she was so hot, the boys just risked it,
you know what I mean?

390
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,830
She was worth a disease, okay?

391
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,624
These are my friends,
and my nickname was:

392
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,501
Fourteen-Year-Old Virgin.

393
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,923
Yeah. Says a lot about seaside towns
when "14-year-old virgin" is an insult.

394
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,259
Yeah? They were fucking in Brighton.

395
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:41,096
These were my girls, my squad,
my besties. I fucking loved them.

396
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,432
We lived our best lives,
sucked loads of dick,

397
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,269
and we were like a little girl group.
Like the A-Team if "A" stood for anal.

398
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,397
Alright? These were my fucking homies.

399
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,524
And they taught me so much. Okay?

400
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,777
The first thing these girls taught me
was how to suck dick. Oh!

401
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,238
I sucked it so well,
they called me the seagull.

402
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,159
Seagull.

403
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,246
Seagull.

404
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,667
Seagull.

405
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,004
It's 'cause I swallow it. I thought
that was clear. I swallow it whole.

406
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:14,922
Seagull.

407
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,929
The second thing they taught me...
Now this is interesting.

408
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,680
The second thing they taught me,

409
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,142
I love saying this 'cause this separates
the hos from the gals.

410
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,646
So this next thing they taught me
was the ice cream trick.

411
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,315
Does anyone here... Baby girl at the back.

412
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,151
Do you know that?
Anyone know about the ice cream trick?

413
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,237
Okay. Listen, ladies. Okay.

414
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,365
Ladies, you know
when you're fucking a guy, right?

415
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:44,743
I love how silent you've gone.
You're like, "Let's go!"

416
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,371
"I wanna know about this ice cream trick!"

417
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:51,041
The hos are like, "I'm sorry.
What? Lessons to be learned. Let's go."

418
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,252
"Take a note. She knows."
Okay, take notes.

419
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,380
Ladies, you know
when you're fucking a guy,

420
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:59,424
but there's too much pressure,
and he goes limp.

421
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,593
That's never happened to me, but…

422
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,888
for some reason, he just goes limp. Yeah?

423
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,768
Here's what you do.
Don't call the police. No, don't do that.

424
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,646
Go to the freezer and get some ice cream.

425
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,481
Take the ice cream.
Don't put it on his dick.

426
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:17,150
That's how you get a yeast infection.
Don't do that.

427
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,486
Feed him the ice cream,
and something happens.

428
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,946
Ice cream's an aphrodisiac.

429
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,156
Something happens
with the sweet and the cold.

430
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:28,036
And the dick brain and head brain align,
and the dick will pop up for 17 seconds.

431
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,623
Jump on that shit
and ride it into the night. It's not rape.

432
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,334
Ride it into the motherfucking night.

433
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,046
That's what you do, ladies. Trust me.
It works. Love the ice cream trick.

434
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,967
The next thing the girls taught me
was licking the gooch.

435
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,720
America, do you know what the gooch is?

436
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,347
There's a language barrier.
You guys say something else.

437
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,641
I think you guys call it the "taint."

438
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,394
Right? The "taint."

439
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,396
We call it the "gooch," okay?

440
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,940
In Britain, we call it the "gooch."
I'll explain.

441
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,234
There's a sensitive part in a man's life,

442
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,029
underneath the balls.
A little sensitive strip.

443
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:06,074
A little sensitive strip
that leads directly to the anus, okay?

444
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,160
That little landing strip.

445
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:12,122
Ladies,
you lick that shit with your tongue.

446
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,042
Oh my God.
Any man becomes your bitch. They're like…

447
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:15,959
Ooh! Oh my God.

448
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,419
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ooh!

449
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,004
I like it. I like it. Ooh! Ah!

450
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:23,133
Don't get excited and lick the bum hole.
They like it and think they're gay.

451
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,011
They're like, "Oh!
I've never felt this way before."

452
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,137
Literally.

453
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,140
Any man becomes your bitch.
They love it. They love it.

454
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:34,603
Lick the gooch, ladies. Lick it up, down,
left, right. I call that a Gucci handbag.

455
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,357
Get yourself a Gucci handbag.

456
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,985
We all deserve a Gucci handbag.

457
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,280
And the final thing the A-Team taught me

458
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,241
was the big Black dick myth.

459
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,871
Okay? Yeah, you're laughing
'cause you understand there is a myth

460
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,207
that has plagued white men for centuries.

461
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,043
And they've suffered in silence.

462
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,338
Suffered.

463
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,966
This is the myth, okay?
No, this is serious.

464
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,969
This is the myth

465
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,431
that Black guys
have bigger dicks than white guys.

466
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,393
You know it! Lies!

467
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:18,522
Lies! I'm here today to tell you,
L.A., that it's not true!

468
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,900
It's not true, trust me,
I did my research for the show, okay?

469
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:27,322
I did! I did! I did! I did! I did!

470
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,865
I did it. No, I did.

471
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:33,036
I fucked 100 white dudes, 100 Black dudes.
Coagulated the figures, got the data!

472
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,414
I got it, okay? Here are my findings.

473
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,040
Uh, so, here's the thing.

474
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,418
Black guys don't have bigger dicks.

475
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,837
It's not true, white guys.
You've been lied to.

476
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,800
Society has lied to you. It's not true.
Black guys just have bigger default dicks.

477
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,554
Okay? For example,
you're fucking a Black guy, right?

478
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,013
He whips it out, boom!

479
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,976
That's an exact representational
of what it looks like, okay?

480
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,647
Boom, okay? But then,
when he gets horny, it doesn't get bigger.

481
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,982
It just goes up.

482
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,526
It doesn't really get bigger.
It just goes up.

483
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,154
Whereas white dudes
will whip out some shit,

484
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,198
and you're like, "What the fuck is that?"

485
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,618
"What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?"

486
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,122
"That won't even break the seal.
What the fuck is that?"

487
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,542
But you give that shit a bit of love…

488
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,920
…and that shit starts to grow…

489
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,631
into something magical.

490
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,051
I always feel so proud.
I'm like, "I did that!"

491
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,553
"I made that shit grow!"

492
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,388
"I'm a farmer!"

493
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,434
"I fucking love that shit right there.
I love it!"

494
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:45,317
It's true! See, I learned all of this
from the ladies, from the A-Team.

495
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,279
After four years with them,
I left Brighton 'cause I completed it.

496
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,823
I completed it.
I fucked everyone.

497
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:56,453
I decided to move to London
to suck dick in a new city, right?

498
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:00,165
I'm ready to suck dick,
but also, maybe a career change.

499
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,127
So I decided that I wanted to be on TV,

500
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,004
and I wanted to host TV shows.

501
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,132
And I auditioned to host a show
on a cable channel.

502
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,719
I auditioned for it. It went really well,
and I got the job, guys.

503
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,056
I got my first TV job. Thank you.

504
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,266
I got my first TV job at 18.

505
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,978
Um, the channel was called Babestation.

506
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:25,607
Now, there's a language barrier.
Let me explain what Babestation is.

507
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,276
Babestation is a live porn channel.

508
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:33,281
I was hosting a live porn channel.
Like OnlyFans but for cable.

509
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,535
Right? I was hosting that.
That was my first TV job.

510
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,287
I did it in the daytime
'cause I'm classy. So…

511
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:43,667
it was my job to keep talking on live TV,
fully clothed, just keep talking.

512
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,211
At eleven o'clock, I went.
The girls came out.

513
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,047
It was tits out, fingers in.
I weren't part of that.

514
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:54,511
And I genuinely thought that even though
I was hosting a live porn channel,

515
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,347
a TV exec somewhere out there

516
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,100
would find me at the back of cable.

517
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:05,355
Way at the back, and find me,
and see me, and make me a star.

518
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,316
Even though I was hosting live porn,

519
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,527
all I could think about was content.

520
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,237
Give the people content.

521
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,614
So I came up
with features for Babestation.

522
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,826
The first feature
was called Hughes's Shoes.

523
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,372
Riveting stuff, where I'd talk about
the shoes I was wearing that day.

524
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,331
So, I'd be like,

525
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,501
"Hi, you're watching Babestation with me,
London Hughes."

526
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,962
"And now it's time for Hughes's Shoes."

527
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:31,506
I'd put my feet into shot
and talk about my shoes.

528
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,883
Today high heels, tomorrow trainers,

529
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:36,094
the next day flip-flops, then flats.

530
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,430
And it got a lot of attention.

531
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,849
Mainly from old men,
but a lot of attention.

532
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,559
They were texting and emailing.

533
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,477
-"Touch your feet."
-"I'll touch my feet."

534
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,521
-"Lick your toes."
-"I'll lick my toes."

535
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,773
-"Stroke your feet."
-"I'll stroke my feet."

536
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,400
-"Kiss your feet."
-"I'll kiss my feet."

537
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,612
And our viewers went up
from three to seven. It was a hit.

538
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,030
Fucking loved it.

539
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:58,908
After three weeks of Hughes's Shoes,
our producer asked to speak to me.

540
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,620
I was like,
"Obviously, she's gonna give me a raise."

541
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,749
Oh, no. She said
I was asking men to wank over my feet,

542
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,376
and I was lowering the tone of the show.

543
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:14,007
They complained, and they fired me.
I got sacked on the spot.

544
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,177
I was fired,
booted out of Babestation, goodbye!

545
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:22,307
It was really weird because my next job
after that was hosting children's TV.

546
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,353
Seriously! My résumé reads,
"Babestation, porn channel,"

547
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:28,313
and then "Children's BBC."

548
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:29,898
That was my next job.

549
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,568
Now, after getting the sack
from a major porn channel,

550
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,738
I felt like I should start dating.
I got stories to tell.

551
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,824
I started online dating,
which was great, and I met this guy.

552
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,369
We were chatting online,
and he had a foot fetish.

553
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,828
I knew he had a foot fetish

554
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,872
'cause he asked to see
a picture of my feet.

555
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:49,042
He's like, "Send a picture of your feet."
So I did. He's like, "Another one."

556
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,669
So I sent him the other foot.

557
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:54,589
You got two feet, so I did this one.

558
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,593
I got two feet, so I did that.
He fucking loved it.

559
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,178
He loved seeing my toes.

560
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,429
He loved it!

561
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,598
He liked seeing my toes
in different positions.

562
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,851
He liked toes up high, down low,
by the sea, on a window ledge.

563
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,728
Fucking loved it. Right?

564
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,939
And we called it a little "toe toe shoot."

565
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:14,359
He was like, "The toe toe shoot."
And I was sending pictures in.

566
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,736
We were toe sexting for, like, a week.

567
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,447
After that, he wanted to see me
and my toes in real life.

568
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,366
-"I want to see you."
-"Okay."

569
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,994
So I met him at Clapham Junction
train station in south London.

570
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,706
It was winter,
and I was wearing Ugg boots.

571
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,167
Let me not lie. I was broke.
I was wearing Flugg boots, okay?

572
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,086
Reality, I was wearing Flugg boots.

573
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:36,005
And I met him. I gave him a hug.
He hugged me back.

574
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,550
"Good to see you. What are those?"

575
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,971
I was like, "Flugg boots. They're £20.
I can get some for your sister."

576
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,850
He was like, "No! "No! No! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! I don't care about the shoes."

577
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,185
"I care about the feet in the shoes."

578
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,605
"Why are your feet in those furry shoes?"

579
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,649
"They need to be free."

580
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,567
I was like…

581
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,779
"Stranger danger! Stranger danger!"

582
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:01,740
He was, like, "No, no, no, no. No!"

583
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,409
-"I'm not a weirdo. Trust... "
-"No! You are!"

584
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:09,205
He was like, "No, no. I'm not a weirdo.
I just love your toes."

585
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,458
-"They're beautiful."
-"What do you want?"

586
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,835
He was, like, "Listen, listen. calm down."

587
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,881
"I would love it, love it, love it,
if you just took the shoes off."

588
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,674
-"What?"
-"Just take them off."

589
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,469
-"Take your feet out of the hairy shoes."
-"No!"

590
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,846
-"Take 'em off."
-"No!"

591
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,931
-"Take 'em off. I'll buy you new shoes."
-"Okay!"

592
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:32,812
Okay! I took those fuckers off.
I threw them on the train tracks.

593
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,898
I never saw that shit again. Okay?

594
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:37,108
I ran to his car barefoot
like Fred Flintstone…

595
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,028
I got to his car.

596
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,490
He said he was gonna buy me
some new shoes, and he did.

597
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,325
He took me to Harrods.

598
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,202
Harrods is the most bougiest,

599
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,538
expensive-assed department store
in the whole of Europe.

600
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,207
It's so fucking bougie.

601
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:56,044
It's the only store where you can buy
a TV and a real-life lion.

602
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,380
Honestly! It's fucking bougie.
Fucking bougie.

603
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,133
He took me to Harrods. To Harrods.

604
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,135
I'm 18, never been in Harrods before.

605
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,721
I'm walking around,
"Oh my God, look at the money."

606
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,682
Felt like the Black woman
in <i>Pretty Woman</i> that didn't exist.

607
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:11,518
I was like, "Oh my God!"

608
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,813
"This is so amazing!
This is just amazing."

609
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,816
He took me
to the shoe department bit in Harrods.

610
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,276
And there were some expensive-ass shoes.

611
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,196
There were wall-to-wall expensive shoes.
I was like, "Oh my God."

612
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,532
He took out a pair of shoes
I can't pronounce.

613
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,201
You know those Minono... Minonos...

614
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,161
The Minono Bohniks.

615
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,664
You know, the <i>Sex And The City</i> shoes.

616
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,042
The shoes that look like
they should come with a free cocktail.

617
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,460
He got me Minono Bohniks.

618
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,671
I ain't put on stilettos
before in my life.

619
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:43,633
I'm putting these shoes on and trying
to walk like a professional human, okay?

620
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,261
And I'm all Bambi on ice,
just trying to…

621
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:50,682
struggle with these Minono Bohniks,
trying to act like I know what I'm doing.

622
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,809
I'm like, "This is great. Oh, my!"

623
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,645
They cost £1,200! They were red.

624
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,564
He bought me red shoes! Okay?

625
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,066
I had red shoes on my feet. I was ready!

626
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,402
I was living my best life. Okay?

627
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,946
I couldn't believe it.

628
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,990
It felt like I'd won the lottery.

629
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,033
We went back to his house.

630
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:13,079
I remember walking into his bedroom,
bursting open the door.

631
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,290
And I was taken aback.

632
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,166
I was startled.

633
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,877
I was surprised. I was shocked.

634
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,503
Because in his room

635
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:27,218
was wall-to-wall-to-wall
of designer women's shoes.

636
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,387
Right? And I was... I was in awe.

637
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,265
He came up behind me,
and it was like that scene in <i>Lion King.</i>

638
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:34,893
He was like, "All this could be yours."

639
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,647
"From the Louboutins in the east,

640
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,482
to the Pradas in the west."

641
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,277
"All this could be yours."

642
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,987
And I'm like, "I'm ready!"

643
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,282
"I'm ready to suck dick for shoes."

644
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,254
I seagull-ed the fuck out of him.

645
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,257
I fucked him good!

646
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,469
After the sex,
he gifted me a pair of shoes.

647
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,430
I was with him for six weeks.

648
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,767
I got 12 pairs of shoes!

649
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,270
Yes, that's right! 12 pairs of shoes.

650
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,482
I was so into him. I loved him.
I wanted to marry him.

651
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,068
I don't remember his name,
but I loved him.

652
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,695
I loved him.
I wanted to walk down the aisle…

653
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:34,953
But… randomly out of the blue,

654
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,622
a week later,
he broke up with me like that.

655
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:42,418
He was cheating on me. I know 'cause I saw
the bitch's toes on his laptop. Right?

656
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,798
He found a new bitch. Apparently
she puts nail polish on her toes.

657
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,258
Some shellac bitch. Some gel bitch.

658
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,637
Fucking bitch!

659
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,931
Left me for her, and then I was like,

660
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:58,810
"You know what, I'm really upset,
but I get to keep the shoes, right?"

661
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,354
I won 12 pairs of shoes. They were mine.

662
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,439
I sucked dick for those shoes. Mine.

663
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,900
He was like, "Oh, no. They're my shoes."

664
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,444
And he took the shoes back.

665
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:11,155
Don't, no.
'Cause I'm still triggered. Don't.

666
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,324
It was like
saying goodbye to my children,

667
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,576
"Bye, Louis. Bye, Christian."

668
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,079
"Bye, Yves Saint-Laurent. See you later."

669
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,542
And then... Your laugh is epic.

670
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,294
I never saw the shoes again. Okay?

671
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,630
I never... Listen. No, I'm still triggered.

672
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,882
But I knew that relationship fucked me up

673
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,218
because most girls
after a relationship ends,

674
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:36,305
they get a new wardrobe or new hairdo.
I had to get a pedicure, okay?.

675
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,560
Had to put some glitter on my toes
to remind me I was that bitch, alright?

676
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,855
Thank you. I walked out of his life
and into a new relationship.

677
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,107
Kind of. I started chatting to this guy.

678
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,693
He's famous now.
He's a boxer in the UK.

679
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:52,280
And, I mean, at the time
he wasn't as famous as me,

680
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,365
and now he's fucking famous, right?

681
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,036
But here's the thing.
I sucked his dick in 2012, right?

682
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,205
And in 2012, he won gold in the Olympics.

683
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,833
Okay? That just goes to show…

684
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:08,963
That just goes to show
I give the blowjobs of champions.

685
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,675
Ask about me.

686
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,844
His name wasn't B.J.,
but it did sound similar.

687
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:18,014
Anyway, so the next guy I got with,
he was a white guy.

688
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,099
I love white guys. White guys are great.

689
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,267
Fucking awesome.

690
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,937
There's a certain type of white guy
that I love. They are my kryptonite.

691
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,566
You understand that type of white guy
when I say, all malnourished.

692
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,111
The malnourished white guy

693
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,572
with the man bun
and the ukulele for no reason.

694
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,117
The little malnourished vegan.
Malnourished-vegan white guy. Love it.

695
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,037
I like to collect them like Pokémon.
Like, "Gotcha, Ian."

696
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,082
"Gotcha, Brian. Gotcha."

697
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,710
I fucking love it.
I found a rare white guy in the wild.

698
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,464
Little vegan one.
Proper rare, right? And I got him!

699
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:55,468
He was great, lovely. He was so grateful
to be dating a Black girl.

700
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:58,387
But here's the thing why.
He had a Black girl fetish.

701
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,933
Yeah. I knew he had a Black girl fetish.
Just disgusting.

702
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:05,394
I knew he had one
because he called me a Nubian queen.

703
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,480
Ugh!

704
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:10,691
Oh my God, white guys,
don't call Black girls Nubian queens.

705
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,112
Like me calling you Caucasian prince.
Your name's Steve. Okay?

706
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,948
Your name's fucking Steve, Steve.
I'm calling you Steve.

707
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,866
Steve was so grateful to be with me,

708
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,619
but he had a Black girl fetish,
and was a bit kinky.

709
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,246
He was a bit freaky.

710
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,831
He was a bit weird. Okay?

711
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,833
One day he came in from work
and was like…

712
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,045
It's my impression of him,

713
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,340
Oh. Uh. Oh.

714
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,342
Oh-uh.

715
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:37,677
Oh-uh.

716
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,928
"London? Oh!"

717
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,139
"How sexually free are you?"

718
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,059
I was like, "What?"

719
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,477
He was like, "How... How…"

720
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,731
"How sexually free are you?"

721
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,443
I was like, "I got sacked
from a major porn channel

722
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,778
and suck dick for shoes."

723
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,782
"I'm as sexually free as can be.
Right? So there we go."

724
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,826
"I'm sexually free."

725
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,453
"I don't even know
what's with that attitude."

726
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,874
"I'm fucking sexually free."
He was like, "Okay, well,

727
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,002
I just... I just feel like
we should role-play."

728
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,462
"Like… Have... Have...
Have you ever role-played?"

729
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,922
I was like, "No!"

730
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,301
"I'm a Black woman.
The role I'm playing is hard enough."

731
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,344
Have I ever fucking role played?

732
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,471
What the fuck is that shit?

733
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,891
Pretending! Fuck that!

734
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:27,310
This is odd. Okay? He was like,

735
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:31,314
"I just feel like we should role-play,
and I really... I really want to act out

736
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:34,692
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey."</i>

737
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,528
Now here's the thing.

738
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,948
Here's the thing, L.A.
I... I ain't never seen the film.

739
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,243
I haven't read the book
'cause it's fucking beneath me. Okay?

740
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:48,581
It's beneath all of us.
It's fucking trash. Okay?

741
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:51,834
But I am adventurous. I like a challenge.

742
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,004
So I was like, "Fuck it! I'll try it.
What do you have to do?"

743
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:58,382
He was like, "Okay, so, we...
We have to have sex

744
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,510
in the characters of... of the film. Okay?"

745
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,225
"Are you going to do it?
Are you going to do it?"

746
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,560
I was like, "Yeah, sure, I'll do it!"

747
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,562
So he got into character. He was like,

748
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,774
"I'm Christian Grey."

749
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,402
"I'm a white man, and I'm rich.
That means I can abuse you."

750
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,697
I think that's the premise
of the fucking movie. Right?

751
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,033
The premise.

752
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:27,036
Then I have to get into character
as the girl in the movie,

753
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,622
but the girl in the movie
ain't got that much character.

754
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,332
So I was like,

755
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:41,926
"Hi!"

756
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,512
"I'm in the movie too."

757
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,390
"Hi."

758
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,183
"I'm basic."

759
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,604
"I'm basic. I'm gonna...
I'm here. I'm here."

760
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,148
"Okay, what do I do? What do I do?"

761
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,068
And he's like,
"Okay, we have sex in the characters."

762
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,529
"So just get into character, and fuck me!"

763
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,114
I said, "Okay."

764
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:06,325
"It's gonna be great, amazing.
It's gonna be amazing."

765
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,327
So he laid me down, right?

766
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,413
Laid me on the bed, "Are you ready?"

767
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,082
I was like, "Yeah, I'm ready.
I'm ready. Ooh!"

768
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:16,419
"I'm gonna tell my book club
about this. Woo-hoo! It's amazing!"

769
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:20,798
Great!

770
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,509
He said, "Close your eyes."
I closed my eyes.

771
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,136
"Breathe in, breathe out."

772
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,557
Then he counted. "One…

773
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,685
two…

774
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,522
three…"

775
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,940
Ah!

776
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,859
Ah! Ah!

777
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,820
"I'm going to get the whip."

778
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,280
And then he walked out.

779
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,956
Nah!

780
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,624
Whipping for me…

781
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,544
culturally…

782
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,339
it doesn't end well.

783
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,257
I've never been whipped,

784
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,969
but I feel like I've worn the scars of it
on my back my whole life, okay?

785
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,430
So when the white man
went to get the whip…

786
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,144
I realized…

787
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,731
we weren't playing
<i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>.

788
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,778
We were playing <i>12 Years A Slave</i>.

789
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,532
He…

790
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,160
He came out with the whip.

791
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,661
I ran for my life, guys!

792
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,873
I fucking ran. I escaped slavery.

793
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,375
Guys, I escaped slavery.

794
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,793
I did.

795
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,628
I escaped.

796
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,047
I'm here to tell the tale.

797
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,883
After my stint with a slave master,

798
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,261
I realized I was looking for dick
in all the wrong places.

799
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,639
I shouldn't be catching slavery dick.

800
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:55,434
No one should be
catching slavery dick, okay?

801
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,770
I decided to not go out and find the dick.

802
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:01,107
I should just standstill,
and let the dick come to me, okay?

803
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,693
You know it.
So I started doing stand-up comedy!

804
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,195
Yeah!

805
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,572
'Cause here's my thing!

806
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,699
If you can watch me
chat shit for 20 minutes,

807
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,660
you can definitely fuck me, init?

808
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,412
You know it! You know it!

809
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,955
I'm gonna do stand-up comedy.

810
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,749
I started doing stand-up
and was performing in Britain.

811
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,584
I was fucking funny. I killed it.

812
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,546
I was going out on stage
to a mainly white audience,

813
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,630
having a great time.

814
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:27,133
Afterward,
white people came up to me and said,

815
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,052
"Oh my God. You're so funny.
You should go to Edinburgh."

816
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,806
I was like, "Cool."
They were like, "You are so funny."

817
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,474
"You should go to Edinburgh."

818
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,643
-"Cool."
-"You're funny. Go to Edinburgh."

819
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,813
I thought it was a hate crime.
Didn't know there was anything there.

820
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,815
I was like, "You go to Edinburgh!"

821
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:47,278
"I'm from Croydon!
You go to fucking Edinburgh!"

822
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,531
"Fuck off! Don't tell me to go
to Edinburgh! Fucking racist!"

823
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,201
Turns out there's a comedy festival
in Edinburgh. Yeah!

824
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,662
Yeah. The Edinburgh Comedy Festival.

825
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,915
So I went there, and that's where I saw

826
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:04,295
male comics get treated like gods!

827
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:07,298
Male comics get treated like gods
by women, by us,

828
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,467
because we have no sense, ladies.

829
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,137
We have no...
No, we don't. We have no sense. Okay?

830
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,306
I saw these male comics on stage,

831
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:19,143
and I realized
that women will fuck you if you're funny.

832
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,937
You don't have to be good-looking
or have money.

833
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:25,065
But women will fuck you
if you're funny! Okay?

834
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,942
I noticed it with all these comics.

835
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,986
All these comics were telling jokes,

836
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,405
and the women in the audience
were going crazy!

837
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,783
Screaming, laughing,
fluffing up the nani. Going crazy!

838
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,161
Going crazy for these men!

839
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,872
Ready to risk it all
over basic observational skills

840
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,208
on their family dynamic. Right?

841
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,877
And these comics
are on stage chatting shit.

842
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,005
And women in the audience
are lapping it up, lapping it up!

843
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,174
It doesn't work the other way around.

844
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:52,468
Female comics do not get to fuck models.

845
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,387
My dating history
looks like a who's who of Uber drivers.

846
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,891
Okay?

847
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,938
I don't get to fuck models!
Google your favorite male comics.

848
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:08,484
These Daves and Eds,
they're are not fucking Angies and Pattys.

849
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,654
They're fucking Mimis,
and Salanas, and Kombuchas.

850
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:16,033
Otherworldly-wheatgrass-infused bitches.
It's not fair! It's not fair!

851
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,576
'Cause I can't compete, okay?

852
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:21,497
And it's not just like that in Britain.
That shit is universal.

853
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,666
I've seen it here, in America.

854
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,085
I was watching<i> Saturday Night Live.</i>

855
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:30,130
It's a very niche program.
I don't know if you're aware of it.

856
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,424
It's on Saturday nights, and it's live...

857
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,593
It's niche. It's above you, I mean…

858
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,429
It's too highbrow, S<i>aturday Night Live.</i>

859
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,350
I was watching this show
called <i>Saturday Night Live,</i>

860
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:44,270
and there was comics on there
telling jokes.

861
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:48,524
There's this white guy on there,
and God bless him, I would fuck him.

862
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:51,235
'Cause he looks like a charming fum. Okay?

863
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:53,696
His name is Colin Jost. Okay?

864
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:57,283
Anyone here know?
Colin Jost is just gorgeous.

865
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,370
What a chin, jaw. Sexy, fum energy. Right?

866
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,914
And I saw that,
and I thought, "I could fuck him."

867
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,165
"I could fuck him."

868
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,376
I looked at his details,
see what he was saying.

869
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,253
Googled him, went on his Instagram.

870
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:13,507
He is married to Scarlett Johansson.

871
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,052
This average-looking fum-looking white man

872
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:19,346
is married to Scarlett Johansson,

873
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,474
the most beautiful Asian actress
in all of America.

874
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,476
It's not fair!

875
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:26,770
It's not fair.

876
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,523
I couldn't believe it when I saw it.

877
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,067
Look at Pete fucking Davidson.

878
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,361
Pete fucking Davidson.

879
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,364
Fucked Ariana Grande and Kate Beckinsale.

880
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,450
Meanwhile, me, in my current form,

881
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:42,244
I'm not hot enough
to suck Larry David's dick. I'm not.

882
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,623
He'd be like, "No." I'd be like, "No."

883
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:46,874
-"No."
-Agh!

884
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,709
-"Larry."
-"No. No!"

885
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,127
It's not fair!

886
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,339
We live in this world,
and it's not fair for me 'cause…

887
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:57,259
I can't compete with these
otherworldly-wheatgrass-infused bitches.

888
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,804
'Cause I'm not an otherworldly-
wheatgrass-infused bitch. I'm just…

889
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,515
banter and ass, okay?

890
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,935
I'm banter and ass,
and I try and change myself,

891
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,563
exercise and stuff,
work out and get healthy.

892
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,733
And I try and exercise,
work out and get healthy, but I can't.

893
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,110
Because I'm perfect. Okay?

894
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,155
I can't do that shit
'cause I'm fucking perfect.

895
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,033
I can't. I'm perfect. I'm fucking perfect.

896
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:24,119
When I put on weight,
I put on weight in my stomach.

897
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:28,499
So much so that if you go to Google
and type in, "Is London Hughes",

898
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,418
the first thing
that comes up is "pregnant."

899
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,546
My mom showed me that, fucking bitch!
That's the truth.

900
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,966
I put weight on my stomach area.
Some people call this a food baby.

901
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,969
I don't call it a food baby.
I call this a wealth gut.

902
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:44,390
This is a wealth gut.
This means you can afford brunch.

903
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,352
Okay? It's a wealth gut.

904
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,938
Henry VIII had one. I'm fine. Okay?

905
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,607
It's a wealth gut. Ceviche, Taco Tuesday.

906
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,192
It's a wealth gut.

907
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,735
Okay? Fucking wealth gut.

908
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,612
I try to work out.

909
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,198
My friend said,
"Why don't you just work out."

910
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,157
"Just try it."

911
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,744
I got one of those workout DVDs.
I put it in, and this woman,

912
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,872
this high-metabolism bitch,
just staring at me

913
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,292
after you just ate a fucking pizza
or some shit. She's staring.

914
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,336
"Okay, let's work out!"

915
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,964
"Okay? Okay! Okay? Okay!"

916
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:17,881
"And one."

917
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,634
And I'm doing it with her.
I'm just… Hoo! Working out.

918
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,763
After 10 minutes, I have to sit down
and watch it like a film!

919
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,601
Might as well have been <i>Avatar</i>
or some shit. Fantasy shit.

920
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,020
Shit that would never happen in real life.

921
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,940
Fantasy shit. Exercise! Exercise is shit.

922
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,276
Exercise on purpose!

923
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,486
Exercising on purpose.

924
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,740
Running up and down on purpose.

925
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:46,076
Exercise. Working out. Jogging. Jogging.

926
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,412
Running?

927
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,706
Mara... Marathons? Fuck marathons!

928
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:53,959
White privilege is running
even though no one ain't chasing you!

929
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,547
"I'm running, okay?
But I'm not in danger."

930
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,759
"I'm jogging. I'm running.
I'm not in danger."

931
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,844
"There's no one behind me."

932
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,222
"No police, nobody.
But I'm running for fun."

933
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:08,223
Fuck that shit!

934
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,684
Fucking white privilege!

935
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,227
I hate it!

936
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,856
Which means in the world of comedy,

937
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:19,693
I can't fuck comedians because
I'm not hot enough to fuck a comedian.

938
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,780
I'm not even hot enough
to fuck Mr. Bean. Okay?

939
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,866
Honestly, that sounds like a joke,
but it's true.

940
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:29,536
Rowan Atkinson,
who plays Mr. Bean, catches puss.

941
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,622
He catches puss.

942
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,417
Rowan Atkinson stole my mate's girlfriend.
True story.

943
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:39,046
We live in a world
where Mr. Bean can take your gal.

944
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,964
It's fucking crazy!

945
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:45,844
It's hard out here for female comedians.
No one talks about it. It's so hard.

946
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,054
It's so hard for me

947
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,307
because I'm not hot enough
to fuck male comics.

948
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,017
Not really hot enough for that.

949
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,187
But also, I'm above all you civilian men.
So it's just…

950
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,816
What do I do? Do you know what I mean?

951
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,651
I'm above civilian men, but…

952
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:03,904
I try and fuck a civilian guy
at least once a week.

953
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,406
You've got to give back to the community.

954
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,284
I try. Go out there and fuck a civilian.

955
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,538
Ladies, fuck a civilian man.
You gotta try.

956
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:16,708
So I fuck a civilian man, but it's hard
because they don't understand my genius.

957
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,961
I'm a comedy queen.
You have a nine-to-five.

958
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:21,380
I live my best life. You don't understand.

959
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,883
But I tried to fuck this civilian guy,
ladies. This is how it went.

960
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,386
You know when you're fucking a guy.

961
00:47:27,469 --> 00:47:30,722
You finish fucking him,
but for some reason, he's still there.

962
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,726
He's still there, not paying rent.

963
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,437
He's still in your bed.

964
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,399
You fucked him. The fuck was over.
He's... he's still there.

965
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:43,443
I fucked this guy.
He was still there afterwards.

966
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,697
I was five minutes away
from kicking him out of my house

967
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,741
'cause I really needed to fart. Okay?

968
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,035
Men, when you leave, we fart. Okay?

969
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:54,955
And the fart is long and spiritual. Okay?

970
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,417
Oh, shit! Dating will fuck up your colon.

971
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:02,421
Just holding that shit in
since appetizers. I needed to fart. Okay?

972
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:05,215
He's in my bed not paying rent.
I need to fart. Right?

973
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,760
Here's the thing. The sex was shit,
and the sex was shit

974
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,471
because he didn't go down on me properly.

975
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,890
Okay? Innit, you know.

976
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,393
He went down on me,
but he didn't go down on me properly.

977
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:20,314
I wanted him to sea biscuit.
Do you know what I mean?

978
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,651
Sea biscuit, right?

979
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,863
I wanted him to sea biscuit.
He did not sea biscuit me.

980
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,031
Oh, no. He did not.

981
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,909
I wanted… sea biscuit.

982
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,827
He did not sea biscuit. Oh, no.

983
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,871
He disrespected it. Right?

984
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,874
He treated it like a rapper
too scared to battle. He was like…

985
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,617
Are you fucking kidding me?

986
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:16,078
What the fuck is that shit, man?

987
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:19,122
Sea biscuit means deep dive,
go down, find my Nemo.

988
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,791
Find my Nemo!

989
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,502
Deep dive that shit!

990
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,796
Swim in that shit!

991
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,340
Make some fucking memories.

992
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,177
Don't treat it like a rapper
that's too scared to battle.

993
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,388
Men, make some noise.

994
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,140
Okay. Men, you are shit!

995
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,934
That's how you are. You're shit.

996
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,436
You think you can go down
on women properly.

997
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,854
But you fucking can't.

998
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,024
Men cannot go down on women properly.
It's not your fault.

999
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,777
Society has let you get away with it.
It really has.

1000
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,988
Society tells women from the age of eight,

1001
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,323
we got to grow up and suck dick.
We know that.

1002
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,075
Ladies, we know it.

1003
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,785
We grow up and suck dick.

1004
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,747
It's everywhere, in songs, in movies,
in popular culture.

1005
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,792
It's been put in our...
Literally put in our faces.

1006
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,379
We know that at some point,
we're gonna have to suck a dick.

1007
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:09,631
We've got to practice.
I've been practicing.

1008
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,049
We've been practicing.

1009
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,260
When the moment comes,
we know what we're doing.

1010
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,637
Men... Men ain't been told that shit.

1011
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,973
Because going down on women
is not normalized,

1012
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,766
but sucking dick is normalized.

1013
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,269
And it's a fucking joke.
It's a joke, guys.

1014
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,355
I can't take it. It's true. It's true.

1015
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,942
I want sitting on faces
to be normalized like sucking dick.

1016
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,736
I'll prove how it's so normalized.

1017
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:33,405
Listen, imagine you're watching a film.

1018
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:37,034
All of a sudden, you see a car
driving down a long dirt road.

1019
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,827
There's a guy driving the car.

1020
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,622
He's like, "Oh, I'm driving a car,
down a dirt road."

1021
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,833
"Mysterious,
I'm in a movie driving a car."

1022
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,961
Then all of a sudden,
a girl appears from his crotch like…

1023
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:51,798
"I just sucked his dick."

1024
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:53,800
It's perfectly fine.
No one bats an eyelid.

1025
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,136
You never see a woman driving a car…

1026
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:02,517
Ooh! Ooh! All of a sudden,
a man appears from her crotch…

1027
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,898
His face all sweaty, hand to his face.

1028
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,610
You never see it.

1029
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,237
It's not normalized.

1030
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,533
I want sitting on face to be commonplace.
I want to go out on a Friday night

1031
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,453
and look down the alleyway
and not see blow jobs. Oh, no.

1032
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:25,165
I want to see girls sitting on faces,
sitting on faces, sitting on faces.

1033
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,501
Sitting on faces.
Texting their friends, like,

1034
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,961
"Babes, I'm gonna come once I come. Okay?"

1035
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,507
"I'm coming.
Give me two minutes."

1036
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,634
"No teeth!"
That's what I want, right?

1037
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,763
I fucking want that shit.
I want sitting on face to be commonplace.

1038
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,891
I want to see a girl
behind a parked car like this,

1039
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:45,310
and not automatically think she's peeing.

1040
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,272
She's sitting on face.
She's sitting on face.

1041
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,900
I want to use it
as a form of communication.

1042
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:55,195
A guy will be like, "Hello,"
and I'll be like, "Shut up!" Okay?

1043
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:56,530
"I'm sitting on face."

1044
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,783
That is the future I want.
Sitting on face will be commonplace.

1045
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,911
That's the future I want.
That's the Brexit I want.

1046
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:06,706
That's right.

1047
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,375
Sitting on face!

1048
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,962
My manifesto. That's my manifesto.

1049
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:16,133
Here's the thing. I had sex with this guy.
It was shit. I faked an orgasm.

1050
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,761
He didn't go down properly. He's in bed,
not paying rent and I need to fart.

1051
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,346
And he's in bed,

1052
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:23,473
and he wants

1053
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:24,891
to pillow talk.

1054
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,395
Pillow talk is only pillow talk
when you love the person.

1055
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,272
When you don't love the person,

1056
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,898
that is a hot breath chat.

1057
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:36,194
He wanted to hot breath chat with me
in my bed, not paying rent.

1058
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,320
He was like…

1059
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:39,489
"Uh, ugh, uh…"

1060
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:42,200
"What is it you say you do again?"

1061
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:47,372
I was like, "I said…
I said I was a comedian."

1062
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,083
He was like,
"Oh, I thought you were joking."

1063
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:53,503
I was like,
"No, I only do that when I get paid."

1064
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,756
I'm a comedian, right?

1065
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,259
Then he said the one thing
all civilian men say to me

1066
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,969
when I tell them I'm a comedian.

1067
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,346
The one thing all civilian men say

1068
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,973
when I say I'm a comedian.

1069
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:08,351
He said, "You're not going
to put me in a joke, are you?"

1070
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,563
Put you in a joke?

1071
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,316
Put you in a joke?

1072
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:17,819
Because you think I don't have enough
to joke about myself.

1073
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,572
I'm a woman, okay?
I can joke about anything.

1074
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:24,201
I can joke about unequal pay.
I can joke about crazy beauty standards.

1075
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:28,038
I can joke about the fact…
Thank you. Yeah. It's fucking shit.

1076
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:31,791
…I leave my house every morning
knowing full well I could get raped,

1077
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:34,711
but do it anyway
'cause I'm adventurous. Okay?

1078
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,881
I can joke about that,
but you think I'll joke about you?

1079
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:42,594
Me, London Hughes,
the queen of comedy do a joke about you?

1080
00:53:42,677 --> 00:53:45,847
A man, who at dinner when the waiter asks,
"How'd you like your steak?"

1081
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:48,808
replied, "Cooked." Then laugh so hard,
you spat into my mojito!

1082
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:51,394
You think I'd do a joke about you?

1083
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:55,732
Well, yeah.

1084
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,776
And then I put it on Netflix!

1085
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,693
Ha-ha!

1086
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,696
Oh!

1087
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,240
Oh!

1088
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,449
Oh, um… Oh!

1089
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,952
And sorry, I just farted.

1090
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,038
I never saw him again.

1091
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,123
He was a fart-fucking duck. Okay?

1092
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,253
But after he left and the smell cleared,
I thought about my life.

1093
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:19,798
I've had a long dick-catching career.
Twelve years of catching dick.

1094
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,760
Twelve long years of catching dick.
All different types of dick.

1095
00:54:23,843 --> 00:54:26,513
Black dick, white dick,
young dick, old dick.

1096
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,890
All the dicks. Every type of dick. Okay?

1097
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,725
Rich dick, poor dick, royalty dick.

1098
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,687
Royalty dick, seriously. Well, kind of.

1099
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,731
I did a gig. I did a show,
and Prince Charles was there.

1100
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,485
Prince actual Charles. He was there.
Afterward, he came up to me,

1101
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,280
and told me that I was
far too pretty to be a comedian.

1102
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,449
Is that a compliment or an insult?

1103
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,328
I don't know. Fuck it.
The future King of England thinks I'm hot.

1104
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,164
I would've sucked his dick too
if Camilla weren't there.

1105
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,667
I would have done it. I would've curtsied.

1106
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,627
I would've stood there, "Knight me."

1107
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,934
Got me some Meghan Markle money.
I would've fucking done it.

1108
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,353
I would have fucking done it!

1109
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,522
Black princess, I would've done it.

1110
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:20,317
So I nearly fucked Prince Charles. Um…

1111
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,069
Oh, I fucked rich dick, poor dick,

1112
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:26,781
and there was one dick in particular
that changed my whole life.

1113
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:30,368
I'll tell you about this dick. He was
a very important dick to me. Bless him.

1114
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,578
And I'll tell you.

1115
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,789
Recently I did a Facebook quiz.
You know those Facebook quizzes

1116
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,877
where basically you enter the information,
and it tells you who you are.

1117
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,045
You know those?

1118
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:43,840
So I did one of those. Turns out
I'm a middle-class white guy. Right?

1119
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,051
So now that I was
a middle-class white guy,

1120
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,428
I needed to fuck
some middle-class white men.

1121
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,723
So you gotta find them first.
I'll tell you where they all are.

1122
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:55,226
They're all in
the Westfield Shopping Center.

1123
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,605
Go to Westfield Shopping Center
and just walk around.

1124
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,690
A middle-class white guy
will walk up to you.

1125
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:03,777
Even if it's to ask, "What size is this?"
They'll walk up to you.

1126
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,904
So this guy walked up to me.

1127
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:08,198
He was like, "Hey."
And I was like, "Hi, hi."

1128
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,408
And he was an investment banker.

1129
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,452
I don't know what that is.

1130
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,205
But it sounds like money.

1131
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,708
Sounds like, "You're good with numbers.
you should have mine."

1132
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:25,882
Fucking worked. No, it worked.
It worked. It worked. It worked.

1133
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,968
I got his number. He got mine.
We were talking. He was like,

1134
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,305
"I wanna take you on a date tomorrow."
The next day was tomorrow.

1135
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,518
He picked me up outside my house.

1136
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,979
I had a beautiful apartment in Chelsea
'cause I got money in London.

1137
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,358
He pulled up outside my house in…

1138
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,193
a Ferrari!

1139
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:48,530
A real one,
not the little key chain one, the real...

1140
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:51,658
I'd never seen one, a real Ferrari.
He pulled up... vrrr…

1141
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:55,495
in his Ferrari with the windows down,
music blazing, just…

1142
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,164
…in a Ferrari.
My neighbors were like, "Who's that?"

1143
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,376
I'm like, "Fuck off, bitch.
It's not your Uber. It's for me."

1144
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,128
-"Who's that?"
-Mind your business.

1145
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:08,341
So, I come out. I come out, right?
I'm like, "Oh my God, a Ferrari!"

1146
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,927
And I get in the car,
and we're just cruising.

1147
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,138
And it's so beautiful. The sun is shining.

1148
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,014
It's the hottest day of the year.

1149
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,559
We're cruising in a Rari.
I'm living my best life.

1150
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,520
The music's playing,
and I feel like I'm in a music video.

1151
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,398
I'm just like…

1152
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,204
I got too excited. He said,
"Get off the trunk."

1153
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,039
I was like, "Sorry."

1154
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,041
"Sorry, I was twerking on the trunk."

1155
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,503
"I'm sorry."
I got back in the car, and I was like,

1156
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,046
"Honey, where are we going?"

1157
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:50,675
He was like,
"We are going to Hyde Park for a picnic."

1158
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,386
Hyde Park is a beautiful park
in Central London.

1159
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,555
I was like, "Yes! A picnic in the park."

1160
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,266
"Hottest day of the year,
fucking Ferrari. Let's go."

1161
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,101
He drives me to Central London.

1162
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:03,313
He pays for parking in Central London.

1163
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,898
It's expensive.

1164
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,151
He pays for parking. We pull up.
We find a spot in the park.

1165
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,737
He goes like this.
That's not his dick. That's the mat.

1166
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,324
He puts the mat down.
And he brings out this picnic hamper.

1167
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,533
I'm like, "Oh my God!"

1168
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,118
He opens up the picnic hamper,

1169
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,746
and there's so much
expensive food in there, guys.

1170
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:23,124
Honestly,
there was like Whole Foods' food.

1171
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:27,587
Whole Foods. I was eating
upper-middle-class strawberries.

1172
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,340
I was eating cheese
with white girl's names like Brie.

1173
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,508
I fucking...

1174
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:36,429
I fucking made it. Know what I mean?
I was living my best life.

1175
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,724
I'm eating this Brie cheese, and I'm like,
"I'm living my best life."

1176
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:44,479
All I could think of, in that moment,
is that I wanted to fuck him in the park.

1177
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,440
"That's all I want to do.
I want to fuck you in the park."

1178
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,985
"I hope you don't say anything stupid
'cause we're gonna fuck in the park."

1179
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:52,820
I'm thinking how am I gonna fuck him.

1180
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,531
What's the angle, Kama Sutra…

1181
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:55,740
I'm thinking all that.

1182
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,743
He's doing his thing,
I'm like, "It's going to be amazing."

1183
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,579
"We're gonna have the best sex,
the best park sex ever."

1184
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,414
Then all of a sudden,

1185
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:05,124
shit went left.

1186
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,752
He starts sneezing. "Achoo!"

1187
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,380
"Achoo!"

1188
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:12,173
"Achoo!"

1189
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:13,925
"Achoo!"

1190
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,885
Now, allergies are real.

1191
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:19,430
I give him some Claritin
and say, "Shut the fuck up!" Alright?

1192
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:22,016
"Take Claritin, shut up.
You're killing my vibe."

1193
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,685
He's still sneezing. "Achoo!"

1194
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,730
"Achoo!" I'm like, "My God. Are you okay?
Is there something wrong?"

1195
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,649
"Achoo!" Still sneezing, right?

1196
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,234
All of a sudden, he goes pale.

1197
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,486
And he's already white,
so paler than that.

1198
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:39,117
He goes pale, okay?
Then his head starts moving like this.

1199
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,244
He looks a bit woozy,
like he's gonna be sick.

1200
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,788
His hand starts shaking.
I'm like, "Are you okay?"

1201
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,207
"I'm fine." And his voice goes so high.

1202
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,835
He's like, "Achoo! I'm okay."

1203
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,337
All of a sudden, I'm like,
"You don't look so well."

1204
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,215
He vomits on himself
and then passes the fuck out.

1205
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,260
Yeah. Now, here's the thing.

1206
00:59:58,761 --> 00:59:59,762
I'm a Black girl.

1207
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:02,056
He's a half-dead white dude.

1208
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,766
And we're in a park.

1209
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:08,813
I've seen the movie.
This shit does not end well for me. Okay?

1210
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,356
It really doesn't, right?

1211
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,817
So I'm like, "Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!"

1212
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:17,405
He's in and out of consciousness.
"Oh! Oh my God. Bleurp! I'm so sorry."

1213
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,491
I'm like, "What the fuck are you doing?"
"I'm so sorry."

1214
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,535
"I can't do this. Live your best life."

1215
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:25,330
He's like, "No, no. Don...
Bleurp! Don't leave."

1216
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:28,291
I'm like, "How can I help?
Call the police, an ambulance?"

1217
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,585
He's like, "No. If you call an ambulance

1218
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,920
my work will find out and fire me."

1219
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:36,090
I'm like, "What do you want from me?
What is wrong with you?"

1220
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,093
He says, "It's okay. It's...  Bleurp"

1221
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,971
"Oh, God! It's okay. Brrr."

1222
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:45,099
"It's okay. I'm just having… I'm having…

1223
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,477
a methadone comedown."

1224
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:55,652
Methadone

1225
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:57,487
comedown.

1226
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,822
Now, I'm not a druggy person.

1227
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,076
The only thing I sniff is Vicks VapoRub.

1228
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:10,333
So I didn't know
what a methadone comedown was.

1229
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:11,292
Turns out,

1230
01:01:11,376 --> 01:01:15,713
methadone is a drug that they give
recovering heroin addicts.

1231
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:19,967
I found a recovering-heroin-addict
investment banker.

1232
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,470
And I was gonna fuck him in the park.

1233
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:25,640
What are the chances, right?

1234
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,934
I'm like, I can't do this.
Too much for me.

1235
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,061
I've seen <i>Wolf of Wall Street</i>.
Fuck this life.

1236
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:33,648
He was like, "Please, help me."
"I can't help you."

1237
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:36,818
And I couldn't help him. I didn't
pay attention in lifesaving school.

1238
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,529
I didn't know what to do.
I can't do the recovery position.

1239
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:41,823
"Can I offer doggy style?"
That's all I could do.

1240
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:43,783
"Sit on your face? What do you want?"

1241
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:45,243
He's like, "Help me."

1242
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,245
"Bleugh!" "What can I do for you?"

1243
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,414
"You need to... Bleurp! You need to... Uh…"

1244
01:01:49,497 --> 01:01:53,126
"You need to... Bleurp!
You need to drive me home."

1245
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:56,963
"Drive…

1246
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:58,631
the Rari?"

1247
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:03,177
-"Yeah, can you drive?"
-"I played Mario Kart."

1248
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,389
It's doable. It's doable.

1249
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:09,600
He said,
"I just live 10 minutes away in Pimlico."

1250
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:13,479
"Just drive me home, please.
It won't take long to drive me home."

1251
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:14,981
I was like, "I can do this."

1252
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,901
So I bundled this half-dead white dude
into the Ferrari, right?

1253
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,279
I get in the Ferrari.
Now, here's the thing.

1254
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,531
I know we're in a rush.
It was an emergency,

1255
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:25,533
but I was going as slow as I can

1256
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:28,828
'cause bitches need to see me
in a Ferrari.

1257
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,455
Yeah!

1258
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,207
That's right! That's right!

1259
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,375
I made it.

1260
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:38,087
I've got a half-dead white dude
in the car, but I'm in a Rari, okay?

1261
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,381
I took the long way around. I hit traffic.

1262
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:44,051
It felt like I was in a parade.
I was just, "Yes. Yes."

1263
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,845
Eh, eh, eh, eh.

1264
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:48,389
Ignore the half-dead white dude. Eh!

1265
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:49,807
"I'm in a Rari."

1266
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,144
I got to his house
about four and a half hours later.

1267
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,646
Four and a half hours later.

1268
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,151
We pull up outside his house.
I helped him up. He goes up the stairs,

1269
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,029
and his house is fucking beautiful.
Seven mill, easy.

1270
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,948
Fucking money, right?
I'm walking around the house, like,

1271
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,534
"Oh shit! If he dies,
maybe there's a will."

1272
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:12,622
Know what I mean?
Silver lining or some shit. Who knows?

1273
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,000
He goes straight to the bathroom,
closes the door. I'm standing outside,

1274
01:03:16,083 --> 01:03:17,710
trying not to steal shit, right?

1275
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:22,924
He's in the bathroom for five minutes.
He comes out like nothing ever happened.

1276
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,133
He comes out, like…

1277
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,640
"You're special."

1278
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,518
I'm like, "What the fuck?"

1279
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,062
He was like,
"You're special. Sorry about that mishap."

1280
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:36,979
"Mishap?"

1281
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,774
"Mishap? I was almost on <i>Cops."</i>

1282
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:41,275
"What do you mean 'mishap'?"

1283
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:44,111
-"Hey, hey, hey, calm down."
-"I'm not gonna calm down."

1284
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,405
"I was eating
fucking Brie cheese one minute,

1285
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:48,825
next minute,
I'm driving you home. You're half-dead."

1286
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,202
"You're alive!
Okay, great! What the fuck?"

1287
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:53,454
He was like,
"Chill. You're being too much."

1288
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,250
Too much.

1289
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:01,337
Then he said,
"Let's get back to where we left off,"

1290
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,922
and starts kissing my neck.

1291
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:05,675
My vagina left my body.

1292
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,679
Left it.

1293
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:14,350
I was having an out-of-body experience.
I was out-of-body. "Oh my God."

1294
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:15,893
"Oh my God."

1295
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:19,480
After all that, this guy still thinks
he can fuck me. Oh my God.

1296
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:23,192
I need to carry myself
with all the confidence of a mediocre man.

1297
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,235
Oh my God.

1298
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:26,320
Oh my God.

1299
01:04:26,404 --> 01:04:28,114
And I'm thinking to myself, "Wow."

1300
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,032
"Okay. Okay."

1301
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,952
"You may be 31. You may be single."

1302
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,538
"But at least
you're not that loser, okay?"

1303
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:39,417
"And if he still can get women,
then you are not the problem here, okay?"

1304
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,169
"And maybe,
maybe he thinks you're too much,

1305
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:46,382
but if he thinks you're too much,
then that's because he's just not enough."

1306
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:48,050
Right?

1307
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,221
Ladies…

1308
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:57,184
Ladies, I was in a new horizon.
New ho-rizon.

1309
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,937
Ho-rizon, okay?

1310
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,941
For the first time in my life,
I did not want to fuck him.

1311
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,861
My mind was open,
but my vagina was closed.

1312
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:10,573
I didn't wanna fuck him. I felt good.
I was like, "I'm better than this."

1313
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,450
"I'm a fucking queen, don't need this."

1314
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:16,871
"I'm London Hughes, and I'm gonna be fine
with my single ass anyway. I got this."

1315
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,247
I was ready to storm off.

1316
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:20,666
He didn't know
that I was having an epiphany.

1317
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,169
He was still wanking over my leg.

1318
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:26,088
He was wanking
like Louis C.K. in a green room.

1319
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:28,883
Wanking over my leg at the time, right?

1320
01:05:28,966 --> 01:05:30,843
He had no idea
I was having this epiphany.

1321
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:33,471
I broke free from his embrace.
I said, "Fuck that noise!"

1322
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,640
I stormed out of his house
with all the power

1323
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,600
of a thousand destiny's children.

1324
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:40,311
He ran after me, "Are we not fucking?"

1325
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:42,396
I was like, "No, no, no, no, no!"

1326
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,193
"If we're not fucking, at least let me
give you some money for a cab home."

1327
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:48,235
I was like, "Okay."

1328
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:53,908
He gave me £300 for a cab
ten minutes back to my house in Chelsea.

1329
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,201
Ladies and gentlemen,

1330
01:05:55,701 --> 01:05:57,203
I looked at that money.

1331
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,120
Ugh!

1332
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:01,040
And I did what any self-respecting

1333
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:03,709
feminist-queen-comedy icon

1334
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,586
called London Hughes would do.

1335
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:08,923
I sat on his face,
and I bought some shoes.

1336
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:11,008
Thank you!

1337
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,762
Oh my God!

1338
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:17,181
Thank you so much, guys.

1339
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,601
This has been <i>To Catch a Dick</i>.

1340
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:22,770
Thank you.

1341
01:06:22,853 --> 01:06:26,232
Can I just say... Can I just say,
you've been fucking great.

1342
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,901
Everything I've said
on this stage is 100% true.

1343
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,487
Men, if you saw that
and you still want to fuck me,

1344
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,488
my DMs are open.

1345
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:34,532
I'm trying to catch a dick.

1346
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:35,574
Thank you!

1347
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:40,496
I'm so dead!

1348
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:45,710
Thank you!

1349
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,213
You're special.

1350
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:50,673
Thank you so much.
