Nostalgia, as per requirment

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,840
And a pinch of happyness

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,960

00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,120
a carefully assorted platter
of raw but delicate jokes

45
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,120
skilfully assembled with
great care and precision from

46
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,000
thinly sliced observations
caught from the sea of

47
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,160
existence of humanity on
planet earth that leaves your

48
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,440
soul feeling cheerful, happy, content and light.

49
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,160
Ladies and gentleman please put your
hands together for Biswa Kalyan Rath

50
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,840
How are you?

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
How are you? How are you?

52
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,640
Good evening!

53
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,600
I accept.

54
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,080
I love living in India, it truly is fun

55
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,360
because in theory one can use
unlimited data here

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,040
but in practice,
there is no signal ever!

57
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
In other countries, people call each
other and say, "Hello! How are you?"

58
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,840
Not in India.

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
In India people call and say,
"Hello, can you hear me?"

60
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,440
Hello, hello, hello.

61
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,320
Then the change of hand maneuver,
"Hello!"

62
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,640
Can you hear me now?"

63
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,680
Then, they change their vocal tone,
"Hello, hello..."

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,480
Hello, hello.

65
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,760
Hello, hello, hello.

66
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,280
Do you think you are in network
but you are out of tune?

67
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,600
As if Vodafone has Anu Malik
and Jawed Akhtar seated in their office.

68
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,640
That's it!

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,840
We are unable to approve you vocal tone.

70
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,480
You say, hello.

71
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,840
He says, "Your tone doesn't have the right."

72
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,680
"Your signal can't go to Mumbai."

73
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Practise and try again.

74
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,920
There is just no signal.

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,160
You say hello,
they say hello and the call disconnects.

76
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,640
Then what you do?

77
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,240
You call back,
they call back at the same time.

78
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,320
No body wants to wait

79
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,560
and then the line is
busy on both the ends

80
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Amazing technology

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,400
if two people want to talk
to each other, they won't allow it.

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,080
Best case scenario is now
the worst case scenario

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,680
And then, both the callers wait for
10 minutes for the other to call

84
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,640
They'll call, they'll call.

85
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,440
Ten minutes later, again both of them
will call each other the same time

86
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,600
Now you've synced up

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,480
You say I'll not call again,
they say I'll not call again...

88
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,320
Half hour later, they call again
but you miss their call,

89
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,600
you call and they miss your call

90
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,120
This goes on for 15 days

91
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,400
On the 15th day you call and ask,
"Brother you'd called?"

92
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,840
"Yes brother, Happy Birthday"

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,440
The signal is so bad.

94
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
The signal is so bad,

95
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,120
that it takes the fun out of
scaring and threatening people.

96
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,000
Say you call,
"Bastard, I will rip your throat apart."

97
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Hello

98
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,320
Hello

99
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,680
Bastard!, Hey bastard!

100
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,200
Hello, Hello

101
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:23,720
Hold a second

102
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,680
Hello

103
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,800
Hello, Hello.

104
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,800
Yes, listen.

105
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,560
Can you hear me?

106
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,320
Hold a second

107
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,080
Listen, I will rip your throat...hello!

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,080
Not road, throat!

109
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,520
Hold on.
Let me text you.

110
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,360
Now you're texting,
I-Will-Rip-Your-Throat-Apart.

111
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,400
The signal is so bad, dude.

112
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,440
if you call yourself

113
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,160
if you dial your own number

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,720
it shows you as busy.

115
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,520
Could you be more free?

116
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,000
Here, we find

117
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,280
unconventional solutions to everything.

118
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,840
I was on the expressway, on the highway,

119
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,320
there I saw a sign board

120
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,720
Accident prone area

121
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,760
It was written, 'Accident Prone Area'

122
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,160
I said, we didn't elect
the government for disclaimers

123
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,680
If you know this place is accident prone,

124
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
then do something!

125
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,400
Why this heart to heart?

126
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,080
I know this area is accident prone

127
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,560
a truck is on its back right there.

128
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,680
Surely, it's not waiting for
a belly rub, "Hey, please, please."

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,280
Accident prone area.

130
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,360
What should I do with this information?

131
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,800
Set up a tent and eat popcorn.

132
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,280
Bro, the accident is just
about to happen, look, look.

133
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,840
Here he comes, the truck driver.

134
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,360
Plain nonsense these signs.

135
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,520
I was on my way to the airport

136
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
At the terminal,
a guy was at the check-in counter

137
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,680
checking-in people

138
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Behind him is a sign,
"Do not pay bribe."

139
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,680
Every other government tells
their employees,

140
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,960
"Don't ask for a bribe."

141
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
Our government is too smart

142
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,480
"Our employee is honest,
but these customers are unlawful"

143
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,720
They just won't stop bribing,
these people.

144
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,040
You know, how we people are.

145
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,040
We keep two thousand rupees handy
every time we step out of our homes.

146
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,120
And don't return till we have bribed it.

147
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,240
Our mothers won't serve us dinner!

148
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,680
Knock, Knock.

149
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,040
Who is there?

150
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,640
Passport office.

151
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,400
Please take bribe.

152
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,520
Oh, that we don't take.

153
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,640
Come on sir,

154
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,320
you can atleast accept 1900.

155
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,360
Nonsensical signboard.

156
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,160
I saw a sign board on the station, once.

157
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,280
The sign board said,

158
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,880
'Beware of pickpockets'

159
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,880
I was like, "How good is this pickpocket"

160
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,560
that department of police has given up.

161
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,400
Surely, these guys would've tried.

162
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,760
"Take your riffles,
today we catch the pickpocket."

163
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,040
"Sir, he robbed those too."

164
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,400
"What can we do?"

165
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,960
Right behind, the pickpocket has strapped
the seven rifles and is firing away.

166
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,400
Like Terminator.

167
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,560
Anyway, what a condescending
attitude is this?

168
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Do not pay bribe.

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,000
Sorry.

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
Beware of pickpockets.

171
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,760
What do you think?
We are not aware of pickpockets?

172
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,560
Like what?

173
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,560
What is this accusation?

174
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,280
Are we roaming around with
our wallets on display?

175
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,040
♫ Come and take it, take it ♫

176
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,840
Anyone here!

177
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,120
The one who'll rob my heart?

178
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
I love it dude.

179
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,840
We..

180
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,040
we have innovative solutions
to every problem, here.

181
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,160
I saw an advertisement, it said,

182
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,280
'Think equity, think Motilal Oswal.'

183
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,320
Have you seen this?

184
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,480
It says, think equity,
think Motilal Oswal

185
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
and they've left it without
a conclusion to that statement.

186
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,520
So I have been thinking since.

187
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,880
I woke up early morning, 4 AM to piss,
I was still thinking.

188
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,800
What would be Motilal
doing at this hour?

189
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,400
Would he be taking a piss too?

190
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,760
Has his equity picked up or fallen?

191
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,360
What is this half advertisement?

192
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,760
This is like half magic trick.

193
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,600
If you're walking by and someone asks,
"Would you like to see some magic?"

194
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,280
You will say, "Sure."

195
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,960
They say, "Think of a number."

196
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,560
You thought of it.

197
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,120
"Think of another number."

198
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,680
You thought of it, too.

199
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,400
"Okay then, bye."

200
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,760
Do something about these numbers?

201
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,880
They are haunting my brain...

202
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,880
37 and 45?

203
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,800
"Son, what will you have for dinner?"

204
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,840
"37 and 45."

205
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
These magicians.

206
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,080
The ones who do number magic,
they piss me off.

207
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,280
They always come and tell you
to think of any number between 1 to 100.

208
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,240
And like an idiot,

209
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
we always think of integers.

210
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,800
They haven't specified integers.

211
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,960
You can think of whatever you want.

212
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,240
Whenever I am asked
to think of any number between 1 to 100

213
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,400
I say, "Pi by two."

214
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,360
If they ask for another number,
its "Epsilon by three."

215
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
"Now add the two numbers."

216
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
"Hand me a scientific calculator.

217
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,120
Don't look!

218
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,280
One second, I've made a mistake.

219
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes, now tell me."

220
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
"Now, I'll guess the number."

221
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,800
"You will guess the number, Ok."

222
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,520
"Till how many decimal digits?"

223
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,680
"Is it not 64?"

224
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,240
"Ha...

225
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,040
No!"

226
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,320
In our country,
advertisements are stuffed randomly

227
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,520
when we are watching the world cup.

228
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,360
Just when the bowler is about to bowl...

229
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,360
I love this one

230
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,160
When the bowler is about to bowl

231
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,720
But these people are trying
to randomly stuff in an advertisement.

232
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,720
And the advertisement is cut in between

233
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,720
problem is, some advertisements
you cut them in middle

234
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
and the wrong message
reaches the audiences.

235
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,320
I was watching an advertisement,
in that,

236
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,440
"Friend, have you invested
in mutual funds?"

237
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,200
They have no pretext or anything

238
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,600
On the street...

239
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,400
"Friend, have you invested
in mutual fund?"

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,360
He says,
"No dude, what if I invest today

241
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,960
and the market falls tomorrow, then?"

242
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,520
There is risk involved in mutual fund...

243
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Cut to Bumrah running

244
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
What did the countrymen learn?

245
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,760
That don't invest in mutual fund,
remove it, remove it...

246
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,360
Yes please remove all of my money,

247
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,880
the Indian government has declared
that mutual funds are risky...

248
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,040
Yes I have read the guidelines sir.

249
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,920
I realized after visiting a foreign
country that construction can end

250
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,080
You guys will totally freak out, guys.

251
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,800
The country is already made,

252
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,480
not under construction like this...

253
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,080
You know what people
do in the metro there?

254
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,480
They sit inside.

255
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
they aren't happy seeing the pillar...

256
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,040
It is being made.

257
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,920
No no, they sit inside and go. Oh!!

258
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,240
Yes some travellers

259
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,000
India is developing country,
always developing

260
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,720
Randomly someone on the street

261
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,680
will be making something using bricks,
stones and cement

262
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,480
We cannot fully develop.

263
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,320
As we develop on one side, on the other
hand under development is going on

264
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,960
If one road is made,
then what do we do sir?

265
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,320
Let's dig.

266
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,680
Please do the honours.

267
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
You will sleep in Koramangala
and wake up in Mohenjodaro

268
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,680
Amazingly dug up!
My heart goes, 'Harappa'.

269
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
This joke is worth INR 500.

270
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,120
People are revising their
history books... what was this joke?

271
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,240
After digging, after digging
when they make something...

272
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,800
they make it weird...

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600
In India, footpaths are made considering
no one has friends in the world.

274
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,120
You cannot walk side
by side on Indian footpath.

275
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,520
If you comfortably walk like this,

276
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,680
your friend will have to walk like this.

277
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,120
His friend will be walking like this.

278
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,120
And everything else in the country.....

279
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,600
the divider is broader
than the footpath.

280
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,360
The divider is broader
than the footpath.

281
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,720
Cows, goats, all stand on the divider.

282
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,200
They say, "There's no
space to stand on the footpath.

283
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,120
Brother,
there you've to stand like this."

284
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,280
"We'll suffer slip disc.

285
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,040
We won't go there."

286
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,280
Ours.....We are developing
country so our manhole has a cover too

287
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
but which is kept aside.

288
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,160
Our government gives
us a chance to be Super Mario.

289
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,880
You....

290
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,960
You want to see the underground level,
you can have a look.

291
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,480
You move along..
[game show background score]

292
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,320
Collecting gold coins underground.

293
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,000
Eating mushroom, kicking turtles...

294
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,320
The footpath will be 6 inches

295
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,960
with an 18-inch tree in between.

296
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,040
Is this the tree you must save?

297
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,400
All other trees around it were cut.

298
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,960
This tree has to be saved, brother.

299
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,920
Between the footpath right?

300
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,520
It's fun...

301
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,120
Why is this tree saved?
Says, "We'll get shade from it."

302
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,760
You won't get shade
if it's planted on the side.

303
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,000
When it rains, you hold
the umbrella on the side right?

304
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,160
You don't stick it right inside?

305
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
Brother, please give 'Bisibelle bhath'

306
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,640
In Bangalore, people don't have bathtub.

307
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,680
They have bisibelle bathtub.

308
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,920
Having a shower in the bath

309
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:56,920
I love it dude.

310
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,560
It's so good in India

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,760
Footpath....

312
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Footpath in other countries

313
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,280
The definition of a footpath is...

314
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,720
A footpath, a footpath, a footpath goes
down, is narrow and bends like this.

315
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,600
India doesn't have anything like this

316
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,200
is a footpath, this is a footpath and
in the end we have no clue what it is

317
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,880
What is this?

318
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,920
Is it garbage?

319
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,360
A tea stall and then footpath

320
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,640
Even if you escape all this
and are walking on a footpath

321
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
The tea stall owners want a clean India

322
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,680
but not by sweeping...

323
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,080
Just a second before you leave,

324
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,160
they will throw a mug of water,

325
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,560
like a bouncer by a Pakistani bowler,

326
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,840
You are walking like Super Mario

327
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,040
Ohh chooo

328
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,000
Impromptou face pack..

329
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,880
Multani soil ...

330
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,720
No pimples thereafter.

331
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,680
We still pretend that there
are rules and regulations here.

332
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,640
Till now we are unable
to stand in a queue, dude.

333
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,400
When you're at the
airport waiting to board,

334
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
without turning around,
you can tell who is standing behind you.

335
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,120
Because he will come till here

336
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,400
And he has no shame,
he will turn and start talking to you.

337
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,120
Is this flight going to Mumbai?

338
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,520
Yes sir, you have managed
to enter my soul

339
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,120
Another guy from here,
"Hey, what's the score?"

340
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,120
You guys think Raavan had ten heads?
No.

341
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,800
Ten people were talking.

342
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,800
Then you are stuck,
come on guys, boarding.

343
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,440
They started living together after that

344
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,240
They are unable to stand in a line.

345
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,080
People on the road
start screaming randomly.

346
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,560
You are walking on the street
and someone starts screaming ...

347
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,480
[Imitates scream]

348
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
And everyone will turn.

349
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,800
And ask, did you call me?

350
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
No no, that guy Rohit.

351
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,240
When you know his name,

352
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,160
then use it dude.

353
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,240
That's the reason people
are assigned names,

354
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,920
so we don't have to yell

355
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,760
and then choose the
person we want to talk to.

356
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,560
This happens on the streets only.

357
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,840
This behaviour is
exclusive to the streets.

358
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,280
Have you seen this
in a boardroom meeting?

359
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,360
That the CEO has spoken, hey!

360
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,400
I am the MD and I would like to add...

361
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,080
In this country, we are just unable
to form a proper queue on the street...

362
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,960
However, here we still have
the yellow light at the traffic signal.

363
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,560
Who is not ready?

364
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Who says that once green
comes after red, a fear creeps in?

365
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,440
Give us a little bit of buffer.

366
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,240
Sir, two primary colour back to back...

367
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,240
No no no...

368
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,960
If a little yellow appears,
to start the car.

369
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,600
If you stop at the red light,
people shout here.

370
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,960
Someone stopped at the red light...

371
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,520
One of my friend's was driving
and she stopped at the red light...

372
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,400
Two people on a scooty
started heckling her.

373
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,360
And just look at their audacity,

374
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,000
"Hey, Mother Teresa, move on."

375
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,960
I said, "What about me sir?"

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,160
"What a wonderful person you are,
the way you speak."

377
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,600
There is so much redundancy here,
for everything.

378
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,520
So much redundancy...

379
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,560
We have a switch for the fan,

380
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,160
a regulator as well and
the regulator has a zero as well.

381
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,480
Enjoy...

382
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,560
If some uncle wants to experiment,

383
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,120
to know if Faraday's
claim is true or not.

384
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,760
Switch on the fan,
switch off the regulator and check.

385
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,320
People are doing it, it's not working...

386
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,040
He was telling the truth...

387
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,160
The reading on a fan regulator is...

388
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,280
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

389
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,440
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

390
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,800
This isn't accurate on any scale.

391
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,120
Use any...Linear scale,
algorithmic scale,

392
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,040
I'll tell you the actual reading.

393
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,000
It should be 0, 0.1., 0.2, 79...

394
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,040
Perfect cooling....and
let's be adventurous today.

395
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,600
I don't understand
why the fan has 5 and 1.

396
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,360
Who switches on the fan at 1?

397
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,000
I switched on the fan at 1.

398
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,720
The fan itself doesn't work at 1.

399
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,160
If you switch on the fan at 1,
the fan will blurt out [Grunts]

400
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,680
[Gibberish]

401
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
If you switch it on at 2,
the fan will work, but sarcastically.

402
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,040
The fan will work,
but

403
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,520
Get married, son...

404
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,520
You're a fan.

405
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,840
Why are all table fans in India

406
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
kept on chairs?

407
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,280
Table fan doesn't have an ambition.

408
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:58,920
It's happy sitting on a chair.

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,760
Doesn't want to move up in life.

410
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,960
Except the owner,
the table fan cools everyone else.

411
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,560
If you own a table fan,
and have called guests home,

412
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,160
it will give breeze to all....

413
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,920
And brother, how are you?

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,360
Good?

415
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:08,880
You too good?

416
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,920
Get lost..

417
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,080
I'm your owner, I'm sitting here

418
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,960
I pay your bills,

419
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,920
and you serve everyone else except me?

420
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,520
Sometimes, while sleeping,
you keep the table fan facing you.

421
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,480
You wake up next morning, the
table fan is facing outside the window.

422
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,040
It will turn to look at you and say,
"Isn't the world so beautiful?"

423
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,280
Let's live it up.

424
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,760
In other countries,
you open the tap, water will pour out.

425
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,600
Now what will I do all day?

426
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,400
India is very excited about the tap,

427
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,080
Anything can happen now.

428
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,280
Anything can happen.

429
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,080
There will be one tap, when you open it,

430
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,000
Before water comes, the tap
itself will come out in your hand.

431
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,240
Father can't open
a jam bottle but son...

432
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,760
Father, I can tackle the
plumbing with my left hand.

433
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,960
Be careful about how you treat me, okay?

434
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,840
I am not Gangadhar, I am Shaktimaan.

435
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,800
Alright, seems like some
Gangadhars in the crowd.

436
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,720
He fits it back.

437
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,040
There's another tap,

438
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,000
you turn it for 90 degrees
and nothing comes out

439
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,840
You are obviously curious...

440
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,280
You will stuff your
beautiful face in there

441
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,120
And one more degree [Gestures water]

442
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,240
Yesterday's dirt and water
will all come gushing out.

443
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,760
Face pack number two.

444
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,680
No pimples for years.

445
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,080
One tap is like a relationship.

446
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,560
Easy to start,
and if you try to turn it off...

447
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,760
It will...

448
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,560
It will take seven births and
the crying and wailing will not stop.

449
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,480
You turn it on,
I love you, I love you, I love you...

450
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,880
Stop it, stop it [Screams]....

451
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,440
Quiet...

452
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,440
When you go for a bath,
there are two taps

453
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,600
One for hot water and
another for cold.

454
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,200
You just can't remember which is which

455
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,560
[Gibberish]

456
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,480
[Screams]

457
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,040
Then you will stick one leg
out and stand for half an hour.

458
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,160
I bathe for two minutes and
my leg bathes for half an hour everyday.

459
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,120
It has experienced all possible
temperatures, there's no hair on it.

460
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,080
Is all cleared.

461
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,760
Sometimes my shower releases vapour

462
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
Mixing, mixing, mixing...

463
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,120
When it's normal temperature, you think

464
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,240
oh ho, water is ready for consumption

465
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,160
Till the time you face the shower,
everything will be fine.

466
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,640
As soon as you turn,
the shower can see...

467
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,880
As soon as you turn, the shower says...

468
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,040
The lad has turned, open up the volcano.

469
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,600
Let's do some Dracarys!

470
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,200
Cold cold water...[Screams]

471
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,640
You have burnt me dude.

472
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,920
That's why Indians maybe fair,
but they are always dark in the groin.

473
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,320
1/3 is laughing,
1/3 is clapping, 1/3 is hiding face.

474
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,280
You too, yes you too, yes all of us.

475
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,680
People in other countries are one shade,

476
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,560
white, white, white, brown,
brown, brown, black, black, black.

477
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,200
Indians are brown,
pitch black and brown.

478
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,880
Looks like God has welded
different parts and made us.

479
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,080
Upper body comes from one factory
while the lower body comes from another.

480
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,360
God says, "Hey dude,
get me a cup of tea." Take him away!

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,520
Here's a footpath, you fall.

483
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,240
Oh man, India manages
to surprise you everyday.

484
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,680
I had gone for a vacation to Lonavala,
there's a place called Tiger point.

485
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,640
Okay.

486
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,360
I'm expecting at least
one cat will be there.

487
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,080
And who do I find there?

488
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,000
Humidity 97 percent,

489
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,440
greenery, you know who was
standing on top of the mountain?

490
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,480
Camel was standing there.

491
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,920
Camel...

492
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,880
Could this animal be further
removed from its natural habitat?

493

Picked up from the desert and
dropped in the midst of greenery...

been created by evolution

so that it can survive
months on end without water...

496
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,360
it is standing in 97 percent humidity.

497
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,400
Can carry civilization on its shoulders

498
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,160

from Africa to Mongolia...

499
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,680
For 20 rupees he is taking
the crying child to the candy store.

500
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,160
The camel's monthly expenses can be met
with the tears the little kid is shedding.

503
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,720
The camel must be so depressed man.

504
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,720
On top of the mountain he must
be thinking everyday, "Should I jump?"

505
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,960
Was giving everyone
sad melancholic looks.

506
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,520
The friend was taking photos
of the camel to upload on Instagram.

507
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,760
The camel must be so sad and depressed.

508
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,760
Instead of 20 litres of water
he must be storing Old Monk in his hump.

509

Seeing a construction site...

510
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,240
if he sees sand at a construction site,
he misses his home.

511
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,200
He must be thinking,

512
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,440
we used to have such awesome
parties in the Jaipur desert,

513
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,360
♫ It's all barren, it's all barren. ♫

514

This joke is for me.

516
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,240
I love Indian households.

517
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,720
We have such things in our households...

518
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,160
Like an Indian refrigerator
can hold anything, just anything.

519
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,200
I have never seen anybody go to a
refrigerator and come back disappointed.

520
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,520
Whatever you bring,
there's always place for it.

521
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,960
If you bring an elephant also,

522
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,880
your mom will say, "Hey, move
the chillies a little and he'll fit."

523
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,600
You'll wonder how.

524
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Just shove and push it a little.

525
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,080
You will move it, elephant
will fit in and sit comfortably.

526

No problem at all, people will
stuff anything in their refrigerators.

00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm telling you.
My mom is mad. She knows nothing.

535
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,840
My mom has been living
in the same house for 30 years

536
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,840
and she still doesn't understand...

537
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,040
that sound does not travel
from the kitchen to the bedroom.

538
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,160
And she's not even trying some new ways.

539
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,120
In the same tone everyday...

540
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,240
We start to watch
the match...as soon as...

541
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,240
as soon as you sit
down to watch the match...

542
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,480
Mom will remember something.

543
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,840
As soon as you switch on the TV...
[Gibberish]

544
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,040
Everyone ignores the first time.

545
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,440
Thinking mom will figure out on her own.

546
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,880
Nobody goes in the first time.

547
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,120
Everyone trusts mom that much

548
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,000
Forget it man...

549
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,040
She does it everyday, she will do it.

550
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,560
Second time again...

551
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,200
[Gibberish]

552
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,160
You put the TV on mute.

553
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:04,920
What are you saying, mom?

554
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,920
[Gibberish]

555
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,640
You get up to go see what she's saying.

556
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
You reach the kitchen,
mom what have you been saying?

557
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,960
Mummy is passive aggressive, "Nothing."

558
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,240
You are like,
how did "nothing" change to

559
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,200
ayee lelalayl lay
lelelelele when we heard it?

560
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,320
Then you also turn passive aggressive,
you turn...

561
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,800
If there is nothing, then it's okay.

562
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,240
Then mom sends a message through you...

563
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,680
Dangerous message...

564
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,800
"Tell your father,
to make food on his own."

565
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,000
"Huh, you can convey
that message yourself."

566
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,720
"He's my father not my husband."

567
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,440
"Okay?"

568
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,320
Tell your father,
to make food on his own.

569
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,240
I will have to bear the
brunt of this news, right?

570
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,960
Father does not understand,
that the messenger is not at fault...

571
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,720
You...Why did you have to
come and tell me...Take that...

572
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,400
My mom's a magician.

573
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,400
She does odd things.

574
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,400
My mom has cast a spell
on all the things in the kitchen.

575
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,000
Only she is able to spot things.

576
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,120
And to check her magic,
she keeps sending us in.

577
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,800
You'll go in, the stuff
is right in front of your eyes,

578
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,760
but you won't be able to see it.

579
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,120
You...

580
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,560
You see it, what do you call this?
I can't understand...

581
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,760
Mom asks, "What can you see?"

582
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,360
One spherical yellow thing

583
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,680
"It's called a lemon."

584
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,640
Yes!

585
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,520
"Found the lighter?"

586
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,640
No...Lighter is not here at all.

587
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,240
"It's right there."

588
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,120
Not here...

589
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,400
Then your mom will come and say,
"It's right there."

590
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,000
You ask her, where?

591
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,080
You turn and realize it's right there!

592
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,080
You say, dude, how is this happening?

593
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,800
My mom does one thing brilliantly...

594
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,840
And no one in this world can do it.

595
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,480
Dust...My mom's enemy is dust.

596
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,880
When my mom enters a room...

597
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Dust panics and flies away.
From far.

598
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,160
They clean themselves up.

599
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,240
Mom enters a room...

600
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,200
dust just evaporates
from the window and places.

601
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,280
Bye guys

602
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,400
Early morning it's swirling around

603
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,160
With the first ray of sunshine,
let's dance...okay.

604
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,560
You guys thought...

605
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,680
Dust is everywhere
in India...everywhere.

606
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,600
You guys thought there's no dust here?

607
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,520
Switch on the light.

608
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,600
Everywhere...see this...see this

609
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
[Stomps feet]

610
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,320
Go...

611
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,040
won't go...till mom doesn't show up,
this just won't go.

612
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,320
Pay whoever you want.

613
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,160
There's so much dust dude,
so much dust in our houses...

614
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,480
I asked my friend,
where does this dust come from?

615
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,720
He said, "Dust is mostly dead skin."

616
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,720
That means, I am dust.

617
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:08,920
This is me.

618
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,120
I am paying my maid
to throw me out of my house.

619
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,880
Lights back...

620
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,080
You felt so amazing right, suddenly?

621
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,200
You guys weren't expecting
a science experiment to happen here.

622
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
I had gone to a foreign country...

623
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,560
And there I realized, that we Indians...

624
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,880
Purchase only cheap goods.

625
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,560
From everywhere.

626
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,280
Spoilt our name.

627
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,000
Foreigners think that we are cheap.

628
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,720
I am changing this perception.

629
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,640
I am changing this perception fully.

630
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,400
I go to most expensive stores...

631
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,240
Ask for the most expensive stuff,
and when they show it to me...

632
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,080
I'm not impressed.

633
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,400
In Japan I visited a store...

634
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,240
Asked, do you have any expensive wine?

635
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,760
And they showed me, "20,000 dollar wine."

636
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,480
"Very nice."

637
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,920
I told them, "I said expensive..."

638
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,280
So they said, "This is expensive."

639
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,440
I said, "This expensive in Japan?"

640
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,200
"In India, beggar drink this."

641
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Totally screwed with them dude...

642
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
"Okay, sorry."

643
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
I said, no problem,
forget it, it's okay...

644
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,640
I was leaving,
and they were discussing...

645
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,080
"Indian economy booming."

646
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,440
5.8 percent buddy!

647
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,200
We should all do it.

648
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,040
You don't have to buy anything,
just go and chew their brains.

649
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,120
Go to a toy store and,
do you have aeroplane?

650
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,960
They're like, "Aeroplane toy..."

651
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,960
Oh in Japan toy aeroplane,
in India big aeroplane.

652
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,120
Fly...

653
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,280
People are buying
JCB to comb their hair.

654
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,040
When people see Indian
customers approaching, they hide,

655
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,560
"He will ask for expensive things now."

656
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,120
When you visit foreign countries...

657
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,480
There, if you don't know their language,

658
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,000
they don't know your language

659
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,600
then you don't try
to learn their language.

660
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,200
You just slow down your language,

661
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,840
hoping that it works.

662
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,480
In Japan I asked a man,
where is the station?

663
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,600
What is the way to the station?

664
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,280
He said, [Speaks Japanese]

665
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:25,840
I didn't understand anything.

666
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,600
He didn't understand anything.

667
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:33,320
So I repeated,
[exaggerates] where is station?

668
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,280
He also, [Speaks Japanese]

669
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,520
Where...

670
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,920
Like his brain understands English

671
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,360
Just that he has forgotten

672
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,400
If I speak slowly...

673
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,080
He is not a kid...

674
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,640
That if you speak slowly,
he will be like, "oh!"

675
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,480
He speaks a different language!

676
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,560
When you go,
and if somebody can't speak English...

677
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,360
You forget that you do speak English.

678
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,840
You start speaking bad English.

679
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,760
If he speaks bad English,
you will match it.

680
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,080
One man asked me,
"How many cigarette wanting you?"

681
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
I replied,
"Too many cigarette wanting me."

682
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,240
He doesn't understand English

683
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,040
nor do I speak understand English

684
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,320
communication done.

685
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,120
My parents are crying...

686
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,280
"Why did we educate him?

687
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,400
One he is smoking, to top that,

688
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,920
too many cigarette wanting me?!"

689
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,040
"Verb, tense, noun,
sentence he doesn't know anything."

690
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,400
My mom asked, [Gibberish]

691
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,320
People drive on the other side
of the road in foreign countries.

692
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,320
No one told them which side to drive on.

693
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,080
They are happy driving on the
wrong side, but it works for them.

694
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Because everyone is
driving on the wrong side.

695
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,520
They are also sitting on the wrong side,
in the car.

696
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,120
Inside the car.

697
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,680
And the Indian brain
is unable to fathom this.

698
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,920
One day before breakfast
I was standing around.

699
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,440
A car was approaching and on that
side a three year old kid was sitting.

700
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,960
I was so impressed that day...

701
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,040
No wonder this country
was progressing at a rapid pace.

702
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,560
Just check out this three
year old's driving sense.

703
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,160
Isn't this kid great!

704
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
Then on the same side,
a dog was seated in the next car.

705
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,880
I didn't get it then...

706
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,400
I said, now this is more like it.

707
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,720
In our country,
dogs are still chasing cars.

708
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,880
This dog, has placed his
paw on the accelerator and woohoo!

709
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,280
He's off, if this country is not
progressing, then which country will?

710
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,280
Foreigners think that
Indians are very good at maths.

711
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,000
Our mathematics, there's no bigger lie.

712
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,680
Aryabhatt is gone.

713
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,240
Who all here, don't like maths.

714
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,240
Give me a cheer.

715
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,360
Hey, don't lie.

716
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,320
Everyone's sitting, yes we like maths.

717
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,720
Now I'll ask a question
and everyone will be scared

718
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,920
2+2?

719
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,680
3...

720
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,760
I love maths...

721
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,200
I've noticed that there
are two kinds of people.

722
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,200
A.

723
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,640
People who hate math
and are not good at maths.

724
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:22,400
B.

725
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,200
People who like math,
and are good at maths.

726
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
From A and B I conclude

727
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,680
people don't hate maths,
they hate themselves.

728
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,360
There are things to hate about

729
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,640
how maths is taught in India.

730
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,840
Like a question was asked,
there's no maths at all...

731
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,240
If maths, then mom's, grandfather's,
brother's...sister's brother...

732
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,320
Your brother's,
sister's, mom's....sister's brother...

733
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,760
Then how are we related?

734
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,560
I used to simply write,
you and I are not related.

735
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,560
I don't want a relative.

736
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,840
Who comes as a question.

737
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,400
That too for one mark.

738
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,920
And when I solve it,
it turns out you are my mom?!

739
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,600
[Gibberish]

740
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,720
One question was asked,
which ideally should be banned...

741
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,000
One question was asked...

742
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,440
If two people can dig
up a road in 15 days...

743
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,720
Then how many days will it
take 15 people to dig up the road?

744
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,200
Who will fill it up?

745
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,800
You have dug up and made the
country into an underground tunnel.

746
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,480
And you want to dig more?

747
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,080
We used to be taught
all kinds of nonsense,

748
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,160
and we used to believe it as well.

749
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,080
We used to get a question.

750
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,840
The square root of minus one...

751
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,440
This was not a question,
but they used to teach us.

752
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,280
The square root of minus
one is an imaginary number.

753
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,440
We used to be taught, you guys remember?

754
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,720
The square root of minus
one is an imaginary number.

755
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,600
And we used to believe it.

756
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,320
It could be.

757
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,520
We haven't really thought about it.

758
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,720
That minus one itself
is an imaginary number.

759
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,840
It never occurred to us.

760
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,320
Have you ever seen a
naturally occurring minus one?

761
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Like,"Uncle,
how many apples in this apple tree?"

762
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,000
"Minus one"

763
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,160
"Give me a smoke as well."

764
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,600
How can there be a minus one?

765
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,320
Minus one...

766
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,040
How can Chintu have minus one sweets?

767
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,480
The only way you can
get minus one sweets is...

768
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,160
If you've never had sweets in your
life and one day you excrete a sweet.

769
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,280
Then you can come out
of the toilet and be like,

770
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,960
"I have minus one sweets."

771
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,640
[Gibberish]

772
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,600
"Sorry mummy one second"

773
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,280
[Gibberish]

774
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,320
I am displaying one sweet.

775
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,360
"Tell father to eat the sweet."

776
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,280
I really like the
audiences at a comedy show.

777
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,440
I love comedy audience.

778
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,840
Because you guys literally,

779
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,400
are beggars of happiness.

780
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,080
Really you guys are that.

781
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Think about it,
you give money, stuck in traffic...

782
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,440
A little outside here...

783
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,520
Standing in the line

784
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,400
You sweat a little...

785
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,120
You guys have come,
"We'll laugh a little."

786
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,880
You have to book the
tickets a month in advance...

787
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,720
"Dude, we have to laugh on that day."

788
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,040
"So many problems in life, brother's
also not able to make me laugh...

789
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,800
parents are unable to cheer me up."

790
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,000
"I need professional help."

791
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,560
"Will go for an hour
and forget the world...

792
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,760
Haha, lol, lol, rofl, lmao."

793
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,080
"Will have fun, dude."

794
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,880
You have come and are
sitting like school boys

795
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,400
for one hour like good kids.

796
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,200
This room fluctuates...

797
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,000
But you guys don't want to be happy,
you know that right?

798
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,800
You guys actually shouldn't feel happy.

799
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,040
If you had to be happy...

800
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,480
You would have all left after one joke.

801
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,880
You guys want to remain sad.

802
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,640
You guys are sitting, you hear
an awesome joke and you guys laugh.

803
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,640
When I told you the dust one
[Imitates laughter]

804
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,600
Then you are reminded of your life.

805
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,880
Then all of you from left to right,
look at me with sad eyes.

806
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,240
"Uncle, the effect of
the medicine is worn off."

807
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,560
"One more one more, let it come,
let it come, let it come, IT HAS COME!"

808
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,760
This room keeps fluctuating
between extreme depression and euphoria

809
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,160
See...

810
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,360
I stopped talking,
and you guys [Imitates sadness]

811
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,080
"Sigh, there's nothing
to look forward to."

812
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,720
Soon as a joke comes
[Imitates laughter]

813
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,880
How did you like this one?

814
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,560
It entered your brain right?

815
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,480
And now everyone will be like, "Hey,
get out now, you're lodged in there."

816
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,720
I really like the
audiences at a comedy show.

817
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,720
People come here in search of happiness.

818
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,840
They come in thousands.

819
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,640
I am paid for this,
so I have no problem.

820
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,200
I am also searching for happiness,
money is not something...

821
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,840
Money, five star
is not happiness, buddy.

822
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,600
Five star is the saddest
of the lot...because you are...

823
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,240
When you are in poor house,
you're like, this is why I'm sad.

824
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,680
When you go to five star,
and you're still sad...

825
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,680
you're like, I am just sad, it is me.

826
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,440
You won't find happiness like this guys

827
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,880
My friend suggested
a way to find happiness,

828
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,480
but I didn't find it even then.

829
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,840
My friend told me,
"You practice meditation."

830
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,320
"You practice meditation."

831
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,240
"You will attain happiness."

832
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,000
I tried to meditate...

833
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,400
I didn't find happiness,
but sadness became slow

834
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,440
So bad thoughts come to me slowly.

835
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,160
I am sitting, thinking,

836
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,960
should I die today,

837
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,520
or tomorrow?

838
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,160
Gandhiji has said, if you
have to die tomorrow, die today...

839
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,840
And if today, then now.

840
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,040
But I'll have to find a rope.

841
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,640
Not one good thought in my head.

842
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,440
The only way to attain true happiness,
is not through all of this

843
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,280
No..

844
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,960
The only way to attain true happiness...

845
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,320
The joy you feel when you
gossip about a third person...

846
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,440
Oh ho...oh ho...

847
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,000
It is an orgasm of the soul

848
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,720
Even if

849
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,600
Even if you are in the middle of sex...

850
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,640
And someone says, "Hey,
did you hear about Rahul?"

851
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Please wait one second.

852
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,480
Come on tell tell, what what
what what what, what what, tell tell...

853
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,440
Says, "Come on man let's
go get a drink and I'll tell you."

854
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,640
Everyone goes to listen to gossip.

855
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,920
The fun in bitching...

856
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,120
The joy you feel when you gossip
about a third person is incomparable.

857
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,000
That's why four people go out right?

858
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,800
Why do you think your mom says,
what will people say?

859
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,120
Because a group of
four will always criticize.

860
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,760
If you ever see four people on the road,
enjoying and laughing

861
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,440
From far off...

862
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,600
They are never saying that
my start up has picked up some funding

863
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,720
They are saying see
how his startup fell dude...

864
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,640
Four people are always enjoying...

865
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,120
Groups of two and three
cannot really enjoy.

866
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,000
In a group of two,
agreement, disagreement too quick.

867
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,840
You say, hey, Rahul is such an asshole.

868
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,320
He will say,
"That he is, tell me what you'll drink."

869
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,480
You will tell him,
"Dude, please add something else to this."

870
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,440
"What is your opinion of Rahul?"

871
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,680
"He is nothing, come on man..."

872
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,480
Disagreement is very quick,
Rahul is such an asshole.

873
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,320
"Dude, you're an asshole."

874
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,400
"Tell me what you'll drink."

875
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,360
Group of three is not a group...

876
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,760
In a group of three, either
someone is missing or someone is extra.

877
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,200
Sorry...

878
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,960
If there are groups of three here,
you know who you are.

879
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,040
Are you having sex?

880
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,360
No?!

881
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,120
Then you are extra.

882
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,040
Some people are nodding,
"Yes, yes, I felt that too."

883
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,080
In a group of four

884
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
there's one person who starts

885
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,840
Okay.
Starts bitching.

886
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,880
Some random stuff is happening

887
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,080
"Hey, did you watch the match?"

888
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,680
He says, "Hey, leave all that."

889
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,040
The other one says, "Left it."

890
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,920
"You said it and I left it."

891
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,520
"You tell."

892
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:40,880
So he says,

893
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,440
"You'll know the provocateur, right."

894
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,440
"He will provoke you."

895
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,800
"He will provoke a response from you."

896
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,920
"You guys know, right"

897
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,120
"Rahul got a promotion."

898
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,640
"How do you guys feel?"

899
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,280
"Tell me, how do you guys feel?"

900
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,120
You know it too.

901
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,720
One round of goodness should
precede one round of evil.

902
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,880
You'll too speak something good.

903
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,480
"Hey, feeling good.
I'm feeling good."

904
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,120
"Since good things have
happened to a hard working person,

905
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,320
I've gained trust on
myself...I mean on the world"

906
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,120
"Feeling good actually"

907
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,800
"What do you mean by feeling good?"

908
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,000
"He's our friend."

909
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,800
Every table has a student
from the state board

910
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,720
who can't pretend.

911
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,200
He can't.

912
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,920
He can't.

913
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,480
He has seen lot of miseries in life.

914
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,360
Teacher threw a duster on him,

915
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,600
he threw it back at the teacher.

916
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,080
He does not care.

917
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,720
He starts off.

918
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,520
He says, "Hey, Rahul..Ehhh.

919
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,080
"I feel like spitting on him."

920
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,280
Then he spits on the floor.

921
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,400
"I feel like spitting on him."

922
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,400
"Thooooo" [spits]

923
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Brother, you don't have to
show everything through gestures.

924
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,080
We know what is the meaning of spitting.

925
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,200
He's showing how to spit.

926
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,440
"Thooooo..Thooo Thooo Thooo" [spits]

927
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,000
Then one person starts off,

928
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,560
"Bro". Now the evil begins.

929
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:06,920
"First round."

930
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,080
But now you are vague.

931
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:09,880
You are like, "Yes, he's a bit weird."

932
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,560
"I get some vibes from him."

933
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,640
"Don't you get some vibes from him?"

934
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,480
"If he walks this way,
don't you feel like this?"

935
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,600
Non-tangible

936
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,440
First, non-tangible

937
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,480
"Little" [shows disgust]

938
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,840
"A little coffee..One day
when he was drinking coffee.."

939
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,560
"I wondered why does
he drink coffee this way."

940
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,920
Then one person presented
a tangible story.

941
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,120
He said, "What an
unprofessional guy Rahul is!"

942
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,720
"He smokes up so much."

943
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,920
"He has spoilt his brain."

944
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,680
"He thinks about
marijuana in everything."

945
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,640
"The other day,
boss asked him the supplier's number."

946
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,240
"So Rahul gave him the
contact of marijuana supplier."

947
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,160
"Guptaji is blasting
everyone on the phone,

948
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
"Hey, we haven't got the supply yet?"

949
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,240
"When will you send?"

950
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,080
He said, "Sir,
I'll send it whenever you ask for it."

951
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,600
"Just tell me how much you need."

952
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,560
"I told you 10 kgs."

953
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,520
"I'll get it right away.
Sir, just come below..Outside."

954
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,320
"You will deliver outside?"

955
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,280
"Yes Sir. I'll give it outside.
Please come."

956
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,840
A person walks into the
office with 10 kg marijuana.

957
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,320
Mr. Gupta got arrested.

958
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,160
"But where did the marijuana go?"

959
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,200
"I don't know, dude."

960
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,800
"Isn't it enough that
Mr. Gupta got arrested?"

961
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,760
The second person speaks up.

962
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,120
Now we have to start another story.

963
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,240
You're like, "This is nothing."

964
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,960
You've to start it like that.

965
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,600
"This is nothing, dude."

966
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,360
This is nothing.

967
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,640
Mr. Gupta got arrested, that's nothing.

968
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,040
This is nothing.

969
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,240
"This is nothing."

970
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,440
This is nothing.

971
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,960
"This is nothing.
We went to meet the chief minister

972
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,400
okay, to get permission for our event."

973
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,080
"We were sitting in
front of the chief minister,

974
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:41,560
talking to him."

975
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,920
He says, "We won't give permission."

976
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,120
"We won't give permission."

977
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,000
Rahul speaks up, "Sir, dude."

978
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,240
"Chief minister is a dude"

979
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,040
"Weed is now legal in California."

980
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,680
"When will it happen in Assam?"

981
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,400
The chief minister said,
"I'm Kerala's chief minister."

982
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,760
He says, "Sorry, dude, didn't mean it."

983
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:07,240
"He's your dude, your bro?"

984
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,000
The third person says,
"This is nothing."

985
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,160
"For an office outing,

986
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,760
we were passing though
the airport security."

987
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,880
"They took away Rahul's bag."

988
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,600
"Rahul argued with them."

989
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,120
He said, "Dude,
why did you take away my bag?"

990
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:22,640
So they say,

991
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,520
"Sir, there is some
bag in your marijuana"

992
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,960
Rahul says, "Sir, don't lie."

993
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,440
"I don't mix anything
with my marijuana."

994
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,600
"It's bad for the throat."

995
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,720
"And anyway,
it's not marijuana, it's hashish. Okay."

996
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,240
When the CRPF were taking him away,

997
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,120
he said, "Sir, why are you'll
wearing camouflage at an airport?"

998
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,000
"You'll are still visible"

999
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,480
"With normal clothes,
won't you be able to hide better?"

1000
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,600
CRPF said, "Idiot, you have brains."

1001
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,840
He said, "That's how sir,
you get it if you smoke up."

1002
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,480
They were asking INR 10,000 for bail.

1003
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,120
He asks them,
"Sir, do you accept PAYTM?"

1004
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,200
We are so scared of maths,

1005
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,640
we give away all our money to the bank.

1006
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:20,640
"You keep it."

1007
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,960
"Keep it, please."

1008
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,880
My favourite bank is Yes Bank.

1009
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,600
What were the names that were proposed,

1010
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,280
that this was selected?

1011
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,040
Yes Bank

1012
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:36,600
No Bank

1013
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,400
Or Maybe Bank

1014
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:40,920
"Select, Sir."

1015
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,280
"Is there a fourth option?"

1016
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,680
"Sir, All of the Above Bank"

1017
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:48,080
"Yes, 'Yes', it has a good vibe to it."

1018
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,560
"And with 'No' people won't realise
it's a bank."

1019
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,360
"If we write 'No Bank', people will say,

1020
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,640
"Oh okay, it's not a bank."

1021
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,760
"That's why I feel

1022
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,120
Yes Bank' is perfect."

1023
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,520
"Sir what about 'Maybe'?

1024
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,800
"See, even for 'Maybe'

1025
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,000
not sure, it maybe."

1026
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,040
Yes Bank

1027
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,920
There's a bank named 'Bank of India'.

1028
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,240
Are rest of the banks from England?

1029
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,160
Only you are from here.

1030
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,920
I'll name my child 'Child of India'

1031
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,320
Then what's the point
of naming ceremony?

1032
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,920
You can't have a name
as object of location.

1033
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:30,800
But my most favourite bank..

1034
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,840
I can't...I'll not take the name.

1035
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,880
But I'll tell you which bank it is.

1036
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
My dad works in a bank.
The day I met with an accident,

1037
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,440
I called up father,
"Dad, I met with an accident."

1038
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,480
Father says, "It's lunch time.
Call later."

1039
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,440
It's a lunch...Lunch break of India

1040
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,880
When you visit this bank,

1041
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,000
When you visit this bank,

1042
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,000
you face the previous generation.

1043
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,680
Because they are at their speed.

1044
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:00,600
You are at your speed.

1045
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,880
And none of you are going
to come into each other's speed.

1046
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,360
It's full clash.

1047
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
You go there the first day,

1048
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,680
explore the entire bank.

1049
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,440
In the evening,
you realise you had to take a token.

1050
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,320
You ruined an entire day.

1051
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,680
You did small talk
with the security guard.

1052
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,640
"Are there bullets in the
gun or it's just a fake one?"

1053
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,200
He says, "Should I fire?"

1054
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,920
"No, no, it's fine.
I was just asking."

1055
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,400
You enter the second day, get a token,

1056
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,800
but still your turn hasn't arrived.

1057
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,360
For a long time,
you read out the print on the windows.

1058
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,760
"Okay, single window.
Just like me."

1059
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,840
"Where to go? What to do?"

1060
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,040
Then you go to one counter.

1061
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,480
You stand in the line.

1062
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,360
"Madam, I want to deposit INR 500."

1063
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:50,840
But don't say like this.

1064
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,640
That's not how you talk in this bank.

1065
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,280
You say, "Hello madam"

1066
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,080
"I want to deposit INR 500."

1067
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,120
Your brain fails to comprehend

1068
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:09,400
that sound can travel from above.

1069
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,960
Sound can only travel
through the small hole.

1070
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,920
Like this.

1071
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,120
It will go in like this
and transaction will happen.

1072
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,280
Madam, doesn't care.

1073
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,880
Madam is typing with just one finger.
Okay.

1074
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,040
All employees of this
bank type with just one finger.

1075
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,760
The other hand is tied behind.

1076
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:26,920
"Don't use it."

1077
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,280
You are standing there smiling.

1078
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,720
Inverted smile.

1079
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,400
Madam goes on typing,
goes on typing, goes on typing

1080
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,080
You are just looking at her.

1081
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,000
You say, "Madam, still at username."

1082
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,880
"Password will require 'Shift' as well."

1083
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,720
"How will you do it?"

1084
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,040
Then you raise your voice,

1085
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,600
"Hey madam, I want to deposit INR 500."

1086
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,400
You've awakened the dragon.

1087
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,800
Madam will look at you and say,

1088
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,040
"Give the form."

1089
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,000
"A form needs to be filled?"

1090
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:04,800
"Sorry"

1091
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,160
"I'll come tomorrow."

1092
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:11,880
They have a form for everything.

1093
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,960
Everything.
There's a form to fill the form.

1094
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,720
"Hey brother, one form please."

1095
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,320
"Did you fill a form for that?"

1096
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,520
"Aaah. Sorry. Sorry"

1097
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:19,920
"Sorry. From where..
Where does it start from?"

1098
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,440
"You should start from childhood."

1099
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,760
"Brother, now, you'll are late."

1100
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,520
For anything

1101
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,880
If you go to loot a bank,

1102
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,920
with two big guns,

1103
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,960
and fire [Gunfire]

1104
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,360
"Give me all the money."

1105
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,680
"Please get the form filled."

1106
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,040
"Don't create a ruckus.
Don't fire a gun,

1107
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,960
That's very old."

1108
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,120
"I'm a terrorist.
Terrorist."

1109
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,320
"Write 'Terrorist' as your occupation."

1110
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:49,080
"To prove your occupation, do you have a

1111
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,000
certificate from any reputed
terrorist oragnisation?"

1112
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,840
"You'll need an attested
copy of the same."

1113
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:56,960
"Get that done."

1114
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,280
"And what else you need?"

1115
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,160
"I need all the money."

1116
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,760
"Write the denomination you prefer."

1117
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,200
"You'll get 2000 notes.
Is that fine?"

1118
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,000
"Uhhh ..Yes"

1119
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,800
"And don't create a ruckus,
he has diabetes. Okay."

1120
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:12,760
"Move aside."

1121
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,200
"Okay"

1122
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,360
Keeps the gun aside and fills the form.

1123
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,600
A bygone terrorist calls out, "Hey,
you think it's easy to loot?"

1124
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,640
"Since seven days, my rent agreement

1125
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,520
has not been accepted, dude."

1126
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:36,600
"Hey, it's not a private bank."

1127
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,320
"It's the government."

1128
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,240
You are given a form, you take it.

1129
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,760
You are screwed as it's just six pages.

1130
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,840
Then a great, knowledgeable man emerges

1131
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:49,800
and says, "No need to fill everything".

1132
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,920
And then he disappears.

1133
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:56,320
You get the form then realise that

1134
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,680
you don't have a pen.

1135
00:52:58,680 --> 00:52:59,880
But you don't give up.

1136
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,240
Never owned a pen in ten years.

1137
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,560
You start searching for a pen
in your own clothes.

1138
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,200
Pen...

1139
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,680
Must be here...must be here

1140
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,360
Umbrella....

1141
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,320
Sweet...

1142
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,120
Then you don't get a pen.
You find a pen.

1143
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,000
A pen is kept tied

1144
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:26,400
They feed it Parle-G.

1145
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,040
The pen's name is Chintu.

1146
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,400
If you call out, "Choo, choo"

1147
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:34,640
it [barks].

1148
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,200
This pen is tied ...

1149
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,480
which thief has such
low level of motivation?

1150
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,200
What's kept open is stolen.

1151
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,240
But if tied....Aaaaah

1152
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,800
Take the pen and start filling the form.

1153
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,240
Initially, it's all easy.

1154
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,640
Then you're faced with a doubt.

1155
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,680
Then there's an uncle next to you.

1156
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,720
Knowledgeable uncle

1157
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,840
The closer you stand near uncle,

1158
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,280
the better you will
be able to fill the form.

1159
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,040
First, you notice that, "Write
everything in capital letters...Oooo"

1160
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,840
Then you ask him a doubt.

1161
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,240
"Uncle, do I add name in the name field?

1162
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,560
Uncle says, "Do you have a name?"

1163
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,320
"Yes, I've a name."

1164
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,640
"Then write it."

1165
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:15,240
"Okay."

1166
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:17,240
"Father's name..."

1167
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,440
"Does your father have a name?
Then write it."

1168
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,680
There's an argument in the background.

1169
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,640
"Hey, today they are
asking for the gun license."

1170
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:25,640
[Exasperates] "Where
do I get the gun license?"

1171
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,960
"There was no registration
at the time I bought it."

1172
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,920
Terrorists argue, "What dude,
even today it's not happening."

1173
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:35,720
"My photo itself is not matching, dude."

1174
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,440
You continue filling the form.

1175
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,720
I don't understand why
people keep filling the form.

1176
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,360
The thing is, when you go the counter
after checking it ten times,

1177
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,280
it's the same failure.

1178
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,560
Very basic...You've checked it 40 times.
40 times.

1179
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,880
You've checked each thing ten times.

1180
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
Basic mistake

1181
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,160
You submit the form to madam,
madam says,

1182
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,600
"What's your name?"

1183
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,920
"Biswa"

1184
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,920
"So why is 'Vimal' written here?"

1185
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,280
"Oh sorry madam.
We were discussing and writing

1186
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,080
so it caused more problem."

1187
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,080
"What is the current year?"

1188
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,800
"2019"

1189
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,240
"It's written, madam."

1190
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,040
"You've written 2019 as your birthday."

1191
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,880
"Yes madam.
I'm so young."

1192
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,520
"See, I cannot reach."

1193
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,880
You continue writing.

1194
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:24,880
Keep trying.

1195
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,120
Everything..
For father's name there are 100 boxes.

1196
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,000
For mother's name there are 100 boxes.

1197
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:29,760
You write.

1198
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,240
Suddenly, in between,
you're faced with a tough question.

1199
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,400
"Who will get your
money after your death?"

1200
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,200
You say, "I'm depositing INR 500."

1201
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,240
"Cremate it along with me."

1202
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,800
Your mother speaks in the background.
[gibberish]

1203
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,280
"Sorry mother.
Shouldn't speak about death."

1204
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,040
I simply write,
"With this money, gift a typing course

1205
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,120
to Counter number 2 madam."

1206
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,920
That many people will be
saved from suffering slip disc.

1207
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,600
Then comes the most final field

1208
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:13,880
Toughest field

1209
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:14,960
Name has 100 boxes.

1210
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,880
Father's name has 100 boxes.

1211
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,840
Mother's name has 100 boxes.

1212
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,360
Address has three boxes.

1213
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,760
Fill it the way you can.

1214
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,520
And you don't give up.

1215
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,840
You rack your brains,
write the name on a rice grain.

1216
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,680
[Screams with joy]

1217
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,520
You start filling.

1218
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,560
Public will write address in full form,

1219
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,520
nothing shortened.

1220
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,960
"F-13, Godavari Building,
Take a left from main road,"

1221
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:36,960
"Don't be scared"

1222
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:39,080
"Keep going. Alright?"

1223
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,840
"Nothing to worry."

1224
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,880
"There...There's an unpaved road."

1225
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,240
"They've dug it up."

1226
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,120
"You might have to
come via one or two caves."

1227
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,440
"But stay courageous."

1228
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,960
"Keep going, you'll see a camel."

1229
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,680
"It's very depressed,
don't speak to it."
