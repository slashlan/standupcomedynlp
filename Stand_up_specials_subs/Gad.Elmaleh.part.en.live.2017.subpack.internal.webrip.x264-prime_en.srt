1
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,424
A NETFLIX COMEDY SPECIAL

2
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:17,851
GAD GONE WILD

3
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:24,650
- We’re ready.
- So we can go on now? We’re good?

4
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:45,462
Ladies and gentlemen, Gad Elmaleh!

5
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:11,655
Montreal!

6
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,162
Thank you!

7
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,291
I’m deeply moved.
It’s great to be here. This is home.

8
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,127
I’m very happy to be in Montreal.

9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,423
We have a history together after all.

10
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:33,218
I lived in Montreal for a few years. Yeah.

11
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,724
I loved my time in Montreal.

12
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,310
I got a Canadian passport.

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,854
Yeah, a Canadian passport. It’s great.

14
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,065
I also have a Moroccan passport,
my friends.

15
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,736
No, wait.

16
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,404
I don’t use it.

17
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:59,620
I’m proud of my Moroccan roots,

18
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,873
but obviously, now is not the time...

19
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,794
to go through American customs
and show them a large green passport

20
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,589
with large Arabic letters written
in a gold font...

21
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,884
and say, “I’m a comedian.”

22
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,941
The first time I entered the US,
the guy said, “What are you here for?”

23
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,357
And I said, “I’m a comedian.”
And he said...

24
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:38,450
“But why?”
“To prove that you do this for a living.”

25
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,786
Since then, every time they ask me...

26
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,080
I tell them...

27
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:59,388
The United States is very complicated.
I’ve been working there a lot lately.

28
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:02,015
Getting a visa is very complicated.

29
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,769
In the past, you could get a US visa
and do any job you wanted.

30
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,563
Now it’s become specific.
For example, I have a...

31
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,860
I am only allowed to do stand-up,
standing up, in front of you.

32
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,658
I can tell jokes, but I can’t dance or...

33
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,577
If I ever dance or sing,
a guy at Immigration will come say...

34
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,506
It’s getting more and more complicated.

35
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,592
But the Americans are cool.
They show an interest in you.

36
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,596
They always ask you where you’re from.
But they use a condescending tone.

37
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,097
When they ask...

38
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,224
it’s more like...

39
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,563
“Where are you from, little savage?”

40
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,445
“We’ll help you. We’re Americans.”

41
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:09,124
It depends. Whenever I say, “From France,”

42
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,919
I always get a very strange reply
from the Americans.

43
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,231
That’s a whole other country.

44
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,360
They have a different language
and a different organization.

45
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,157
So I won’t even mention Morocco.

46
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,661
The guy has no idea where Morocco is
on a map.

47
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,791
Sometimes they’ll say, “Oh, Monaco.”

48
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,461
And I’ll say, “No, that came later.”

49
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,341
But it’s interesting.

50
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,178
Everybody asks me why I went to the US
to do stand-up comedy in English.

51
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,182
In France, people say,
“Fuck, you don’t need to do that!”

52
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,893
Yes, I know. I love my French audience.

53
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,312
But in the US,
I give them an American-style answer:

54
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,527
They’re idiots.

55
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,364
So I performed
at comedy clubs every night.

56
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,783
It’s so different
from Europe or even Quebec.

57
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,494
At American comedy clubs,
people eat right in front of you.

58
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,497
I thought the biggest challenge
would be English.

59
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,373
No, it’s performing in front of someone

60
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,416
trying to laugh
while downing a cheeseburger.

61
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,461
Because Americans are obsessed with food!

62
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,756
I saw some crazy shit while on tour.
They have food contests!

63
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,511
In Europe, food contests are
who can make the best food.

64
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,846
There,
it’s who can wolf down the most food.

65
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,017
For what reason
should a guy eat 19 hot dogs?

66
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,396
“Why are you doing that?
You’re going to be sick. Stop!”

67
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,774
It’s interesting though.

68
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:04,322
To be honest, I think I wanted
to live the American dream.

69
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,950
I’ve been dreaming about it
since I was a kid.

70
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,995
I remember, growing up in Casablanca,

71
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,039
my dad would take me to the beach
and say something hilarious

72
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:16,626
while pointing at the Atlantic Ocean:
“If you take a boat”...

73
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,466
I was five years old.
I wasn’t going to take a boat.

74
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,177
“If you take a boat
and keep going straight...

75
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,723
you’ll land in America.”

76
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,434
I was fascinated
by the poetry of those words

77
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,853
and by the idea of traveling
to faraway America.

78
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,938
Somehow
he’d planted the American dream in me.

79
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,066
But I kept wondering if,
on the other side of the ocean,

80
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,610
there was an American dad...

81
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,700
talking to his son
about the Moroccan dream.

82
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,288
I don’t think so.

83
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,342
At the same time, we find America
fascinating. Let’s be honest.

84
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,178
But we’re sort of like,
“No, not too much.”

85
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,888
Come on, we love it!

86
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,974
Last week in New York,
I saw French people buying NYPD T-shirts.

87
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,939
French people don’t like the police
in France.

88
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,068
But as soon as they’re in New York:
“Bruno, ‘NYPD.’ Isn’t this cool?”

89
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:27,405
I don’t think Americans ever go to Paris

90
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,533
and ask where they can buy
National Police T-shirts.

91
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,536
I doubt that they do.

92
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:39,000
When Americans go to Paris, they want
the clichés they’ve seen in movies.

93
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,336
Like the narrow cobblestone streets...

94
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,882
with an old man playing the accordion
in the moonlight...

95
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,137
while a mime is doing stuff...
in the background.

96
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,472
A guy even told me...

97
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,311
With a little rat making croque monsieurs.

98
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,693
I’ve lived in Paris 30 years
and never seen streets like that.

99
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,530
And of course, they don’t speak French.
They don’t want to.

100
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:13,201
If you ask an English speaker in the US
or even in Canada, “Do you speak French?”

101
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,550
The English language is complicated.
I'm trying to learn it.

102
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,428
By the way, I don’t speak English.

103
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,681
I just learned how to do a whole show
in English.

104
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,477
The show is doing well, except at clubs.

105
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,063
Whenever I speak to the audience,
I have problems.

106
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,400
I can’t improvise. If a guy tells me
something at a club, I go...

107
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:53,033
One night, I decided to improvise a bit
like the American stand-up comics.

108
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,952
There was a couple in the front row,
so I asked...

109
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,245
He said...

110
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,177
English is so hard!
It’s really hard for French speakers.

111
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,180
When trying to learn another language,
there’s always someone who says,

112
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,808
“Gad, can I ask you a question?
It’ll take just a sec.

113
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:24,606
Do you...
Do you ever dream... in English?”

114
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:30,403
Yes, I dream in English. It’s a nightmare.

115
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,909
I dream in English and tell everybody to
speak more slowly. It’s very complicated.

116
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,412
English is complicated!
Vocabulary, grammar...

117
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:45,251
You have to put the emphasis on the right
syllable, but you never know which!

118
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,631
I don’t even know where to put
the emphasis on the word “emphasis”!

119
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,009
Is it “EM-phasis”
or “em-PHA-sis” or “empha-SIS”?

120
00:09:58,765 --> 00:09:59,849
I don’t know.

121
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,895
It’s complicated!

122
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,273
I wanted to buy a baseball cap for my son.

123
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,945
But I said something stupid
to the concierge at the hotel.

124
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,703
Yes, that means “coffin” in English.
He asked me...

125
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,497
I said...

126
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,292
He asked...

127
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,008
Whenever you ask an American to help you,
it gets even more confusing.

128
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,304
They always say...

129
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,850
Because they don’t know.

130
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,939
It’s so difficult, my friends.
It’s hard. It’s complex.

131
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,776
You have to learn the idioms.
And the accent.

132
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,864
We help them, but they don’t help us
if we don’t have it right.

133
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,240
They don’t give a shit.

134
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,618
Once, I got into a cab in New York
and told the guy...

135
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,042
“G” instead of “J.”

136
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,295
That’s not such a major mistake.

137
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,885
There’s still a bit of the “djj” sound.

138
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:23,558
But the guy had no idea what I was asking.
I said to him...

139
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:35,653
I mean, what kind of person
can’t figure this out? It’s crazy.

140
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,616
I didn’t say “XFK” or “QFK,” you know?

141
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,995
If I were a cab driver and you asked me
to take you to “KFC Airport...”

142
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,876
I’d take you to JFK.

143
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:54,088
And not because
I know there’s a KFC at JFK!

144
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:58,593
Because I can put two and two together
and figure out what you mean!

145
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:02,931
Imagine if some English speakers came up
to me in Paris, made a mistake and said...

146
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,684
I mean, I wouldn’t stop, but just imagine.

147
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,274
No, that’s a Parisian stereotype.

148
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,281
But imagine if they said to you...

149
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,659
And then made a mistake, like...

150
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,251
You wouldn’t tell him, “We don’t know
that tower.” You’d understand.

151
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,672
You wouldn’t tell him,
“I’ll take you to the Apple store.” No!

152
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,718
You’d figure out the guy wants
to go to the Eiffel Tower,

153
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,470
and you’d take him to the Eiffel Tower.

154
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:47,058
So the cab driver who heard me say “GFK”
kept correcting my accent,

155
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,060
and he was from India.

156
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,440
No problem. I just said to him,
“Man, we’re both immigrants.

157
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,443
How about we help each other out here?”

158
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,696
And then I said...

159
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,714
But I didn’t say anything.

160
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,843
I respect the Indian cab drivers
in New York.

161
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,014
I don’t know what kind of phone plan...

162
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,143
those guys have...

163
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:36,149
but there must be a specific plan
for monologues. I think it’s free.

164
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,652
They’re always on the phone

165
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,530
with another guy
who apparently never says anything.

166
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,243
You’re sitting in the back of the car,
and you hear...

167
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,250
Poor guy on the other end must be like...

168
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:05,303
And you don’t realize he’s on the phone.
You think he’s talking to you!

169
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,637
You say, “What?” and he goes...

170
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:12,060
And then he starts making fun of you
on the phone with his buddy!

171
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,104
You don’t know,
but you can just tell. He’s like...

172
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,783
I don’t care. I’m calling Uber.

173
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,293
But Uber is interesting, you see.

174
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:41,506
Whenever I call Uber,
I’m fascinated, as I watch the screen,

175
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,551
by the creativity of those guys
when they come to pick you up. It’s crazy.

176
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:50,098
They can do things with those little cars
that are impossible to do with real cars.

177
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:53,142
They can jump
from one street to another...

178
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:57,355
spin around and go on water.

179
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:02,860
And then they call you on your phone.
That’s the new thing.

180
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:05,446
“Hello, where are you?”

181
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,491
Where am I?
Is my uncle picking me up? What is this?

182
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,745
“I’m at home, waiting for you.”
“Okay, I’m on my way.”

183
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,623
“I know. That’s what the app is for, sir.”

184
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,377
I had a crazy experience with Uber once.

185
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,089
I was supposed to go out to dinner
with a woman, and...

186
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,593
What, you’ve never heard of such a thing?

187
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:32,682
Thank you. And... good evening.

188
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,812
So I called Uber and got in the car,
and the guy said to me,

189
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,732
“Sir, please let me open the door for you
when we arrive at your destination.”

190
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,985
I said, “No, that won’t be necessary.”

191
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,612
“No,
I want to provide you with good service.

192
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,574
That’s my job, and I love my job.”
“Okay, no problem.”

193
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,577
We picked up my date
and arrived at the restaurant.

194
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,912
He stopped, and I waited for him.

195
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,289
But he had forgotten.

196
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,506
So I was there in the backseat,
waiting like an idiot.

197
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,884
The girl said, “What’s going on?”

198
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,720
I’m there like Louis XIV, saying,
“He’ll open the door.”

199
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,475
But it all depends on where you are.

200
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,061
What I love about New York
is you can hail a cab off the street.

201
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,022
It’s complicated in Montreal.

202
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,191
It’s even crazier in Paris.

203
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,985
The cab is free. The guy sees you.

204
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,571
He doesn’t stop. It’s a concept.

205
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,992
It’s even more insane in Morocco.

206
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,496
The cab isn’t free,
but the guy stops anyway.

207
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,964
There are already eight guys in the car!

208
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,801
That’s where they came up with uberPOOL.

209
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,179
You just squeeze into the car...

210
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,938
There are vegetables or whatever.

211
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,565
And he’s the one who decides where you go.

212
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,069
There are so many stops, he has a menu.

213
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,614
“No, leave me alone.
My route is already all planned out.

214
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:16,160
I’ve got eight stops and you get off
at the one you think is the closest to”...

215
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,620
No!

216
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,957
And they know everything about your life.
This is Morocco.

217
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,001
They’re cab drivers,
so they know everything.

218
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:28,339
The other day, I gave the guy the address,
and he said, “Oh, your uncle’s place!”

219
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,593
How did he know?

220
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,598
I love to walk.
I enjoy going on walks. It’s cool.

221
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:40,685
I walked around a bit today.
I love to walk.

222
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:45,731
I also walk a lot in New York.
I enjoy asking Americans my way around.

223
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,024
They’re nice. They’re cool.

224
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:51,404
And they love to use Starbucks
as a reference point. They can’t help it.

225
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,323
In Europe, there’s the metric system.

226
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,994
In the US,
there’s the Starbucks unit of measurement.

227
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,705
Americans cannot give you directions

228
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,665
without mentioning Starbucks.
It’s impossible.

229
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:25,730
I also enjoy asking my way around
in Paris.

230
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,649
Parisians do something
you don’t see anywhere else.

231
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:33,487
When you tell them the street you’re
looking for, they sing it back to you.

232
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,198
“Excuse me, sir.
I’m looking for the rue de la Paix.”

233
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,535
<i>Rue de la Paix</i>

234
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,757
The guy was with his wife. “Madeleine,
do you know?” She did the same thing.

235
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,759
<i>Rue de la Paix</i>

236
00:18:56,886 --> 00:19:00,348
Then he said, “I don’t know it,
but I know another one. You want it?”

237
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,102
“No, sir.
I’m looking for the rue de la Paix.”

238
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,688
It’s so interesting
to see these differences.

239
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,775
And to watch people when you’re in the US.

240
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,196
Americans love to stand in line.
I don’t know why.

241
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,616
Wherever you go,
there are people standing in line.

242
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,536
I think they just see a line of people
and decide to stand in it.

243
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,833
Once I got in a line and asked a guy what
he was waiting for. He said, “My turn.”

244
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,087
So I said, “Why?” “I don’t know.

245
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,215
At some point, it’s going to be my turn,
and something’s going to happen.”

246
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,513
“But why?” “Because if I leave,
somebody is going to take my turn.”

247
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,973
They’re afraid of losing their turn,
you see.

248
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:46,769
And they’re all organized,
in straight lines! No problem.

249
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,813
In France, people wait in a...

250
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,566
And in Morocco...

251
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,613
people wait in circles.

252
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,075
Americans are nice, though,
especially when you arrive from Paris.

253
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,120
You go to a store in the US.
Sometimes, they try too hard.

254
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,622
You become suspicious.
“Why is he being so nice?”

255
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:09,375
In a store in New York,
a guy said to me...

256
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,305
I said to him...

257
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,523
But the guy was so eager!

258
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:36,485
I asked him for something,
and he started running in the store!

259
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,279
People would stop him, and he’d go...

260
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:46,912
“Calm down!” He went to the back
to look for it, came back and said...

261
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,957
I said, “That’s okay.”

262
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:54,545
“Jason, stop it, fuck! Calm down.”

263
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,300
“No, forget about it, Jason!

264
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,178
Don’t get tied up in knots over this!”

265
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,348
And then he said something
you’d never hear in France. He said...

266
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,605
In France, they don’t even “single-check”!

267
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:18,360
The guy will just say, “I don’t have it,
unless I start looking for it.”

268
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:27,912
There’s a store in the US
that French people are just crazy about.

269
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,997
It’s Abercrombie.

270
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,542
You know this store?

271
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,795
They’re not in Quebec yet.

272
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,714
I can tell by looking at you.
“We don’t have it.

273
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,591
We don’t have it.”

274
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,472
The smell, the darkness.

275
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:51,519
You know, some of the young men
who work at Abercrombie are shirtless.

276
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,689
They’re just... their chest is naked.

277
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:59,735
I was looking at some shirts,
and a guy came over and said,

278
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,739
“Yeah, those shirts are great.
They’re my favorite.”

279
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,495
“Then why aren’t you wearing one?”

280
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:15,042
And those scented candles!
It’s all about candles today.

281
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:18,045
Candles are everywhere.
It’s sophisticated. It’s fancy.

282
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,756
People buy candles
because they smell nice.

283
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,217
“Did you light some candles?”
“Light a candle.”

284
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,928
“There were candles everywhere
in that store. It was great!”

285
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,930
“What did he get for you?” “A candle.”

286
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,474
“Really?” “Yeah, a big candle.”

287
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,726
“We went to dinner and they lit a candle.”

288
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,437
“And before going to bed,
we blew out the candle.”

289
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,648
It’s all about candles. It’s great.

290
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,193
Candles are everywhere, and they come
in increasingly sophisticated scents.

291
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,196
I was in a store in Paris the other day,

292
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:50,327
and I saw a candle with a scent called
“Monday Morning in Alaska.”

293
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,958
But I’ve never been there.

294
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,671
So I took a whiff and said,
“Alaska, maybe, but Monday?

295
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,883
It smells like Tuesday, madam.”

296
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,637
It’s a hipster thing, right?

297
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,681
Hipster. It’s a boho thing.

298
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:15,352
What’s up with all these new stores
popping up all over the world

299
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,772
and selling two shirts, a candle,
a bike and a leg of lamb?

300
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,441
What’s up with that?

301
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,945
“Hello. Do you have any scooters?”
“No, but I have cake.”

302
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,572
It’s just weird.

303
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,992
And it’s becoming very sophisticated.

304
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,661
But it’s cool. It’s different.

305
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,105
Everything is different in the US.

306
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,375
In Quebec and France, it’s in the streets
that people ask for things.

307
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:42,171
People with clipboards and little signs
asking for stuff.

308
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:46,717
Associations and organizations wanting
your money and asking you to sign things.

309
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,303
What’s interesting is
that all these people asking for things

310
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,681
have one thing in common:
their body language.

311
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,933
I tried making sense of it.

312
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:58,604
Their body wants to go towards you,
but their mind tells them they shouldn’t.

313
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,106
They always show
some very interesting body language.

314
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,653
Like, “Excuse me, we’re an association,
and we’d like two minutes of your time

315
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:11,617
because what we’re doing for the whales
is our way of giving back something”...

316
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,081
Or they’ll come towards you
while you’re going in their direction,

317
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,166
and as soon as you meet, bam!

318
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,294
They start walking backwards with you.
“Actually, what we’re trying to do”...

319
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,883
Do these people get any training?
How does it work?

320
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:35,057
I’ve just started a new life in New York
with this show I’m performing in English.

321
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:39,019
New York is insane. It’s truly
an insane city. Everything moves so fast.

322
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:44,108
But it’s cool.
I’ve made a lot of new friends.

323
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:47,778
I’ve done some sightseeing.
I went to see the Statue of Liberty.

324
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:53,534
I was very curious to see the gift
France had made to the United States.

325
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,538
Why a statue? When did the French decide
to give their American friends a statue?

326
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,707
Maybe they met a long time ago

327
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:04,128
and it was like when your kids are invited
to a rich kid’s birthday party:

328
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,256
You don’t know what to give them.
You think, “Fuck, they have everything.”

329
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,008
They must have said,
“What can we give the Americans?”

330
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,428
“I don’t know...

331
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,936
How about free health care?”
“No, they won’t like that.”

332
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,945
Yeah. “I don’t know.” Thank you.

333
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,906
That was a pretty strange
clapping pattern.

334
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,661
It was like a wave that started out
at the back and moved towards the center.

335
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:40,706
Then on the balcony they were like,
“Are you going to clap?”

336
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,877
“Oh, I don’t know. I don’t feel like it.
It’s a good show,

337
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,171
but I want to follow my own rhythm.”

338
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,550
“My <i>ryth’</i>!”

339
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,346
In Quebec, it’s very important to not
pronounce the word endings, my friends.

340
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,767
It’s <i>socialiss</i> and <i>professionnaliss</i>.

341
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,978
I’ve always wondered what the Quebecois do

342
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,647
with all those word endings
they don’t use.

343
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,525
I figured they probably recycle them.

344
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,361
And they do! For the French word <i>ici</i>,

345
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:14,114
they take two T’s from another word
and say <i>icitte</i>.

346
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,710
So they were at the meeting
and somebody said,

347
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,879
“I think a statue would be great.

348
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:34,218
We’ll make this huge,
somewhat androgynous, crowned figure...

349
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,596
holding something like an iPad
and a torch.

350
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,475
I think they’re going to be hooked.
They’re going to love it.

351
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:47,564
And we’ll give it a chic Parisian twist.
It should look pretty good.”

352
00:26:47,648 --> 00:26:50,484
And then the French shipped it
to the Americans.

353
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,365
And the Americans got an e-mail
from Amazon saying,

354
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,368
“People who enjoyed this
also enjoyed the Eiffel Tower.

355
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,119
Does that interest you?”

356
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:05,499
I found an apartment in New York,
which is very difficult.

357
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,126
Even more so if you’re not an American.

358
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:11,129
I had a real estate agent
who showed me all sorts of places.

359
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:15,926
One day, I said, “I like this one,
but I need to think about it.” She said...

360
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:22,724
She said...

361
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,312
In New York, there’s always
another guy who’s interested.

362
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,273
And in Paris, too. Everywhere.
In Montreal.

363
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,859
There’s always a guy.
I don’t know who he is.

364
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,863
One day I’d like to sit down
with this guy and ask,

365
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:39,449
“How do you end up taking
all those apartments? You’re crazy!”

366
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:44,162
Then she said to me,
“We require six months’ rent in advance.”

367
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:47,165
You become stupid
when you want something. “Okay!”

368
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,212
Then she said, “We also require
nine letters of recommendation.”

369
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,508
I didn’t even know nine people there!

370
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,720
I asked her,
“Could you be one of those people?

371
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,725
You, the Uber driver...”

372
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,981
And then I remembered that one
of my mom’s cousins lived in Brooklyn.

373
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,067
An old Moroccan guy.
I asked her if I should call him.

374
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:18,572
And she said,
“No! Please don’t! Oh, dear, not him!”

375
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:22,367
I asked her, “What is it, Mom?”
“He’s old, and he has schizophrenia.”

376
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:25,662
So I said,
“Great! That’s even more people.”

377
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:40,052
I met with one of my friends
at his place this afternoon.

378
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,679
He’s been renovating lately.

379
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:45,641
You know these people who want
to explain the way it was before?

380
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,437
But you don’t care.
You just want to enjoy your coffee.

381
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,274
“No, let me tell you,
it wasn’t like this at all before.”

382
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,611
“I don’t care. I’ve never seen it before.
It looks good now.”

383
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,114
“No, but you need to know...

384
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,910
It’s unbelievable,
unbelievable what we did here.

385
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,288
The kitchen was on the other side.

386
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:13,001
And where you’re sitting now...
you’re going to love this...

387
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:17,297
in that spot, there used to be a wall.
Crazy, right?”

388
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,881
“No.

389
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,969
That’s not what ‘crazy’ means.”

390
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,597
And then his wife showed up.

391
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,975
“Have you met Jessica?” I said, “Yeah.”

392
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:30,102
He said, “She wasn’t like this before.”

393
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,358
I said, “Yeah, I can see
she’s had some work done.”

394
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:42,614
You can’t relate
to experiences you’ve never had.

395
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,242
I don’t know if it’s a good comparison,

396
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:49,329
but you know when someone tells you
someone you didn’t know died?

397
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:55,127
You kind of feel ambivalent about it.

398
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:59,298
You say you’re sorry,
but you actually don’t give a shit.

399
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:06,680
Especially when they add
the person was 98 and died in their sleep.

400
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,766
You just want to say,
“Shut up. Leave me alone.”

401
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,525
It’s great to hear
the French language spoken again.

402
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,696
Sometimes I miss it when I’m in the US.

403
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,033
I made a little CD
to listen to in the car.

404
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,786
Whenever I press play, a guy yells,
“Move, you idiot!” in French.

405
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,671
And it calms me down.

406
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,800
It makes me feel good.

407
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,261
There are things I don’t understand
about the United States.

408
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,264
My friends,
there’s one sport I don’t get at all.

409
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:53,352
I try. Mediterraneans, French, Europeans.

410
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,189
We all try to get baseball.

411
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,566
Canadians sort of get it.
You even have a team.

412
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,194
But you’re pretending.
I’m sorry, but you don’t actually get it.

413
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,488
I don’t understand
what these guys are doing.

414
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:09,076
I try, but it’s so boring.
The guys don’t do anything.

415
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,954
They hit the ball, then they stop,
then they start walking like this.

416
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,456
“What are you doing, guys?”

417
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,793
One of my buddies told me,
“But you have to see it live!”

418
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,921
He took me
to the Mets’ stadium in New York.

419
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,882
And it’s the same thing: boring, but live.

420
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:29,805
We were watching the game,
and at one point he said to me,

421
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,723
“Let’s go get hot dogs and pizza.”

422
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,975
We were gone for 25 minutes.

423
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:39,022
When we came back, the guy who was
there before was still standing like this.

424
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,569
I said,
“Jerry, did they pause the game or what?”

425
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:52,953
Do you know what can happen when
you leave a soccer game for 25 minutes?

426
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,289
Maybe they’ve sold two players!

427
00:31:57,958 --> 00:32:01,711
Or one of them’s died!
Maybe the crowd invaded the field.

428
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:03,964
Maybe four goals have been scored.

429
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:08,677
The only thing that’s a bit cute
is the kiss cams.

430
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,267
Americans are a bit shy, but they’re cute.

431
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,227
Whenever the camera lands on a couple,

432
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,689
they look at each other:
“Hey, it’s us! We have to kiss.”

433
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:24,151
They kiss,
and the Americans start screaming.

434
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,154
Can you imagine
if they had those in France?

435
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,615
Who knows what the couple would do?

436
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,452
“Honey, it’s on us. We have to do it.”

437
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,667
We were gone for 25 minutes.

438
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,836
I remember when I’d watch soccer
with my dad,

439
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,297
and he’d ask me to get him a beer.

440
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,924
I’d walk over to the kitchen like a crab.

441
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,012
I didn’t want to miss a single thing!

442
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,432
But I try to participate
in American culture.

443
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,642
My American friends took me
to a steak house.

444
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,395
It’s a very basic concept: steak house.

445
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,776
Apparently, they don’t do this
for other types of food.

446
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,279
There are no chicken apartments.

447
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,506
I saw something typically American
over there:

448
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:33,929
a guy down on one knee
and holding a small box up to a woman,

449
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,974
who was hopefully his fiancée
or girlfriend.

450
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:41,478
He was asking her to marry him.

451
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,980
No, I’m sorry.

452
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:49,319
Everyone in the restaurant
had the same emotional reaction.

453
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,655
I had an emotional reaction, too.

454
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,741
It’s called embarrassment.

455
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,954
I felt like saying, “You don’t do
this kind of thing in public.

456
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,915
Especially not in a steak house!
What are you doing?

457
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,501
Why do you think she’s crying?”

458
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,339
I asked the Americans,

459
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,008
“Do you get divorced in public, too?
How does that work?”

460
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:16,263
Wouldn’t that be funny? The waiter would
bring a cake with the divorce papers.

461
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:20,100
“Okay!” And then everybody would
start crying. The guy would say...

462
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:30,527
I enjoy seeing all the couples here
thinking, “No, that’s not how it works.

463
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,238
It’s not like that at all.”

464
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,659
It was an incredible tour. I went
to several cities, including Los Angeles.

465
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:45,166
The Quebecois rename every city!

466
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:49,212
And they pronounce them however they want.

467
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:53,258
They’ll say “Bos-TON,”
but not “Washing-TON.”

468
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:57,721
Who decided this?

469
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,687
Los Angeles is an interesting city.

470
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,939
It’s an intimidating city for a guy.

471
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,650
All the guys there work out.
They’re big and muscular.

472
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,864
I don’t “work out.”

473
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:19,242
Our body type doesn’t exist there.

474
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:23,705
I can see we all have the same body.

475
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,087
You don’t see that kind over there.

476
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:35,050
If you see a guy with this kind of body,
he’s not from there.

477
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:39,220
That doesn’t mean he’s French though.
Unless he’s wearing a scarf.

478
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,935
I don’t know why the French are so
into scarves. They always wear one.

479
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:50,148
“But it’s warm out, Mathieu!”
“I don’t care.”

480
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,820
But it’s cool
to see those guys who work out.

481
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:59,532
They want to look handsome, elegant,
strong, muscular on the beach.

482
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,453
I want to look good with my clothes on,
not without my clothes.

483
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,248
Because once you’re naked with a girl,

484
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:11,419
you’ve already scored,
you know what I mean?

485
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,261
I find it a bit intimidating.

486
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,892
What I fear most is snoring
the first night I sleep over at a girl’s.

487
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,813
So what I do, when I’m spending
the first night with a woman,

488
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:34,067
is sit in front of the TV, wait for her
to fall asleep and try to resist.

489
00:36:37,404 --> 00:36:39,614
The problem is that,
when you’re a big snorer,

490
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,325
you give sneak previews
of what’s going to happen.

491
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:51,710
All the snorers here are like,
“Yeah, it’s true.

492
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,421
I’m also part of the club, yeah.”

493
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:57,257
But you’re in front of the TV
and you go...

494
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,474
And you look at her,
like, “What’s going on?”

495
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,689
One time I even asked,
“Did I just hear a puppy?”

496
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,820
And I snore big-time, my friends.

497
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:24,951
I don’t know if anyone snores elegantly,
but I snore like a farmer’s boy.

498
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,997
I don’t know how to explain this.

499
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,544
It’s like I’m dying every time.
Have you heard that type of snoring?

500
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,763
Every time, it feels like I’m dying.
Every time.

501
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:48,725
Every four minutes, I die,
I come back, and then I die again.

502
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:53,938
People have told me, “I thought I’d have
to give you mouth-to-mouth or something!”

503
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:57,275
One of my buddies asked me,
“Why don’t you wear a mask?”

504
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,903
“That’s worse!
What if she sees me wearing the mask?”

505
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,405
“Just wait till she falls asleep
before putting it on.”

506
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,867
“What if she gets up to pee
in the middle of the night

507
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,661
and sees me, a fighter pilot?”

508
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,749
“Hey, I have a surprise for you!
We’re going to play pilot!

509
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:18,505
The Pilot and the Princess.
Are you ready, honey?”

510
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,267
I don’t even know why I’m talking
about this. It was Los Angeles, then...

511
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,104
This always happens when I’m in Montreal.

512
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:37,607
The audience always takes me
somewhere else.

513
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,576
They decide. It’s crazy, huh?

514
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,373
I remember one time,
I was performing in Morocco.

515
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,834
A lady wanted to take a picture of me,

516
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,253
and because of the glare of the spotlight,
she did this.

517
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:12,392
Every audience is different,
surprising and fascinating.

518
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,102
In the US, for instance,

519
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:18,356
what we call a <i>rappel</i> in French
is called an “encore” over there.

520
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,984
They borrow a French word,
add an English accent

521
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,777
and explain to you what it means.

522
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,663
Well, they don’t do that over there.

523
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:37,876
Comedians and singers always end
their performance with,

524
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,670
“Thank you, good night!”
and then they go backstage.

525
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:44,048
Again, what is the idea behind an encore?

526
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:49,053
It’s when an artist finishes a show
and then hides backstage.

527
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:54,642
He pretends,

528
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,187
he makes the audience believe
that he’s gone home because he’s tired.

529
00:40:01,608 --> 00:40:03,943
The audience pretends they want him
to come back onstage.

530
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,486
Everybody pretends.

531
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,743
It’s a contractual agreement
between you guys and us, you see?

532
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,746
The artist is backstage and
the audience screams, “Encore, encore!”

533
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,624
And the artist thinks,
“This is so moving! What to do?

534
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,668
Should I go home or get back onstage?”

535
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:24,088
So he goes back onstage
and the audience says, “Yeah!”

536
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,966
And he says,
“Oh, wow! I wasn’t expecting this!”

537
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,638
But I didn’t know it was different
in the US.

538
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:35,016
After my first show in New York,
I went to hide backstage.

539
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,357
When I came back, everybody was gone.

540
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,328
So I went home.

541
00:40:57,413 --> 00:41:00,166
So... Los Angeles, right?

542
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,878
Very interesting.

543
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,297
But I find Los Angeles intimidating.

544
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,217
My buddies wanted to take me
to this restaurant. “It’s the best.”

545
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,927
Everything is “the best” over there.

546
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,181
They love fusion.

547
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,141
Since they don’t have their own cuisine,

548
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:20,061
they pick and choose from others
and say, “This is ours.”

549
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,107
One guy said to me...

550
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:38,454
I told him, “I hope it’s the best.
It should be the only one you have.”

551
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,295
He took me there,
and the waiter came over.

552
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,217
A good-looking 18-year-old guy. He said...

553
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,553
As if he were doing a show.

554
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,682
I said, “What kind of red wine
do you have by the glass?” He said...

555
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,150
Who goes to a restaurant
to eat somebody else’s favorite food?

556
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,986
Except if you’re married
and your wife says,

557
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,031
“You take the fish,
I’ll take the chicken, and we’ll share.”

558
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,909
And all you can do is mumble.

559
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,750
“Is it good?”
“Of course, since you told me to eat it.”

560
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,170
During the drive back home,
“Was your chicken good?”

561
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:30,339
“Yeah, it tasted a bit like fish,
but it was okay.”

562
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,845
Guys can be such idiots.

563
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,225
Anyway, I told the waiter...

564
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,034
I love texting.

565
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:02,121
I’m a bit shy. Seriously.

566
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,000
I’m okay onstage,
but in real life, I like texting.

567
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,835
You can hide, say whatever you want.

568
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,047
I don’t know
if it’s because I’m getting old,

569
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,425
but the one thing I don’t get
is the new emojis.

570
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:19,806
I texted a girl: “Want to go out
for a drink tomorrow night?”

571
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:25,311
She wrote: “No problem.
Spanish dancer, Spanish dancer,

572
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,397
two fireworks,
four glasses of champagne...

573
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,609
a monkey covering his face...

574
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:36,572
a pair of red heels,
some nail polish, two buildings,

575
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:38,866
a taxi and an eggplant.”

576
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,708
I didn’t know what to do.
I called her an ambulance.

577
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,802
One thing
that’s unique to North America is dating.

578
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,637
You know, dating.

579
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,182
Every type of relationship
has a name and a structure.

580
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:08,062
What I like about Europe
is the seduction, the game.

581
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,858
You don’t know.
The unknown, the spontaneity.

582
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,985
Thank you.

583
00:44:14,861 --> 00:44:17,572
That’s great. What’s your name?

584
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,450
I have to admit,
I’m feeling a bit horny right now.

585
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,744
What’s your name?

586
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:27,331
Excuse me? Johanne. Oh, “Jowanne”!

587
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,587
She corrected me!
I said “Johanne” and I had it right,

588
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,756
but since she’s from Quebec... “Jowanne.”

589
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,552
Nice to meet you. Is that your guy?

590
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:44,223
It’s going be a hot night.
What do you do for a living?

591
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,226
You work at customs?

592
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,947
Johanne, can I ask you something?

593
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:02,617
Has anyone ever checked “yes”

594
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,245
on every question about farms
and animals and all that?

595
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,920
Seriously, has a guy ever said,
“Yes, I went to a farm,

596
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,297
I have meat and cheese...

597
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,928
and I’ve never been vaccinated.

598
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,180
I love your country!”

599
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,099
Does anyone bring stuff in and declare it?

600
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,897
Ah, not everybody declares it.
That’s where the dogs come in.

601
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,900
Because cats don’t care.

602
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,153
If a cat smells sausage,
it’ll just sneeze.

603
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,032
Do you work at the airport?

604
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,411
Wow, so you work in an office.

605
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,997
You take care of the serious stuff,
when they bring guys in.

606
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,876
You’re the one that solves problems.
Wow, Johanne.

607
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:56,045
It’s funny because I have mixed feelings.

608
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,255
I find that both scary and exciting.

609
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,388
I can see you in uniform,

610
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,808
yelling at me
because I brought back a tagine, you see?

611
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,689
What’s the most mind-blowing thing
you’ve seen?

612
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,358
“Wow, I can’t believe he put this
in his suitcase”?

613
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,903
Sandwiches.

614
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:28,703
Imagine Johanne in a meeting at customs
with all those RCMP guys.

615
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,831
“We’ve got a problem.
There’s a sandwich in the suitcase.”

616
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:45,678
“Sir, do you realize you entered Quebec
with a sandwich?

617
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,809
With ham and cheese in it?

618
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,896
That’s not very kosher.”

619
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:04,697
That’s great, Johanne.

620
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,242
And your boyfriend, what does he do?

621
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,162
He’s a heavy metal drummer.

622
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:16,792
You know, my dear, this show will air
in France, so I’ll translate.

623
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,970
He’s a hard rock drummer.

624
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:33,184
That’s great! Heavy metal, really?

625
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:36,520
You don’t have a lot of hair
for a heavy metal guy.

626
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:41,692
Oh, you take care of that.
This is an incredible couple!

627
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,404
Does she go through your stuff
before you leave on tour?

628
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:51,619
“Honey, do whatever you want,
get all the girls you want.

629
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,163
Just don’t put any sandwiches
in your suitcase.”

630
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,124
Please give Johanne a round of applause!

631
00:48:02,755 --> 00:48:06,634
The first time I performed
in English in New York,

632
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,845
my mother wanted to come and see the show.

633
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:13,015
She took a plane to come and see it.

634
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,434
My mom doesn’t speak English.

635
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,229
But she commented on my show.

636
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,858
That’s my mom for you.
I said, “Mom, you don’t know English.”

637
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:25,528
She said, “Maybe not, but I know my son.”

638
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,615
That opening night was difficult.

639
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,327
I was performing in English in front
of an audience that I didn’t know,

640
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,954
and there were people eating burgers.

641
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:40,459
After I got offstage,
I said, “Mom, I didn’t like the show.”

642
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:45,381
She said, “No, honey,
that was your perception from the stage.

643
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,801
I was sitting in the audience.
It was worse.”

644
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,563
My mom is the funniest woman in the world,
and she doesn’t even realize it.

645
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:06,068
Once my sister came over
when she was sick. My mom called.

646
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:09,405
My sister picked up and said, “Hello?”
My mom said, “What’s going on?”

647
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,658
She said, “I’m sick.”
My mom said, “Quick, go to the kitchen.

648
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:16,537
Fill a cup with hot water,
add lemon, cinnamon and salt,

649
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,748
and give it to your brother
before he catches the same shit!”

650
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,923
My dad is also quite the character.

651
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,593
He’s very interesting.

652
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,387
And unknowingly funny, too.
There’s no communication.

653
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,308
He’s a typical Moroccan dad.
No talking ever.

654
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,810
Just hand gestures and facial expressions.

655
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,358
Anyone know this threatening gesture?

656
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,695
When I tried it in the US,
they became upset.

657
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,948
There are two schools.
There’s: “You shouldn’t do that.

658
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:56,410
Daddy needs to talk to you
and explain exactly what’s going on.”

659
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:57,828
And then there’s this.

660
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:01,624
It means, “I’m going to shove
this shoe down your throat, son.”

661
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,463
Typical Moroccan dad.
No patience with his kids. Ever.

662
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,049
Whenever we played hide-and-seek,
he didn’t look for us.

663
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:17,640
I swear. He’d say, “Go and hide”
and then leave for work.

664
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,729
We’d spend entire days and nights hiding
in closets.

665
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:27,358
The worst part was we’d hear my mom say,
“Go look for them!”

666
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:30,444
And he’d say, “I don’t like this game!
Give me a break!”

667
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,574
I had a house built in Marrakech.

668
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,953
It’s still under construction, since 1987.

669
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:45,918
My electrician installed a system
that no one else in the world has.

670
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:52,675
I’m the only guy in the world
who turns on his microwave...

671
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,136
and the garage door opens.

672
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,683
I told my electrician,
“Hamid, how did you do that?”

673
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:04,853
He said, “I do the same as you.
I improvise and see what happens.”

674
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,611
That house in Marrakech
has given me headaches

675
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,155
caused by things that can only happen
in Morocco.

676
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,618
I was working in the US
and getting these surreal phone calls,

677
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:22,663
like, “Mr. Gad,
the swimming pool exploded.”

678
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,545
For me, the real problem
wasn’t technical or mechanical.

679
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,338
That could be fixed.

680
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:35,592
But where did this guy get the idea
that a pool can explode?

681
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:40,139
I asked him, “But wasn’t Hamid around?”

682
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,975
He said, “Yes, but he was in the pool.”

683
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:47,104
Imagine the crazy image that I got.

684
00:51:51,692 --> 00:51:53,444
I have to go there in a few days.

685
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,281
And I hate traveling
because I hate airports.

686
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:59,467
At the airport,
either you have five minutes

687
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,869
to catch a flight, so you run,

688
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,455
or you have a five-hour wait
and want to kill yourself.

689
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,875
“What am I going to do?”
It makes you insane!

690
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:12,546
What gets on my nerves in airports
is watching people with travel pillows.

691
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:18,218
I don’t know why.
As soon as I see one, I just hate it.

692
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:22,431
And these guys walk around
like they weren’t wearing a travel pillow.

693
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:31,815
Do they put that pillow on right after
getting dressed in the morning?

694
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:35,736
The travel pillow is the only thing
you put on before using it.

695
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,114
You don’t do it with a toothbrush.
“Okay, I’ll do this later.”

696
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,826
You don’t do it with a condom.
“Hey, you never know.”

697
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,456
And I don’t want to go through security.

698
00:52:48,499 --> 00:52:49,833
Johanne.

699
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,713
I don’t want
to do the pose they make you do

700
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:56,840
in the X-ray machine.

701
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,467
You know this pose?

702
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:04,723
They make you do that in the US.
In the X-ray machine.

703
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:11,313
They do this to make sure you don’t have
anything on you that could kill people.

704
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:15,025
But by using this machine,
they’re killing you.

705
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,614
In 15 or 20 years, we’ll be shaking
like this when we go in the machine.

706
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:22,950
“What happened to you?”
“I traveled too much

707
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,161
and took in too many rays
from the X-ray machines.”

708
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:31,125
After you’ve gone through
the X-ray machine, they still search you.

709
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:35,254
Since I’m annoyed, I say,
“Okay, search me.

710
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,005
But you’ve got to catch me first.”

711
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:41,218
As soon as he starts, I say...

712
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,389
One guy asked,
“Is there something in your pocket?”

713
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,266
I said, “Why don’t you find out?”

714
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,896
The last time I traveled,
I was in first class.

715
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,861
That’s North America for you. In France,
they would have yelled, “Asshole!”

716
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,493
So I was sitting in first class
and dressed casually.

717
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,538
A baseball cap... even if I don’t get it...
jeans, running shoes.

718
00:54:10,122 --> 00:54:12,499
And this guy was looking at me
like he was judging me.

719
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:18,422
“This man is definitely not traveling
in the appropriate class.”

720
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:21,759
I don’t know why, maybe I’m paranoid,

721
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,344
but I wanted to defend my right
to be there,

722
00:54:24,428 --> 00:54:27,514
and the best I could come up with was
to mess with him

723
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,392
so that he’d remember me
for the rest of his life.

724
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:34,021
I started acting like a raging madman
who had never seen this before.

725
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:49,077
I pointed to my seat, the one I paid for
and that was on my boarding pass,

726
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:51,830
and asked him,
“Do you think I can take this seat?”

727
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:54,350
He said, “Certainly not,
unless you’re traveling first class.”

728
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:58,003
I said, “Shh, don’t tell anyone.
Who cares if I sit here?”

729
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,672
I sat down and started playing
with the buttons.

730
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,971
I said,
“This is much better than in the back!”

731
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,311
So the guy called the flight attendant.

732
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:17,064
He said, “I don’t believe
this man is traveling first class.

733
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,900
You will need to...”

734
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,655
And I’m behind the flight attendant,
going like this.

735
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:31,036
She says, “I’m sorry, but I have to ask
to see your boarding pass again.”

736
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,165
I said, “No problem. Let’s go over there.
I don’t want him to see it.”

737
00:55:36,792 --> 00:55:40,921
I gave it to her and she said,
“I’m so sorry, Mr. Al... El”...

738
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,174
“Yes, it’s okay. You’re good.”

739
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:48,220
She said,
“I’m sorry. You can take your seat.”

740
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,014
And she said to him,
“Everything’s okay. He’s in first class.”

741
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:54,518
And then I turned around
and told the guy...

742
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,230
“It’s fine. Everything’s okay.

743
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,401
I gave her 20 bucks.”

744
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,988
