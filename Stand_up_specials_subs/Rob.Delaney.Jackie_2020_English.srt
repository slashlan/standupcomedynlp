1
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,400
Hey, hey, hey!

2
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,800
Hello there!

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,600
Hi!

4
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,480
Hi there, nice people.

5
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,960
Nice to see you all.
How are you doing?

6
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,360
All right.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Good to be here in London.
Good to be here.

8
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,720
I mean, I live here,
but it's still good to be here.

9
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,200
Could have died today.
Could have been eaten by a wolf.

10
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,640
But that didn't happen,

11
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,640
and I got to come here
and be with you.

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,440
It's pissing out there, huh?

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,440
You know, it's funny

14
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,600
I knew that it would rain
when I moved to London,

15
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,320
and rain
doesn't really bother me.

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,080
I saw Mary Poppins,
I know that that happens.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,400
But what they don't tell you

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,960
is that the sun sets just
after lunch for half the year.

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,200
They don't put that
in the brochure,

20
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,920
and it's really awful.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,000
Also, I almost fell down
the flight of stairs

22
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,040
before I walked out here,
cos they're old.

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,600
This place is beautiful,
but it's old,

24
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,760
and the stairs are also old.

25
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,640
My wife and I recently watched
a Channel 5 documentary

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,560
called "Dangers
of the Victorian Home",

27
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,160
and the BBC gets all the credit
for the slick documentaries,

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,680
and they are great,
but Channel 5 is...

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,240
That's the uncut shit.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,440
So good and so weird.

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,880
"Dangers of the Victorian Home"
was mostly about one thing -

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,400
stairs.

33
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,400
That's how you died
in Victorian times,

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
cos they didn't have
zoning codes and stuff

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,680
so you just built whatever:
"Yeah, those are stairs."

36
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,680
And then you could build them
out of anything

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,360
and there wasn't
uniformity to them,

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,240
so people just constantly
fall through them,

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,440
down them, up them,
and that's how you died.

40
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,760
The best part
of the documentary was,

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,840
they went to
some fucking stair lab,

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,400
and they had a staircase built,
but they can adjust it,

43
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,560
they can adjust like the depth
and the pitch of the steps.

44
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,560
So they make it normal and
they have a lady walk down it

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,560
and they're like, "Pretty easy,
huh? What if we did this?"

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,680
And then they, like,
fuck with the third step

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,760
and she walks down
and she's like, "Argh!"

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,400
Falls into some cushions
and she's like,

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,400
"In Victorian times, you'd have
been impaled on a bunch of stuff

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,960
"and you would've died."

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,120
And anyway,

52
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,600
nice to see you all, thank you.

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,680
Thank you.

54
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,960
I was in my backyard recently
with my three kids,

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,520
and I was watering some weeds,

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,800
and I heard a crunching noise,
a very loud crunching noise,

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,560
and my one-year-old
had found a garden snail

58
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,960
and killed it
and was eating it

59
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,560
and enjoying it.

60
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,720
And it made wonderful noises,

61
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,200
cos he was crunching
through the shell

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,680
and then through just the raw,
moist escargot sushi

63
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,160
and so it's quite
a symphony of noises,

64
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,600
but I don't know
if you're supposed to do that,

65
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,480
so I went to take it
out of his mouth.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,960
And at that moment
my eight-year-old

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,560
punched my six-year-old
in the face.

68
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,320
And I had a hose,

69
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,760
so I hosed the eight-year-old
aggressively.

70
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,120
I blasted him against the wall
and held him there for a second

71
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,080
and he was very upset,
understandably,

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,480
I shouldn't have hosed him,

73
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,160
but if you punch my beautiful
six-year-old in the face,

74
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,760
I'm gonna fucking hose you,
even if you're also my son.

75
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,040
And so I held him against
the wall for a little bit,

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,560
then I let go, took my thumb off
and he slid down the wall.

77
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
And he was livid!

78
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,000
And he marched over
to me and the baby,

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,920
and he points at the baby
and looks in my eyes and goes,

80
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,640
"I'm gonna teach him
to hate you."

81
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,120
So now I have, like,
a comic book nemesis...

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,080
living in my house with me.

83
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,120
I'm scared.

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,080
I didn't realise it at the time,

85
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,480
but I'd made a terrible error
a few weeks before that.

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,360
We had gone to
some cider festival in a forest,

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,920
and one of the activities
that they had was,

88
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,480
you could give a guy £3
and then he'd give you some axes

89
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,320
that you could throw
at a target.

90
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,720
And so I did it,
and I threw the axes,

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
and I hit the target every time.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,000
The blade never sank
into the wood,

93
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,080
but it would hit it sideways
and clang to the ground.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,880
If I threw an axe like that
at you, the way I throw them,

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,480
you wouldn't be hurt,
you'd just be like, "Oi...!

96
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,480
"Hey, hey, that's a nuisance."

97
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,360
And so I didn't do a good job.

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,360
But then my son,
my eight-year-old was like,

99
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,160
"Hey, Daddy, can I do it?"
And I was like,

100
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,120
"I can't imagine he's gonna
let an eight-year-old do it."

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,880
So I said to the guy,
"He can't do it, can he?"

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,080
He's like, "If he's got £3,

103
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,000
"I don't give a shit
who does it."

104
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,520
And so I gave the guy £3,
and then my son took the axe,

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,240
he's just fucking
foom, foom, foom, foom...

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,760
and sunk them all!

107
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,920
And so now
that we're nemeses,

108
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,040
I know that one day...

109
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
Like, when I die, you don't
have to read the obituary,

110
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,720
it's just gonna be fucking
three axes to the forehead,

111
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
one to the heart,
one to each testicle,

112
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,480
and that's it.
That's how it's gonna be.

113
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,480
I was walking around with all
three of them a few weeks ago,

114
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,080
and we're walking down
the sidewalk at dusk,

115
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,720
the most dangerous time,

116
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,480
and a guy approaches us,

117
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
and he's kinda shuffling along,
looks like he's in trouble,

118
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,440
and I noticed that he's bleeding
from his temple.

119
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,880
So, I'm a nice person,

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,920
so I said,
"Sir, can we help you?"

121
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
And he goes,

122
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,280
"Oh, you know, if I could just
get £5 on my oyster card,

123
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,640
"then I'm sure I could..."

124
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,640
And I'm like,
"You fucking scammer!"

125
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,800
And so I gave him the money,

126
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,480
I didn't want deal with it,
I had all the kids...

127
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,840
But my boys are upset,

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,880
they're like,
"He's really in trouble, Daddy."

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
And I’m like, "No, he's not!

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,920
"He's not gonna use
that money to ride the train,

131
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,800
"he's not even hurt,
he's gonna use the money

132
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,320
"to buy cocaine powder
for him and his friends.

133
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,120
"We've been scammed, boys."

134
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,320
They're like, "Huh?"

135
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,320
Like they're young
and they're good people,

136
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,680
so they were like, "No, really,
we have to help him harder.

137
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,440
"You gotta chase him down."
And I’m like, "No."

138
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
And so you can see inside,

139
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,560
their picture of me
is just crumbling

140
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,480
because they think
I don't wanna help the guy.

141
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,480
Anyway, we're all having crises,

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,000
as I'm like, "I think
the guy was scamming us,

143
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,640
"but I'm not 100% certain."

144
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,400
So I'm all fucked up,
and so then...

145
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,160
we go around the corner

146
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,160
and a little while later
I see the guy again.

147
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,760
So I grab the boys,
and we all hide behind the bench

148
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,040
and I go, "You just watch,
just watch him."

149
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,280
And so this time, the guy's
walking down the street,

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,600
and he's like,
"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah..."

151
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,280
And then he identifies a mark,
so he enfeebles himself

152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,200
and then walks up,
and he's like...

153
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,280
And I'm like,
"See, what did I tell you!"

154
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,760
And the boys are like, "Huh..."
Now they think we're, like, MI6.

155
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,200
We went home and they were like,
"Daddy teach us more scams."

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,600
So I'm running a scam college
out of the basement.

157
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,280
I went for a jog recently,

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,880
and I was running
along the canal,

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
and I’m jogging,
having a good time,

160
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,800
canal to my left,
some bushes to my right,

161
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,800
and I see a guy
standing in the bushes,

162
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,440
kind of on the edge,

163
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,240
and he's got his penis out.

164
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,760
And it's a nice penis.

165
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,760
It's a nice British penis,

166
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,400
which is to say
it wasn't circumcised, you know,

167
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,120
and I love a good British penis.

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,880
It's like a little breadstick
in a sock or something.

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,240
It's nice.

170
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,280
I looked at it with envy
because my penis is gross.

171
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,520
You know, I'm circumcised,
cos in the '70s in America

172
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,520
they just cut some of
your dick off when you're born,

173
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,360
and so my dick is...
it's all scar tissue.

174
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,040
It kind of looks like
if you dropped a cheese Danish

175
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,960
on a barber shop floor...

176
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,400
...and there's,
like, a toenail in it.

177
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,040
I mean, it's just...

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,200
I mean,
my penis isn't totally off,

179
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,160
there are some cool things
about my penis.

180
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,760
It can be like a bunch
of different sizes for one.

181
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,280
Like, at its biggest
it's nothing remarkable,

182
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,960
but it's recognisable
as a human penis,

183
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,080
you don't have to take a picture
of it and send it to your mom

184
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,520
and be like, "Any ideas?"
you know.

185
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,400
And like, "Nah,
he's doing the best he can."

186
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
That's the biggest,

187
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:25,840
and then it can be a bunch of...
like, 40 different sizes

188
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,880
down to really alarmingly small.

189
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
If it's cold out and I’m near
a body of water, it's like...

190
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,360
like a little white oily almond.

191
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,840
It isn't actually oily,
but it's just, like, shiny.

192
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,400
Like when you see a snake,
you think, "It's gonna be slimy"

193
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,840
and then you touch it
and you're like, "Oh, it isn't."

194
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,880
But you can only rub it in
one direction cos of the scales.

195
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,320
It's like that.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,280
Anyway...

197
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,200
You know, it's funny,
my boys aren't circumcised,

198
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,640
and so whenever they see
my penis they're like, "Ugh!"

199
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,440
I mean, I don't wake them up
in the middle of the night

200
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,600
and be like,
"Look at your father's penis!"

201
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,640
I mean, if it, like, flops out
on the couch or whatever

202
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,760
and they're like, "Daddy,
what is wrong with your penis?"

203
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,440
And I'm like,
"Woah, where do I begin."

204
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,520
They're mad at my parents
for circumcising me.

205
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,760
They're like, "What did they do
when the doctor went to do it?"

206
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,000
And I was like, "I think
they asked him to do it!"

207
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,640
When my mom visits and
asks them to clean their room,

208
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,360
they're, like,
furiously tidying.

209
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,880
"Look, I'm tidying.
It's clean! It's clean!"

210
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,080
Anyway, so... I'm running along,

211
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,720
I see the penis, I enjoy it.
I keep jogging.

212
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,000
And... but then I'm like,
"Wait, you know what?

213
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,720
"I'm not the only person
who uses this path."

214
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,520
For me, not a big deal, just
a little penis, how do you do,

215
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,760
but for everybody else
that could really be upsetting.

216
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,440
You know, if it's a mom
with kids and stuff.

217
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,760
I don't want that
to happen to them.

218
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,880
So I'm thinking in my mind,
"What do I say?

219
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,600
"How do I warn people
about the penis?"

220
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,200
I don't want 'em to trip over it
and fall in the river and die.

221
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,040
It's such a thin strip
of a thing -

222
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
you either fall in the river

223
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,280
or you have to go in the woods
and live with him, so...

224
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,080
I run along thinking, like,
"OK, this guy's penis coming up,

225
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,160
"six o'clock, please look out."
You know, and...

226
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,160
But then I'm, like,
I've been running for a while,

227
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,360
and I’m big and sweaty...

228
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,200
If I approach you on a canal,
you're already like, "Oh, no..."

229
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,040
I was like, "Er..."

230
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,800
So I just didn't say anything,
I let people see the dick guy

231
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
because
that's just one bad thing

232
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,560
that happened to them that day
instead of two.

233
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,560
Me, you know, accosting them
and penises.

234
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,760
My wife ran out of eyeliner
recently,

235
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,760
so I called the police.

236
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,720
No, I was actually going
to the mall, and so she said,

237
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,840
"Can you get me some eyeliner?"
and I was like, "Yeah."

238
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,040
And so she was like, "OK,
look, this is the one I want."

239
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,720
She shows me
her empty eyeliner thing.

240
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,640
"I want this one,
don't want a different one.

241
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,720
"If they don't have this one,
don't get any at all,

242
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,040
"for this is the one
that I require."

243
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,600
And I was like, "OK."

244
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,520
And so
I had the boys with me,

245
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,360
and we go into the store,

246
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,440
and a guy comes up to me,
he's like, "Can I help you?"

247
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,320
And I'm like, "I don't know."
I tell him about the eyeliner.

248
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,800
He's like,
"I think we got that."

249
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,120
He takes me over
to the eyeliner hutch,

250
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,680
and he's digging around.

251
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,240
He's like "Oh, you know what,
I think we're out of that one."

252
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,760
And I'm like,
"Well, then I'll see you later."

253
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,480
And he's like "No, no, no,
but we have others."

254
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,200
And then he summoned women who
work there who had eyeliner on,

255
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,600
and I felt I could trust them.

256
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,880
And so they encircle me

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,880
and I’m getting hypnotised
and confused.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And my boys are like,
"Daddy, we gotta go."

259
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,400
And then one women is like,
"This one is very similar.

260
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,760
"It's just missing...
it's got one different isotope,

261
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,040
"and I think
that she'll love it."

262
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,760
And I'm like, "OK," so I buy it,

263
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,240
and my kids are like,
"Fucking..."

264
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,840
And I go home,
and I present it to my wife,

265
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,160
and she sees it,
and she's like...

266
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,400
And she just spit on it
and stuck it up my asshole.

267
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,760
But that story should not
reflect negatively on her, OK?

268
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,520
Seriously,
she has a preference,

269
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,160
she wants this one,
she doesn't want that one.

270
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,240
That's normal,
people have preferences.

271
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I'm not like that.

272
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,360
I just live in garbage,
I don't care.

273
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,040
If I'm at a restaurant
and I order a Coke

274
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,480
and they're like, "Oh, we don't
have Coke. Is Pepsi OK?"

275
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,320
I'm like, "I don't give a shit
if you piss in a bucket

276
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,960
"as long as you pour
a bag of sugar in with it

277
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,320
"and mix it in, OK?

278
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
"I want sugar and bubbles
that I can pour down my throat

279
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,200
"that will coat the grained meat
I've eaten earlier

280
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,360
"and bind with it
and create a compound

281
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,720
"that will make me forget
about my life for 20 minutes.

282
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,240
"So, yes, Pepsi is fine."

283
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,760
I wish that
that there were a joke.

284
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,640
I wish that weren't
how I live with my life.

285
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,720
I signed up
to chaperone a field trip

286
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,280
for my six-year-old
not too long ago,

287
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,320
and the day
of the field trip came

288
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,160
and my son was sick.

289
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,160
Normally when my kids are sick,
I just tell 'em

290
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,000
to go be sick at school.
I don't wanna deal with it.

291
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,320
But he was quite sick,
so we had to keep him home,

292
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,600
and then the school called
and they were like,

293
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,440
"It would be great
if you could still chaperone

294
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,600
"because a couple of chaperones
dropped out."

295
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
I was like, "Oh, Christ!"

296
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,440
And so I had to chaperone
a field trip

297
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,640
that I didn't have
a child of my own on.

298
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,720
I had no skin in the game

299
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,960
and I really found out
just what a piece of shit I am.

300
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,640
I had never been checked out
of a situation more in my life.

301
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,400
Like, we get into the museum

302
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,880
and the kids are walking
through a turnstile

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,400
to enter the museum, right?

304
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,720
And so the woman at the thing
pushes the button

305
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,840
to de-electrify the turnstile

306
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,160
so that it can spin and allow
the children through, OK?

307
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
So they're all coming through
and then the final kid in line,

308
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,280
he's kind of short
and she didn't see him.

309
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
So she took her finger
off the thing,

310
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,840
electricity surged
through the bar

311
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,040
and became
an impenetrable steel wall

312
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,640
and so then the kid's
approaching.

313
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,920
I watched him approach it
for 15 seconds minimum,

314
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,560
didn't say a fucking thing

315
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,520
and just clang,
watched him get taken out.

316
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,640
Didn't give a shit.

317
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,800
I let a kid eat a cigarette.

318
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Not mine.

319
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,120
I mean not my kid,
it was my cigarette.

320
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,120
So a couple of years ago,

321
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,040
my wife and I went to the
National Air and Space Museum

322
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,840
in Washington DC,

323
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,840
and one fun thing
that they have there is,

324
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,400
they have the hall of weights
and measures,

325
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,120
and they have different scales

326
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,920
that are calibrated to show you
what you would weigh

327
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,520
on different planets
in the solar system.

328
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,120
So there's, like, Jupiter,

329
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,080
which is huge,
has a lot of gravity.

330
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,080
You stand on it,
there's a massive number,

331
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,360
and you're like, "Oh, my God!

332
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,800
"Imagine if I weighed
as much as a truck."

333
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,480
And then they've got the moon,

334
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
which is a tiny little
celestial body.

335
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,760
So you stand on that one,
it's a wee little number,

336
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,960
and you're like,
"I'm just a feather," you know?

337
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,520
And then they have Earth,
and I...

338
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,960
I don't know
why you're laughing.

339
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,240
So I stood on Earth,

340
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,320
and the number
was fucking huge.

341
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,840
And I was like, "What?"
And I summoned my wife.

342
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,680
"Honey, look at this,"
and I was like, "This is crazy."

343
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,880
In the hall
of weights and measures,

344
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,640
the Earth scale is broken.

345
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,360
She's like, "No,
I think that might really be

346
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
"exactly what you weigh."
And I was like, "Oh, we'll see."

347
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,960
So we went home and I took out
a scale I hadn't seen in years,

348
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,320
dusted it off and stood on it.
Same number.

349
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,120
Now, what had happened is,
I had become fat.

350
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,640
Well, I'd become medically fat,

351
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,760
and there had been
warning signs, you know, like,

352
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,080
you ever take off your pants
at the end of the day

353
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,800
and you have like a red band
around your waist?

354
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
That wasn't the sign.

355
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,680
What would happen is,
I would take off the pants,

356
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
see the red band and then
go to sleep for eight hours,

357
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,160
wake up the next day -
red band still there.

358
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,320
So, like, it was getting hard
to do shoes and stuff.

359
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,560
I mean,
I knew there was a problem.

360
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,960
Also, all my pants
were so fucking tight.

361
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,920
They were like tight
to the point of pain,

362
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,080
but if I bent over,
they would pop off my ass

363
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,800
and fall down to the floor.

364
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Sort of like restrictively,
unbelievably, painted on tight,

365
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,800
bend over, pop,

366
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,480
and then just a denim bed sheet
on the ground.

367
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,080
So I was like,
"Shit, I gotta do something."

368
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,880
So I started to lose weight,

369
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
and the way I did it was,
I just ate less.

370
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,960
I wish that I could tell you
I went on a retreat

371
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,400
or did tapes or used a lozenge.

372
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,800
None of that stuff is real,
you just have to eat less

373
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,640
and I thought exercise
had something to do with it.

374
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,320
Exercise has nothing
to do with it.

375
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,400
Once you get to a certain age,
you just exercise all the time.

376
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,920
I still exercised
when I was fat.

377
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,800
Didn't fucking matter if you eat
buckets of garbage each day.

378
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,800
So I just started eating less
and it was really, really awful

379
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,320
and... particularly at night.

380
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,040
At night, my stomach would start
to growl and I'd be like,

381
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,320
"I'm gonna eat something,
something's going in here."

382
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,480
And so what it would do is,
when I was asleep,

383
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,640
it would start to suck
dreams and memories

384
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,680
out of my mind and my soul

385
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,760
and just digest
and destroy them.

386
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
So sleep time
just became fucking awful.

387
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,200
I had horrible nightmares,

388
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,080
I hated going to sleep
every night.

389
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,560
I remember one of the worst
nightmares that I had was,

390
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,200
I was just walking down
the street somewhere

391
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,800
and all of a sudden
a guy pulled up in a van

392
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,760
and he jumped out
and took out a gun

393
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,440
and held it up to my head
and said,

394
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,520
"If you can't make 15 people
in this neighbourhood

395
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,880
"let you be their dentist,

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,440
"I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out."

397
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,280
And I was like, "Oh, my God!"

398
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,960
And it was, like, so realistic.
So I'm like, "Oh, my God!"

399
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,720
So I'm running up
to people being like,

400
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,000
"Let me be your dentist."

401
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,760
And I'm not doing
any soft sell stuff,

402
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,480
like you're supposed to do
to like get new business.

403
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,280
Normally you'd be like, "Hey,
nice choppers you got there.

404
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,800
"Yeah, well, I'm new in town,

405
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,880
"and it turns out I dent,
and I was wondering if maybe..."

406
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
None of that shit, just,
"Let me be your dentist!"

407
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,400
So people are like, "God, no!"

408
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,880
And then I was like,
"You know what?

409
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,240
"I think what it is
is, I'm too big and scary.

410
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
"I need to pretend
to be a little girl."

411
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,000
So I don't even... in my dream,
I have no magic powers,

412
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,960
so I just get on my knees and
start to speak in a high voice

413
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
and be like,
"Let me be your dentist."

414
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,880
And then people are like,
"Definitely not now!

415
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,080
"I'd rather have the big...
what the fuck, you know."

416
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,320
So then the guy's coming for me,
he's got the gun,

417
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,080
he's pointing at his watch
and I’m fucking shitting.

418
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,960
So I go up to people's windows
who haven't seen me yet,

419
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,440
and I’m going like,
"Let me be your dentist."

420
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,560
And so he's coming
and he's, like, cocking the gun,

421
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,320
and so in the climax
of the dream,

422
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,880
in the cutest little voice
I can possibly do, I scream,

423
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,960
"Let me be your dentist."

424
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,880
But I also do it in real life,

425
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,760
in my bed
with my human wife on earth

426
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,440
and so she's like,
"What's the matter?"

427
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,640
And I was like,
"I'm fucking hungry!"

428
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
So awful.

429
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,000
Ahh...

430
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,760
Um, there's a weird thing
that they do in America,

431
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,920
one weird thing... that they do

432
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,800
and it's every year,

433
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,320
the President of
the United States has a physical

434
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
and then they release the data,
for some reason.

435
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,800
So every year on one day

436
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,000
they just tell you the height
and weight of the President.

437
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Don't know why they do it.

438
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,200
When they did it with Obama,
I was like, "Don't care,"

439
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,440
now they do it with Trump,
I'm like, "Double don't care."

440
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,080
And I remember about a year ago,
they released the data

441
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,720
and he said that he was 6'3''
and weighed 237 pounds, OK?

442
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,560
Now when people heard that,
they were like, "Excuse me?"

443
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,440
Like, people were like,
"That's impossible.

444
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,800
"It's impossible
that he only weighs 237 pounds,

445
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,800
"if you look
at his dimensions and stuff."

446
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,000
But people all think pieces
and stuff, people were like,

447
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,880
"I don't know, maybe
if you strain so hard

448
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,400
"to not say the N word
all day every day,

449
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,200
"your body fills
with like a racist gas

450
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,800
"that lifts you up
and makes you lighter."

451
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,800
Maybe that's what happened.

452
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,680
However...

453
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,720
On that day, however,
in my weight loss journey

454
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,920
I was 6'3'' and it so happened
I weighed exactly 237 pounds,

455
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,400
so I knew he was lying.
So I was livid.

456
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,200
I was like naked standing
in the mirror screaming,

457
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,320
being like,
"The President's a liar."

458
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
Whenever Trump
comes on television,

459
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,000
I just turn it off,
cos I love myself,

460
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
I don't wanna hear that shit.

461
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,880
But I was thinking
it'd be kinda funny

462
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,800
if I was somewhere where
I couldn't turn the TV off,

463
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,320
like if I'm at a laundromat
or an airport.

464
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,920
What if we were all somewhere
where we couldn't turn it off

465
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,480
and we had to see
what he had to say?

466
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,480
So he comes on,
and we're like, "All right."

467
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,080
And then he starts to blather
and you're like, "Huh."

468
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,440
But then something happens
behind his eyes,

469
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,760
so we all kinda lean in,

470
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,080
and then suddenly
he's like, "Beugh..."

471
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,720
And then you're like,
"Oh, my God,

472
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,480
"is he having a fatal
cerebral aneurysm?"

473
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
And I was thinking,
"How lovely would that be for us

474
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,800
"to just all together
watch him die

475
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,600
"to death and be dead?
How great would that be?"

476
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,720
Then Eric and Don Junior run out

477
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,600
and they're trying to do CPR,
but they've never studied it,

478
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,160
they don't give a shit
about anyone

479
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,240
so they don't know how to do it,
but any excuse to touch him

480
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,000
because he hasn't hugged them
in 30 years.

481
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,240
So they're just like, "Argh..."

482
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,760
But it doesn't work,

483
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,440
his skin is getting greyer, and
his eyes are getting cloudier

484
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,520
cos he's fucking dead.

485
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,600
I love that premise.
I do.

486
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,880
I want that.

487
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:47,040
So we've lived in the UK now
for a little over five years,

488
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,320
and I’m pretty crazy about it.

489
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,920
I love the monarchy

490
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,280
because fuck them,
they should not exist.

491
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,760
But...

492
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,000
But...

493
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,760
What's good about
the monarchy is,

494
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,960
they let you know from birth

495
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,720
that the deck
is fucking stacked.

496
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,600
Born in the ditch,
die in the ditch, right?

497
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,440
If there's anything
in your wallet,

498
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,840
the Queen's face is on it.
I love that.

499
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,360
In America, people are like,

500
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,160
"If you can dream it,
you can do it."

501
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,120
Where the fuck
did they get that idea?

502
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,280
Also, I think it's good

503
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,840
that Nazi bombs
fell on your grandparents

504
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,360
and I’ll tell you why.

505
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,920
Because in America,
like, the day before 9/11,

506
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,160
the governor of Florida
was like, "Fuck that Gomorrah,"

507
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,920
but then as soon as 9/11
happened, he was like,

508
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,120
"Oh, we can have a war?
Oh, New York."

509
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,080
And so, here...

510
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,160
if terrorists blow up
the bus in front of your bus,

511
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,200
you're like, "Hmm...

512
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,520
"It would appear
I will still make it to work."

513
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,400
I mean that's cool,
you're stalwarts.

514
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,320
Also you guys have the NHS,
which is just fucking amazing.

515
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,480
Cos...

516
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,280
Cos in America,
if you get a sick,

517
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,000
even if you have good private...
"good" private insurance,

518
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,600
you still have to take
your credit cards

519
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,800
and your mom's credit cards and
your neighbours' credit cards

520
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:27,040
and melt them down
and fashion them into a kayak

521
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,880
that you paddle
into the hospital

522
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,640
and beg them to help you.

523
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,160
Maybe they don't, maybe they do,

524
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,920
but if they do, you still leave
with so much medical debt

525
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,760
that you have no choice
but to kill yourself.

526
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,800
Whereas with the NHS, if you're
sick, you go into the hospital,

527
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,600
and you're like,
"Yeah, something's wrong."

528
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,720
And they're like,
"Well, no promises,

529
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,400
"but we'll take a look."

530
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,560
We'll take a look!

531
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,280
Ah! You'll take a look,
thank you.

532
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,000
Because seriously, in America,

533
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,240
like, if something goes wrong
with your eye or your knee,

534
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,520
all right that's step one.

535
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,360
Step two is,
you immediately become filled

536
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,320
with molten hot diarrhoea
that blasts out of your asshole

537
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,720
cos you're so terrified

538
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,200
of what's gonna happen
to you financially.

539
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,480
You have to put on 15 diapers
and waddle into the hospital,

540
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,240
be like, "Ah..."
and they're like, "Oh, God."

541
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,200
And you're like,
"No, it's my knee."

542
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,800
Fucking nightmare!

543
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,560
If the NHS had a dick,
I would suck that dick.

544
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,840
I would.

545
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,840
I would take it
in my mouth soft

546
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,400
and start to hum a little Sade.

547
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,640
Suck it.
I'd suck it down my gullet.

548
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,840
I would suck it down.
I would suck it so hard

549
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,320
it would poke out my
belly button and wink at you.

550
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,520
It would.

551
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,720
If the NHS had a pussy...

552
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,120
Fucking...

553
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,240
Scuba dive in that thing.

554
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,280
I don't know, look,
why am I gendering the NHS?

555
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,280
Obviously it's greater
than male or female.

556
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
Maybe the NHS has a cloaca,
you know?

557
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,000
Where my farmers at?

558
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,560
Well if you don't know
what a cloaca is,

559
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,680
it's the hole in a bird that
everything comes out of, right?

560
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
Pretty cool!

561
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,200
Well, if you've ever been
shit on by a bird

562
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,200
and been like, "Hey, good luck!"
Not really!

563
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,000
Because you were not
just shit on.

564
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,320
Yes, you were shit on,
but you were also pissed on,

565
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,200
the bird also
jerked off on you,

566
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
it also made an omelette
and threw that at you.

567
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,080
So if you've been so thoroughly
degraded and owned by that bird

568
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,240
that you should just
chase it down the street

569
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,440
and beg it
to merely shit on you.

570
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,080
I'm trying to dress nicer
on stage when I perform

571
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,360
cos a guy came up to me
after a show not too long ago,

572
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,720
and he goes, "Hey, great show,
but wanted to let you know

573
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,480
"there's a hole
in the armpit of your shirt."

574
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,480
And I was like, "Oh, really?"

575
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,640
And I looked to see
which one it was. It was both.

576
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,560
I had holes
in both armpits of my shirt

577
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,480
cos I just wear clothes
until they fall apart.

578
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,680
Like, I'm clean,
I observe hygiene,

579
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,200
but clothes with holes,
who cares?

580
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,680
Particularly boxers.
I will wear a pair of boxers

581
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,440
until they're just a rubber band
around my waist

582
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,320
and just hanging
bolts of fabric.

583
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,840
So that I can stand
over the toilet

584
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,880
and just sigh my contents
out of my cloaca.

585
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,360
Anyway, I'm trying
not to do that anymore, though,

586
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,880
cos a few months ago,
I was lying in bed reading

587
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,080
and my wife came into the
bedroom and she goes, "Ugh...

588
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,240
"You're bleeding
from your vagina."

589
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,040
And I wanted to see
what she saw.

590
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,720
I don't have a vagina,
so I was curious.

591
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,560
It was pretty awful
what she saw.

592
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,800
Basically, I was wearing
a pair of boxers

593
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,320
that I got in maybe 1991.

594
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,120
And when I got them,
they were bright red,

595
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,960
fire engine red,
they were the talk of the town,

596
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
just a beautiful garment.

597
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,080
And then
in the decades that passed,

598
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,440
they started to fade and become
like a nice salmon colour

599
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,360
and then like a light pink.

600
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,600
And then about a year ago,
they tore up the middle -

601
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,760
not a problem.

602
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,000
And then after that,

603
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,080
the original bright red
fabric thread tendrils

604
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
began to peak out the sides.

605
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,760
So what my wife saw
was pink, pink

606
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,160
and then a gaping red wound

607
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,440
and then just a bunch of fur
and meat and garbage.

608
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,480
So I threw them away,

609
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,120
not cos she's my wife,
but, you know, she's a person,

610
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,200
and you wouldn't do that
to a roommate.

611
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,760
Another thing
I like about the UK

612
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,480
is that you can order
your groceries online here.

613
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,320
I think you can
now do it in America,

614
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,280
but when I moved here
five years ago, you couldn't.

615
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,520
And the reason that it started
here is population density.

616
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,480
We're all this close to each
other right now in this theatre,

617
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,680
but when we leave here tonight,

618
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,000
we'll still all be exactly
this close to each other.

619
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,120
And it took them a while to
figure it out in America though

620
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,880
because in America it's,
like, person...

621
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,880
three farms... another person.

622
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,720
Plus if you ring a doorbell
in America,

623
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,520
you just get shot twice
in the face

624
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,440
and then they try to figure out,

625
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,360
"Hey, I wonder why he rang
my doorbell?" So...

626
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,720
Anyway, I love ordering
my groceries online.

627
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,920
It's pretty great.
It's not perfect.

628
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,840
Like, not too long ago,
I was doing the weekly shop,

629
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,920
and I got to mint tea.

630
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
And I typically spend
a while on the mint tea page -

631
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,920
I drink a lot of mint tea,
you can probably tell.

632
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,720
And something
was wrong, though.

633
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,600
It was super expensive this week
and I couldn't figure out why.

634
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,200
But then I was like, "Are they
gonna deliver it to this couch,

635
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,120
"then I don't care
if it's £300, order."

636
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,800
And the next day I found out
why it was so expensive,

637
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,040
when they had delivered to me
a pallet of mint tea.

638
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,440
OK?

639
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,720
I now own all the mint tea
in Greater Metropolitan London.

640
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,920
If you want mint tea now,
you gotta come to me.

641
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,240
And so, I'm drinking it like
crazy. I'm just going bananas,

642
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
I'm not making it
the treat that it should be,

643
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,880
I'm bathing in it,
I'm just going insane.

644
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,480
And a while back my wife and I
were gonna watch some TV,

645
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,600
and so I made the tea
and she made popcorn,

646
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,840
and I finished first.

647
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,400
And so I'm walking back
into the living room

648
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,720
to sit down and watch TV.

649
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,000
I’m just kinda waltzing along

650
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,400
not being careful
with my mint tea

651
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,440
on account of
I've got so darn much of it.

652
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,760
And I plop down on the couch
and I immediately spill

653
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,680
the whole cup
of boiling water right here.

654
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,000
None got on my thighs or stomach
just 100% on the C and B.

655
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,160
and fortunately there was
a glass of water

656
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,680
on the table next to me,

657
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,400
so I just tore my trousers off

658
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,920
and stuck my dick and balls
into the glass of water.

659
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,360
I was like, "Oh..."

660
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,880
like the way that you would
think you would fuck a woman

661
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,280
when you first hear about sex
when you're like six years old.

662
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,600
I'm like, "OK,"

663
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,280
so I put my soft penis
and testicles inside her

664
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,760
and then I scream
into her mouth, OK.

665
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,800
And then, at that moment,
my wife came in with the popcorn

666
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,000
and she goes, "What happened?"

667
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,680
And this is what I said, I go,

668
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,920
"I think
it's pretty fucking obvious!"

669
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,960
And she just pirouetted
with the popcorn

670
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,800
and walked back
into the kitchen.

671
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,800
And then I kinda calmed down

672
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,080
and realised there might not be
any permanent damage

673
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,240
and then I realised,
"You know what?

674
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,720
"It might not be perfectly
obvious what has happened.

675
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,320
"It might
not be perfectly obvious."

676
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,040
Meanwhile,
she's come face to face

677
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:18,360
with a fucking aquarium
of nightmares. So...

678
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,520
I had to do something
I don't like to do,

679
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,080
which is apologise.

680
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,760
I don't like to do it,
but I do it.

681
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,040
I... honestly,
"I'm sorry," what is that?

682
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,480
Like, vapour
and sound waves, right?

683
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
You'd think it probably
weighs nothing, right?

684
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,040
If you added up all the
I'm sorrys I've said to my wife,

685
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,880
I promise it would
weigh 700 metric tons, OK?

686
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,240
Whereas
she's never said it once.

687
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,960
I've literally
never heard her say it.

688
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,040
Honestly, I swear to God, when
she dies in a fire in February,

689
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:50,240
I think that the coroner
is gonna be like,

690
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,360
"Mr Delaney, come here."

691
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,880
And I'll be like, "Yeah?
and he'll be like,

692
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,120
"If you notice,
if you look in the oral cavity

693
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,480
"where the soft
and hard palates meet,

694
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
"from the structure

695
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,720
"she actually couldn't produce
the words 'I'm sorry',

696
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,120
"she couldn't
make the noise 'I'm sorry',

697
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,320
"that's why you never heard it,
you stupid asshole."

698
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,320
All right.

699
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,120
Good,
so you're drinking some wine.

700
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,000
I don't drink anymore,
I quit drinking 17 years ago,

701
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,960
after I drove a car

702
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,880
into the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power,

703
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,080
a building I'd always hated.

704
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,720
And...

705
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,120
No one else was involved
in the accident, thank goodness,

706
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,640
but I was pretty badly hurt.

707
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,160
I broke both my arms,
and my legs were not broken,

708
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,960
but they were ripped open
to the bone.

709
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,840
So in the emergency room,
they had to sew 'em up

710
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,400
and then they put me
in these leg stabiliser tubes,

711
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,720
so I couldn't bend my knees,

712
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,200
and then they put me in a
wheelchair and sent me to jail.

713
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,440
And in jail, the law
of gravity still applies,

714
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,160
and so sometimes I would start
to slide out of the wheelchair,

715
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,960
and I couldn't bend my knees
to stop the slide,

716
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,520
nor could I use my arms
to do anything.

717
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,880
So I'd be sliding out

718
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,880
and then my bloody
hospital gown would come up

719
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,520
and expose
my penis and testicles

720
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,960
and even my cute little butthole
to everybody in jail.

721
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,600
And I don't know if you guys
have read any books about jail

722
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,480
or seen any movies about it.

723
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,000
You're actually supposed
to keep that stuff to yourself.

724
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,440
So what would happen is,
some big thugs would pick me up

725
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,640
and put me back
in the wheelchair.

726
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,280
They wouldn't try to fuck me
or anything

727
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,280
cos even in jail they still like
the thrill of seduction.

728
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,440
You don't wanna be
shooting fish in a barrel.

729
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,680
So they'd pick me up and
put me back in the wheelchair,

730
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,640
and then they'd be like,
"When you get better..."

731
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,800
And then I'd be like,
"You guys are nuts,

732
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
"and thank you."

733
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,040
And then I had a court date,

734
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,400
and the judge was like,
"So how's jail?"

735
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,080
And I was like,
"I'm gonna be honest with you,

736
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,320
"I don't care for it."

737
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,640
and he was like, "You know what,
why don't we put you

738
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,760
"in the chemical dependency unit
of a psychiatric hospital?"

739
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,960
And I was like,
"That sounds more my speed."

740
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,640
And so they put me there,
and it was great. I loved it.

741
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,680
I fucking loved
living in the hospital.

742
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,000
Honestly, I can't wait
to live in a hospital again

743
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,360
and move into a nursing home.

744
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,600
I'm seriously gonna
move in when I'm 49.

745
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,160
My mom's like, "If they ever try
to put me in a nursing home,

746
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
"just shoot me in the head."
And I'm like, "All right."

747
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,160
But I honestly...
I really can't wait to go.

748
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,640
I mean, cos they got salad bars
and stuff.

749
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,640
At the salad bar
at this hospital,

750
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,880
they had cottage cheese
available for every meal,

751
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,320
and I've never bought cottage
cheese on my own in my life,

752
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,640
but if it's on offer
at every meal,

753
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,760
I'm fucking eating it
at every meal.

754
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,960
So I'm shovelling
cottage cheese into my mouth

755
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,440
at eight o'clock in the morning,
making new crazy friends,

756
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,080
it was the best.

757
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,000
Oh, another reason I wanna live
in a nursing home is

758
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,040
cos in nursing homes
you can fuck.

759
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,480
I don't know if you knew this,
but they're riddled with STDs.

760
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,160
Like seriously, everybody...

761
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,320
They fuck and a lot of them
have replacement hips and stuff,

762
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,160
so you really gotta hit it.

763
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,600
They won't even know
that you're there, so...

764
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,640
And then if you get into trouble
and they're like, "Mr Delaney!",

765
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,120
you can be like, "Oh, did I now?
I don't remember."

766
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,920
And then just scoot off
into the sunset.

767
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,400
But anyway,
the hospital was great.

768
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,840
But I had two broken arms
and I was in casts

769
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,480
from my knuckles
up to my shoulders on both arms,

770
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,160
and so people would ask me,

771
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,840
the most popular questions
that I got asked were,

772
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,160
"How do you wipe your ass?"
and "How do you jerk off?"

773
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,640
The way that I wiped my ass was
not really all that well

774
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,920
and it hurt a lot
to even attempt,

775
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,200
so I'd have to get
in the shower.

776
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,760
So every shit
took 90 minutes, and...

777
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,400
as opposed to the normal 70
that they take now.

778
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,320
And then they would ask,
"How do you jerk off?"

779
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
That's actually
more interesting.

780
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,160
I'm 42 now, right? I don't have
to jerk off as much.

781
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,000
Thank Christ my libido
has gradually begun to die,

782
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,080
but at the time I'm 25,

783
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,600
and when you're 25 you have to
jerk off all the time, right?

784
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,640
If you don't,
there could be an event,

785
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,360
like, you must jerk off.

786
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,600
And so I would wait.
It was really hard.

787
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,760
So I would wait...
I'd wait, like, ten days.

788
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,120
None of you did that,

789
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,040
You probably didn't even know
it was possible, and so...

790
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,400
I mean, literally I would wait
until I burped

791
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,600
and then tasted semen
in the back of my throat.

792
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,160
I'd be like, "I gotta jerk off,
I gotta jerk off."

793
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,480
And so I would go
into the bathroom at rehab,

794
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,560
and I would sit down
on the floor,

795
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,080
with my back towards the door,

796
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,680
cos there's no locks
on the door in rehab.

797
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,640
So if somebody opened the door,
it would hit me,

798
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,880
and I could say, "Just
jerking off, not shooting up."

799
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,040
And they'd be like,
"Carry on, my man."

800
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,600
And then, using my teeth
and my fingertips,

801
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,160
I would take off the brace

802
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,160
of whatever arm had
least recently been operated on

803
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,880
and then using my fingertips
so delicately

804
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,040
so that I didn't hurt my arm
with my penis, I would jerk off,

805
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,320
just ever so gently,
ever so gently.

806
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,800
Like the way that you would
jerk off a baby if you had to.

807
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,600
Hey...

808
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,280
Hey, don't jerk off a baby, OK?
Don't even think about it.

809
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah, don't jerk off at all,
actually.

810
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,960
Honestly, I can't wait
for my libido to die.

811
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,960
I know I said that thing about
fucking people in nursing homes,

812
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,800
but that's something I wanna do
now. When I'm actually that age!

813
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,560
I get angry when I see
commercials for Viagra,

814
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,600
and it's, like, a couple
in their eighties out on a canoe

815
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,600
and then the guy
crushes up the blue pill

816
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,160
and then snorts it
off his girlfriend's tits

817
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,960
and then they paddle into shore
to go fuck. Ugh!

818
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,440
If I could figure out
where my libido is in my head,

819
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,800
I'd stick a fucking pool cue
in my eye and just route it out

820
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,880
so that I could get some
fucking work done.

821
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,520
So sex dolls, sex robots,
sex robot dolls,

822
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,200
they're getting good, OK?

823
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,640
And whenever they show
on the news,

824
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,360
at the end of the hard news when
they show a human interest story

825
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,640
and they go to visit some guy

826
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,560
on the 37th floor
of a skyscraper in Tokyo,

827
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,400
and he's like "Yeah, I haven't
left my apartment in 3 years,

828
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,040
"I've just been fucking my robot
Betsy, having a good time."

829
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:59,080
I always judge that guy,
I'm like, "I don't fuck a robot,

830
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,200
"I fuck a human woman,

831
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,080
"semi-annually."

832
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,840
But here's the thing,

833
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
whenever new technology
comes out,

834
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,200
I always hate it,

835
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,640
just reflexively,
I don't know why.

836
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,360
Like when the iPad came out,
I was like, "Gimme a break."

837
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,960
It was like halfway between
a desktop and a phone,

838
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,280
both of which I already own
and can do all the same shit.

839
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,120
It's like the Goldilocks one
in the middle,

840
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,640
so I don't sprain my fingers

841
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
if I try to go too fast
from a desktop to a phone,

842
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,040
it's ridiculous.

843
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,800
Anyway, flash forward
a few years,

844
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,560
I now own three iPads, OK?

845
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,000
And what that means is,

846
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:36,520
I'm definitely gonna fuck
a sex robot, OK?

847
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,640
In the not distant future,
I'm fucking a sex robot,

848
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,440
and so are you, OK?

849
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,800
And so are some of your moms.
All right?

850
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,880
Not all of your moms,

851
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,760
but the ones who can do,
like, emojis now,

852
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,520
they're fucking robots.

853
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,800
You're gonna be...

854
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,760
You're gonna be over at their
house for a roast on Sunday,

855
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,880
and she's gonna be like,
"Sweetheart, can you help me

856
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,800
"download the George Clooney
tongue swirling plug-in?"

857
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,960
And then you do

858
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,920
and then you have to help
lower her down onto it

859
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,520
cos she has a bad ankle,
and then she's like, "Whoa...

860
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,760
"Close the door, sweetheart.

861
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,040
"Check on the potatoes,
check on the potatoes."

862
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,480
Isn't that nice? I honestly...

863
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,160
If you'd asked me in the past,
you would have been like,

864
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,800
"What sex robot
are you gonna get?"

865
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,040
I'd be like,
"Well, the Serena Williams one."

866
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,320
But now that I think
about the Clooney

867
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,600
with that stubble all up
in your mom's ass, I want that.

868
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,360
So I think what I'm gonna do,

869
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
I'm gonna put
a George Clooney head

870
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,280
on a Serena Williams body,

871
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,800
and I am gonna fuck that thing

872
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,400
until I have a heart attack
at 51 and die.

873
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,520
My son finally comes in
with the hatchet to do the job

874
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,320
and he finds my corpse,
he's like, "Oh, look at that!"

875
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,960
He just throws one in
for good measure.

876
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,120
He's a good boy.

877
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,840
So...

878
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,160
Another thing I love about
the UK is, you guys have trains.

879
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,480
In America there's, like,
one train from like Boston to...

880
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Trains are communist.

881
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,360
You can ride a train,
you can make a friend -

882
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,640
next week, revolution.

883
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,080
So no trains in America,

884
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,160
there's just people in solo cars
with AR15s, that's it.

885
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,840
But here you got trains and
I didn't know how to use them.

886
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,120
I remember the first time

887
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,880
we were gonna go
on a school vacation

888
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,320
after we'd lived here
not that long.

889
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,120
We were gonna go to Cornwall.

890
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,400
You go to Cornwall? Huh?
Yeah, fucking toilet, right?

891
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,080
No it's the nicest place
I've ever been. Anyway...

892
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:29,280
We wanted to go to Cornwall,

893
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,280
so I'm in charge
of arranging travel.

894
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,120
So, basically,
I didn't know how to get...

895
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,920
I go on the website
and I see a picture of a train

896
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,960
and I’m like,
"Train! OK, let's go."

897
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,560
Then we get to the station
at, like, 4pm on a Friday

898
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,440
before a big school vacation,

899
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,640
and it's just fucking packed
with people,

900
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,320
and my wife's like, "OK, you
got us specific seats, right?"

901
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,080
I'm like,
"Huh, I didn't know you could."

902
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,440
She's like, "Fuck you!"

903
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
And so...

904
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,640
the doors to the train open
and steam comes out,

905
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
there's already
so many people in it,

906
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,520
it's like a meat puzzle,

907
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,160
we're stuffing our children in
and people are looking at me.

908
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,600
I'm like, "I'm sorry."

909
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,480
And then the train
took off to Cornwall,

910
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,160
travelling for a little while,
not that long, though,

911
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,840
and then the train just stopped
in Slough,

912
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,920
which isn't in Cornwall.

913
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,160
In fact, it didn't even stop
at the Slough station,

914
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,480
it stopped in a fucking field
in the middle of nowhere,

915
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,120
and we're like,
"What is going on?"

916
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,040
And after a little while,
the conductor got in

917
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,000
and he goes, "Very sorry to say,

918
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,320
"but we have struck a person
who wandered onto the tracks

919
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,160
"and there's been a fatality."

920
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,640
And so everybody's, like,
super upset.

921
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,880
I mean, we're in a thing
that killed a person.

922
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,640
So it's like a giant bummer,

923
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,200
but then 90 seconds passed,
and my kids went feral.

924
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,440
One of them
ripped a wig off an old lady.

925
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,800
So I start to hate the dead guy.

926
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm like, "I hope the train
fucking ran you over

927
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
"and then backed up
and ran you over again,

928
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,040
"you fucking asshole.

929
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,880
"I live in Slough now
with my shitty family

930
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,680
"because you were sad

931
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,760
"and had to jump in front
of a train, you fucking loser."

932
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,480
Look, hey, mental health
is a very serious thing,

933
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,080
and that isn't funny, OK?

934
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,080
But what is funny is,
I'm kidding, he was pushed,

935
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
it was a murder,
so it's OK to laugh.

936
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,600
It's OK.

937
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,000
It was just two friends
goofing around, whatever.

938
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,920
So we got to Cornwall,
all right,

939
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,760
it was wonderful, we were having
a great time staying on a farm,

940
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,760
and one night we wanted
to go on a date, my wife and I.

941
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,360
So we took the kids and
we stuffed them in a pig kennel,

942
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,360
and we called up,
we called a taxi,

943
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,640
and the taxi's taking us
out to dinner somewhere,

944
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,800
and we're talking to the driver
and he goes,

945
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,680
"Hey, where do you guys live?"
And we were like, "Oh, London."

946
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,160
And he goes "Ah, London, yeah,
not really England, but hmm..."

947
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,840
And I was like,
"What does that mean?"

948
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,640
And he goes,
"Oh, I'm a bigot."

949
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm paraphrasing,

950
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,600
but he basically did, like,
a full minstrel show

951
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,960
with fucking props,

952
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,160
he did every level of melanin,
it was fucking disgusting.

953
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,040
And so I'm like, "Ugh!"
I hated him.

954
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,480
I hate bigots,
I really fucking do.

955
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,600
I gotta say, it's easy enough
for me to point at you, sir,

956
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,760
and be like, "Bigot!"
Look at you.

957
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,360
But for me to stand up here

958
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,000
and admit that I have prejudice
in my heart is kind of heroic.

959
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
Look, let me tell you,
I'm not...

960
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,880
Look, at I don't want
to have prejudice, but I do,

961
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,160
I'm a person
and I wanna get rid...

962
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,160
let me tell you a story
about a prejudice that I have

963
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,120
that is absolutely fucking wrong

964
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,840
and that I deeply feel
in my bones.

965
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,480
I was walking in my
neighbourhood not too long ago,

966
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,400
and I saw a guy
washing his car, OK?

967
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,440
He's, it's a teal
Volkswagen Beetle

968
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,280
and he's washing the car

969
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,400
and he's got
short denim shorts on,

970
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,960
it is not hot out.
He does not have a shirt on,

971
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,040
and he's got really nice
abdominal muscles,

972
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,080
and he's washing the car
and kinda dancing.

973
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,240
He's got Madonna
on the car stereo.

974
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,000
Not like a big hit,
not like "Like a Prayer",

975
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,920
but, like, deep disco Madonna.

976
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,480
So he's dancing, singing,
washing his car, looking great.

977
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,400
So I see this guy
and I think to myself,

978
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,080
"I've got you figured out, sir."

979
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,840
But then a woman came out of
the house he was in front of

980
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,640
and said, "Hey sweetheart,"
and kissed him

981
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,960
in the French manner,
tongues akimbo,

982
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,280
and I was like,
"Whoa, that does not fit

983
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,680
"with the story
I was telling myself about you!"

984
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,520
And it made me realise,

985
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,120
I would fight in a war
for the right of gay guys

986
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,200
to fuck each other
in front of my family,

987
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,440
but then I would redeploy
to another front

988
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,280
to fight against straight guys'
rights to fucking prance around

989
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,440
listening to that shit
dressed that way.

990
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,640
What the fuck is that?

991
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,240
But I'm wrong!
What the fuck do I...

992
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,520
Just cos I dress like
a gas station attendant,

993
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,120
why can't he have
a little flair and be happy?

994
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,960
Why the fuck do I care?
But I do.

995
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,520
I feel, like,
when a straight guy turns 30,

996
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,360
he should be issued a beige
jumpsuit from the government

997
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,560
so he doesn't try to infect me
with his intensive style.

998
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,960
I don't wanna see that shit.

999
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,680
But I do,
I have to jettison that belief,

1000
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,240
I do, because I don't want
my grandkids to be like,

1001
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,400
"Well, you know, we don't
really talk about grandpa Rob

1002
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,720
"because he was
an ardent campaigner

1003
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:10,360
"against straight fashion
and music appreciation rights."

1004
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
I mean, look,

1005
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,440
I know there are some prejudices
that make sense,

1006
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,120
like if you know really wealthy
Russian people in London,

1007
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,720
that's cos they killed people
in Russia

1008
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,160
and took their money
and came here.

1009
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,040
But that's just...

1010
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,440
It's funny, when you tell
that joke outside of London,

1011
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,000
people are like, "I can't
believe he's saying that!

1012
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,600
"It's terrible. How dare he?"

1013
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,560
And then in London,
people are like...

1014
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,320
And then rich Russian people
in London are like,

1015
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,440
"Oh, you got me!"

1016
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,720
It was nice of you
to get upset on their behalf,

1017
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,160
but it's OK,
they have it covered.

1018
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,120
So our one-year-old
was born in our house,

1019
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,000
one year ago.

1020
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,320
And we did it at home and...

1021
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:59,600
We're not hippies,

1022
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,440
but on your fourth kid you're
a hippy about birth anyway.

1023
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,480
plus my wife was like, "I don't
wanna go to the hospital again,

1024
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,760
"I can just do it right here,
it won't be a problem."

1025
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,640
And so we were doing
a home water birth,

1026
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,680
and so, you know, you send away
for a birthing pool

1027
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,240
that they mail to you

1028
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,320
and it's been used before,
which is cool.

1029
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,640
They wash it, I think,

1030
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,520
but it's got stamps on it
that say who's been born it.

1031
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,040
You have to do a test inflate
a couple of weeks before D-day

1032
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,840
so that you don't fuck it up
when it comes.

1033
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,720
So I inflated the thing,
got it ready,

1034
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,480
and my dad happened
to be visiting at the time,

1035
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,840
and I actually made him stand
in the far end of the kitchen,

1036
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,480
and I got down into the tub
and I took my clothes off

1037
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,480
and I made him film me
going like...

1038
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,560
I showed it to my wife,

1039
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,280
and she was like,
"Delete that right now.

1040
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,080
"and then go to your friends'
houses who you've sent it to

1041
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,160
"and delete it from their phones
as well." And...

1042
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,600
So our older boys knew that
we wanted to do the home birth,

1043
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:57,960
and so they actually asked

1044
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,760
if they could be present for the
birth, which I thought was cool.

1045
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:03,600
And I said to them, "Yeah, well,

1046
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,480
"why don't I show you
some videos of home births,

1047
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,560
"and then you can decide
if you're into that

1048
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,560
"and if you wanna see it really
with your own two eyes."

1049
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,080
And they're like, "Great!"

1050
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,120
And so I fired up
the old YouTube,

1051
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,960
and here's the thing,

1052
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,480
lots of people have babies,
billions in fact,

1053
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,640
there's a big group of people
who have babies, OK?

1054
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,160
Smaller
than that group of people

1055
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,880
is the ones who do it at home,
that's a smaller group.

1056
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,160
Smaller than that
is the people who film it.

1057
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,560
Smaller than that are the people
who then edit the video,

1058
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,360
score it to Enya or Kate Bush

1059
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,200
and then put it online
for you to watch.

1060
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,440
That's a pretty tiny
group of people, OK?

1061
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,720
Then even without that group,
the women are all amazing.

1062
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,680
There's no right or wrong way
to have a baby,

1063
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,920
they're all fucking brilliant.

1064
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,760
I couldn't do it,
so nothing wrong with them.

1065
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,600
But some of the men
in these videos fucking suck.

1066
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,640
I remember we were watching
one of the videos,

1067
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:00,000
and it opens the video with
some nice bells and whistles

1068
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,880
and fucking panflutes and stuff.

1069
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,160
And then,
the first thing you see is a man

1070
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,080
and he's a white guy
with dreadlocks,

1071
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,760
and he's got sunglasses in them.
It's not... he's not outdoors.

1072
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:12,840
And he's in a robe,

1073
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,840
not like a dressing gown
or a bathrobe,

1074
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,040
just a ceremonial robe,

1075
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,360
and so already my kids are like,
"Daddy, what's the deal?"

1076
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,840
I'm like, "I don't know."

1077
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,360
And then it pans out,

1078
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,760
and you see there happens to be
a woman there.

1079
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,640
And so he walks over to the tub,

1080
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,080
and then he steps up
and he gets in the tub,

1081
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,520
and my boys are already up,

1082
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,480
they're like,
"Daddy, make him get out.

1083
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,640
"It's not for him. That isn't...
Why, Daddy?"

1084
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,920
I'm like, "I don't know."

1085
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,520
And then the guy kneels
down opposite his partner,

1086
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,600
and he puts his forehead
against hers,

1087
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,320
and he goes... are you ready?
"We can do this."

1088
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,080
And my youngest one goes,
"Who the fuck is 'we'?

1089
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,840
"He's not doing anything,
Daddy."

1090
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,120
They hated the guy so much

1091
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,080
that by the time the baby was,
like, bleugh,

1092
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,000
they were like. "That's cool,
but fuck that guy!"

1093
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,520
So they totally were there
when my wife had the baby,

1094
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,640
and they were amazing.

1095
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,520
Our eight-year-old
actually cut the cord.

1096
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,120
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.

1097
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,800
Had I not cut the first three,
I wouldn't have let him cut it,

1098
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,920
but, I mean, I've cut
a lot of cords in my day.

1099
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,240
Yeah, I cut a cord
on the way here in fact.

1100
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,040
I'll cut your cord
after the show

1101
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,360
if you don't
fucking sort yourself out.

1102
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,480
So that baby just turned one.

1103
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,120
My wife stopped breastfeeding
him a little while ago,

1104
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,560
and breastfeeding,
my God, it's amazing.

1105
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,560
But it's difficult.
It is. It's very challenging...

1106
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,240
to be around a woman
who's breastfeeding

1107
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,520
cos their hormonal.
I'm not interested in that.

1108
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,320
And so I was thinking,
I have an idea for an invention,

1109
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,760
which... don't try to steal it,

1110
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,400
cos I've already begun
the patent process.

1111
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,720
But basically what it is,

1112
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,000
is, it is a strip that you would
put on a breastfeeding woman,

1113
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,680
or really any woman's forehead,

1114
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,800
and it would have several
tasteful light bulbs in it, OK?

1115
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,360
And depending
on how many are lit up,

1116
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:59,360
it lets you know how nice you
have to be to that woman, OK?

1117
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,400
So like if just one is lit up,

1118
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,200
you can be like,
"Yeah, here you go, bro."

1119
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,520
And that's no big deal,
but if all five are lit up,

1120
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:08,040
then you know you have to crawl
in on your fingers and toes

1121
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,560
and prostrate yourself
with a variety of snacks

1122
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,120
and fucking say incantations
and stuff.

1123
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,080
So anyway,
it was a good idea, right?

1124
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,720
I told a friend of mine
about it, and he was like,

1125
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,720
"What if you were just nice
to her all the time?"

1126
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,280
I was like, "Yeah, I think

1127
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:24,640
"that's the crazier
than the light strips, my man."

1128
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,360
All the time?

1129
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,360
What a silly guy.

1130
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,760
So listen, I hope
you can't tell by looking at me,

1131
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,640
but I own a bearded dragon, OK?

1132
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,800
I didn't want one.

1133
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,800
I feel like that's one of those
pets like a fucking cockatiel

1134
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,400
that you use to like express
your wacky personality.

1135
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,800
I feel like a bearded dragon
should belong to, like,

1136
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,080
a Swiss electronic music DJ

1137
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,240
who's like,
"After I drop all my beats,

1138
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,160
"I go home and play
with my bearded dragon." Yuck.

1139
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,120
Anyway, I didn't want one,

1140
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,960
and so my kids found out
that those existed,

1141
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:04,560
and they said, "Daddy,
can we get a bearded dragon?"

1142
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:06,600
And I was like,
"No, under no circumstances."

1143
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,000
Then, I don't know, I was out
for the weekend gambling,

1144
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,880
and I came home and my wife had
bought them a bearded dragon.

1145
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,480
And I was like,
"Why did you do that?"

1146
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,960
And she's like,
"Let me tell you about

1147
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,760
"what buying
the bearded dragon was like."

1148
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,960
And she's like, "OK..."

1149
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:22,680
The guy, was like, "All right,

1150
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,520
"you gotta keep it hot
all the time, OK?

1151
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,520
"Cos they're coldblooded.
If it gets cold, it'll die, OK?

1152
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,520
"So you need three
different types of heat lamp,

1153
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,080
"you need a heat pad
that goes under its wood chips.

1154
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,240
"You keep it hot or it dies."

1155
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,560
OK, do you guys
happen to know...

1156
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,840
Does anybody know
what bearded dragons eat?

1157
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,680
Locusts from the bible, OK?

1158
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,240
I thought that
we had eradicated those.

1159
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:46,240
And by the way,
you know, locusts,

1160
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,720
they're not even
the first plague from the bible.

1161
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,640
The first one's, like,
"Stubbed my toe."

1162
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,840
But then they're
the fucking ninth plague,

1163
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,720
the one right before the angel
of death kills your first born.

1164
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,440
So literally God was like,

1165
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,000
"What's almost as bad as
having the devil kill your baby?

1166
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,680
"Oh, a locust." And so...

1167
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,640
So anyway, you gotta feed it
locusts all the time, OK?

1168
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,840
If you're not feeding it
a locust, ask yourself,

1169
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,240
"Why am I not
feeding it a locust?" OK?

1170
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,040
You should be using one locust

1171
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,400
to push another locust
into its maw.

1172
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,240
Like, you need to be
covered in sheets of sweat

1173
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:22,480
as you stick locusts
into every hole, or it will die.

1174
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,480
So I'm like, "Jesus Christ!"

1175
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,200
So I tell the kids,
"Are you up for this?"

1176
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,760
And they're like,
"Yeah, Daddy, we can do it."

1177
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,040
And they did, they, honestly,

1178
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,040
they were great
for about 23 hours,

1179
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,120
and then they forgot
that they had a bearded dragon

1180
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:35,360
and it fell to me
to take care of her.

1181
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,600
And I’m not ashamed to admit
that I fell in love with her

1182
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,840
very thoroughly
and very quickly.

1183
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,480
And her name is Jackie.

1184
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,760
And... I mean, we had...

1185
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,560
God, did we have
a good thing and...

1186
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Seriously, I mean it's...
Jackie. Anyway...

1187
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,040
We'd had her for a while,

1188
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,880
and then one day the boys left
the door to her vivarium open,

1189
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,560
and they also left the back door
to the house open.

1190
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,600
And so we all
came home one day,

1191
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,240
and Jackie
was nowhere to be found.

1192
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,240
And we're all very upset.

1193
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,960
And so we're tearing
the house apart.

1194
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,440
I'm like cutting
into fucking cushions

1195
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,000
like I'm looking for cocaine.

1196
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,400
We were turning the house
upside down to find her,

1197
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,680
but we cannot find her.

1198
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,000
And so I'm very, very upset,

1199
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,240
spending like a lot of time
in the foetal position.

1200
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:27,240
And after a few days,
the boys came to me

1201
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,800
and they were like,
"Daddy, do you think she's OK?"

1202
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:31,960
And I said, "No.

1203
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,200
"No, I think what happened is,

1204
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,920
"when she first saw
that the door was open,

1205
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,040
"she probably got excited.

1206
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:39,560
"She probably leapt out in your
room and played with some Lego

1207
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,480
"and your little football cards
and stuff. It's nice.

1208
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,800
"And then maybe
she heard, like, a 'cuckoo'

1209
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,480
"and was like, 'Oh, what's that?
Is that a bird?'

1210
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,800
"and then went and looked -

1211
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,400
"'Oh, my God,
the door to the world's open.'

1212
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,600
"And then went out there,
you know?

1213
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,600
"That's probably
when things started to go south.

1214
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,880
"I'm gonna guess
at that point, you know,

1215
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,560
"she's getting colder quickly,

1216
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,080
"so confusion
begins to set in, OK?

1217
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,680
"Not long after that,

1218
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,840
"ice crystals begin to form
in her blood,

1219
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,160
"cutting her apart
from the inside,

1220
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,880
"and then soon after that,

1221
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,640
"I'm gonna guess
that she probably died

1222
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,200
"in great deal of pain
and went to hell

1223
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,720
"because of a series of choices
that you made."

1224
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:20,320
And they were like, "OK, cool,"
and they went to play football.

1225
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,000
I mean, I was losing it,

1226
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:25,360
I was inconsolable,
I didn't know what to do.

1227
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,720
It was terrible.

1228
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,960
And then the hands on the clock
spun round and round,

1229
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,080
and the pages on the calendar
and all this,

1230
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,040
and so time passes,
and then a fucking month passes,

1231
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,240
and so I'm starting to be able
to participate in life again.

1232
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:40,480
I'm experimenting
with trusting people again,

1233
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,600
and stuff like that.

1234
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,760
And then my doorbell rings,

1235
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,040
and it's my neighbour
who I fucking hate,

1236
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,400
and I hate him cos he's been
doing construction for 4 years.

1237
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,080
And it's not like if you have
a big construction place

1238
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,960
near where you work
and it's just a wash of noise,

1239
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,280
you kind of get used to it.

1240
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,400
This guy's been doing fucking
staccato atonal John Cage,

1241
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,320
like it's...
you can't figure it out.

1242
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,680
So it'll be, like, brrr...

1243
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,760
Bang!
And you're like, "Jesus!"

1244
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,720
My nerves are destroyed
from this and I can't stand it.

1245
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,120
Anyway, rings the doorbell,
I open, and he's like, "Hello."

1246
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,720
And I’m like, "Yeah?"
And he goes,

1247
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,080
"You didn't by any chance
have a package for me?"

1248
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,720
Cos in this fucking
Godforsaken country,

1249
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,480
if you get a package
and you're not home,

1250
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,440
they give it to your neighbour,
and they give you a little note,

1251
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,240
saying, "Guess what,
you get to make a new friend."

1252
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,600
And so you get to know
this person

1253
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,480
that you've been avoiding
studiously for years.

1254
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,480
And so, anyway...

1255
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,040
So, I was like,
"Yeah, here's your package."

1256
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,360
And he goes,
"Oh, and by the way,

1257
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,040
"you're not missing a lizard
by any chance, are you?"

1258
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,160
And I was like...

1259
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,240
"Oh, do you have
her little body?"

1260
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,960
And he's like, "No, she's fine,
she's in my back garden."

1261
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,760
And so I pushed him
to the wall and ran out

1262
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,840
and then ran through his house
and into the back garden,

1263
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,360
and Jackie was like,
"What's up, motherfucker?"

1264
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,400
And it's freezing out,
there's no locusts anywhere,

1265
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:51,960
and she's like, "Ooh, sorry."

1266
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,480
And I was like,
"Oh, I can't stay mad at you."

1267
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,040
And I unbuttoned my shirt and
pressed her against my breast

1268
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,640
to feel my paternal heartbeat,

1269
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,040
and I’m crying and it's washing
the dust off of her.

1270
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,280
I go into the house,

1271
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:06,920
and I get some blueberries
out of the fridge

1272
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,600
and I just chew them up,
and then I...

1273
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,880
cunnaling them
into her cute little mouth.

1274
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Mm, my sweet Jackie girl,
I love you.

1275
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,320
I do, I love her.

1276
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:20,520
Honestly, I'm having a great
time with you guys tonight,

1277
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,200
but I seriously
can't wait to go home

1278
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,360
and just put her
on my heaving chest

1279
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:27,040
and sing her to sleep.
I love her.

1280
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,880
Jackie.

1281
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,960
Jackie.

1282
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,320
So my big boys recently
found out about homosexuality,

1283
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,520
and they're very excited.

1284
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,800
They came up to me a while ago,
and they go, "Daddy..."

1285
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,760
I'm sorry they go, "Daddy"
cos they have English accents,

1286
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,240
which makes me love them
so much more.

1287
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,160
In fact,
their accents are kinda weird

1288
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,880
cos they started them in America
and now they're here,

1289
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,600
plus their nursery school
teachers had cockney accents,

1290
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,600
so some of the words
they say are bonkers,

1291
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,160
particularly the word "water".

1292
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,040
Like I say "water",
whatever that is.

1293
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,640
You guys say "water",

1294
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,960
and then, you know,
cockneys, like, "water".

1295
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,960
And so,
the three of them together,

1296
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,160
the way they say "water",

1297
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:10,720
I can't even do it,
it's like a whale being stabbed,

1298
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,760
it's insane. And so...

1299
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,200
I FaceTimed my mom

1300
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,320
and I was like,
"Mom, you've gotta hear this."

1301
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,360
And so
I said to the younger one,

1302
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:23,520
"Tell Grammy what liquid
comes out of the tap."

1303
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,520
And he looked at her
and he goes, "Blood."

1304
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,960
Anyway, so they corner me,
and they're like, "Daddy?"

1305
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,360
And I’m like, "Yeah?"
And they go...

1306
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,920
"Is it true that we don't
have to marry women?"

1307
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,440
And I was like, "Yeah."

1308
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,200
And they were like, "Cool."

1309
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,240
And then went away
and had a little conference,

1310
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,400
and they came back,
and they go, "Daddy...

1311
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:58,080
"Could we marry men?"

1312
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:01,480
And I'm like,
"Yeah, yeah, if you want."

1313
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,400
And they were like, "Ooh..."

1314
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,960
And they went away,
and they came back,

1315
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,120
and they were like...
They go, "Daddy..."

1316
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,120
OK, we have these neighbours
that they love to play with,

1317
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,320
these twin boys
who are named Charlie and Ethan,

1318
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,880
and they go, "Daddy could we
marry Charlie and Ethan?"

1319
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,240
And I was like, "OK,
now that's more complicated.

1320
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:29,640
"I mean, OK...
if all four of your hearts

1321
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:34,160
"wandered down
life's winding road

1322
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,720
"and then, like,
a couple decades from now

1323
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,680
"you still wanted
to get married,

1324
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,280
"and by the way is...

1325
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,600
"one of you marrying the other
one, and is it two marriage...

1326
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,440
"or is it like a quad lambo,
like what it...

1327
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:47,880
"Anyway, the answer is yes.
Yeah, you could."

1328
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,080
And they were like, "Ah!"

1329
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,800
They were so happy,
like, they started to glow.

1330
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,840
And then they go off
for a final conference,

1331
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,480
and they come back,
and they go, "Daddy,

1332
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,320
"could the four of us wrestle
before bed every night?"

1333
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,760
I was like, "That's kind of
the main draw."

1334
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,440
They just exploded
into a beautiful rainbow mist.

1335
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,520
How great is that wedding
gonna be, I can't wait.

1336
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,400
So, are there any
Bill Cosby fans in the house?

1337
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,040
Who likes the Cos, huh?

1338
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,680
If you're not familiar
with Bill Cosby,

1339
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,000
he's a prolific American rapist.

1340
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,560
When I was kid,
we knew him as a comedian.

1341
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,880
We didn't know yet
that he was a renaissance man

1342
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,400
with the whole bag of skills.

1343
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,800
And... so I was crazy about him,
he was my hero when I was...

1344
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,080
He was, like, everybody
in America's hero,

1345
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,480
and... so,
I'd never seen him live, though.

1346
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:46,120
So about ten years ago,
he was coming to LA,

1347
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:48,880
and again, this is before we
knew about his other projects,

1348
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:51,160
and I’m excited,
I wanted to go see him.

1349
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,320
So I get tickets to go see him.

1350
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,320
And at this time,
I'm doing comedy myself,

1351
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,600
nobody cares, no one attends,
but I'm doing it,

1352
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,680
and so I called my agent
at the time,

1353
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,280
and I was like,
"I'm going to see Bill Cosby."

1354
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,240
and he was like, "Oh, yeah,
cool, let me call you back."

1355
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,000
And he called me back a little
while later and he goes,

1356
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,120
"So you know we represent
Bill Cosby as well,

1357
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,640
"and so I told his agent
that you're coming,

1358
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,960
"and he'd like to meet you."

1359
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,400
And I was like,
"Bill Cosby wants to meet me?"

1360
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,400
And he was like, "No, he
doesn't wanna fucking meet you,

1361
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,640
"He doesn't know who you are.

1362
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,640
"But he likes to blather at
young up-and-coming comedians

1363
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,280
"and just hear himself
talk about comedy.

1364
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,680
"Are you willing to do that?"
And I was like, "Yes, I am."

1365
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,840
And so my wife and I
were gonna go see Bill Cosby.

1366
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,120
And this is right after
the birth of our first child.

1367
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,560
So we're so excited. I mean,
we'd be excited normally,

1368
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,160
but it's also our first date
after we've become parents,

1369
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,480
and so we're very excited.

1370
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,320
And so we're all dressed up,
and we go,

1371
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,560
and we're ushered backstage,

1372
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,760
and his tour manager
brings us in, and Bill sees us,

1373
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:43,760
and as soon as he sees my wife,

1374
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:46,880
he just pushes me aside,
zeros in on her,

1375
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,360
and he goes,
"Are you breastfeeding?"

1376
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,400
And she goes, "Yeah."

1377
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,360
And he goes, "I could smell it."

1378
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,680
And he goes,
"It gets into the clothes.

1379
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,040
"Mm, I love it."

1380
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,360
And we're like,
"Oh, God," you know.

1381
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,840
I mean, fucking sickened.

1382
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,920
And afterwards,
my wife and I were talking,

1383
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,800
and we literally were like,
"Oh, my God, did we just see

1384
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,440
"Bill Cosby do the first
creepy thing that he ever did?"

1385
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,760
Like, we thought we won
some horrible lottery, you know?

1386
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,280
And so it's very strange.

1387
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
And then after about 10 minutes,
his manager was like,

1388
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,960
"Bill, you've gotta do your show
now," and he was like, "OK."

1389
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,920
And so finally he acknowledges
me for the first time,

1390
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,120
and he points at my wife's tits
and he goes,

1391
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,520
"Don't get used to those,

1392
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,760
"cos once she's done
breastfeeding,

1393
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,320
"they're gonna brr...
and disappear."

1394
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,880
Anyway, joke's on Bill Cosby

1395
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,120
because my wife's tits
are still banging,

1396
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,360
and he's gonna die in prison.

1397
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,560
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1398
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,960
Good night.
