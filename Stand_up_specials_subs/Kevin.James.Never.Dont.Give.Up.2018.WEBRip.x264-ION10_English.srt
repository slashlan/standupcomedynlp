New York!

17
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,319
I gotta be honest,
I was not expecting that.

18
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,871
I was expecting a little more.
I just felt...

19
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,166
I felt like you had a little
in the gas tank and kinda....

20
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,919
Get that picture. Get it.
I wasn't ready, hold on.

21
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,463
Come on. I'm always in bad pictures.

22
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,715
I want to take a good one,
like I'm doing something.

23
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,426
There you go. You got it? All right, good.

24
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,929
I just took a picture with a group
of ladies backstage.

25
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,723
Very nice, older ladies, very sweet.

26
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,892
I don't mind taking pictures.

27
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,062
I just wish the person they elect
to take the picture... had seen a cell phone camera once before.

28
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,528
I get locked into say cheese position...

29
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,532
"She doesn't know what she's doing,
does she?"

30
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,242
She's just standing there. "I...

31
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,039
I don't... I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't...

32
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,751
I see me. I'm taking pictures of me.

33
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,671
No... Now I got it. Sorry.

34
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,465
Nope. I'm in Google Maps,
hold on a second."

35
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,052
You're just stuck there. [laughing]

36
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:20,098
"It's fine. It's fine.
Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

37
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,892
It's all right. It happens all the time.
It's all good.

38
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,728
Yeah, your lower back is sweaty.
Yeah. Yeah.

39
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,108
Somebody had a Caesar salad earlier, huh?"

40
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,823
I was in Atlanta at the airport waiting
for my bag,

41
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,992
and this woman asked to take a picture,

42
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,162
and I was like, "Sure, no problem,"
and she takes out her iPhone,

43
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,665
and she just holds it on me,
and I'm just standing there.

44
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,422
She doesn't say anything.
I'm just standing there.

45
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,799
Finally, I just started smiling on my own.

46
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,137
Still nothing.

47
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,182
Then I started turning into it
to let her know I was ready, like...

48
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,978
"There you go. This is it.

49
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,938
Snap it!"

50
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,193
Finally, I was like, "Did you get it?"

51
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,070
She goes like this, she goes,
"Nope. I'm getting it."

52
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,114
"I'm getting it?"

53
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,367
She's video recording me
from a foot away.

54
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,412
Like I'm a panda at the zoo.

55
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,626
And then she was like,
"Could you do something?"

56
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,464
"Could I? Yeah, yeah. How about
I sweep your legs out from under you,

57
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,176
watch your hip bounce off the mosaic tile?
How about that?

58
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,347
Let's see if we can keep filming with
a shattered hip. How does that feel?"

59
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,061
When do you watch that video?
When are you ever gonna watch that video?

60
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,605
When does it come up?
When are you like, "Honey, know what?

61
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:51,898
Let's do it tonight.

62
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,361
Yes, let's crack open a bottle of wine.
We'll invite the gang over

63
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:00,323
and watch a random clip of someone
who doesn't know they're being filmed.

64
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:05,370
Remember how much fun we had last week
watching Coolio at the dry cleaners?

65
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,626
Tonight we got Kevin James
looking very confused at baggage claim.

66
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,627
Check it out."

67
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,968
"Did you get it? Are you good?
Did you get it?

68
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,595
You good? Did you get it?"

69
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,105
God forbid somebody walks in late,
"I gotta rewind it, hold on a second."

70
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:42,240
This one older guy wanted
to take a picture. He had a walker.

71
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,034
First off, is there going
to come a time in my life

72
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,955
where I see a walker
without the tennis balls on the bottom?

73
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,875
Honestly,
all the technology we have nowadays.

74
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,380
Could we please slow down production
on the next iPhone...

75
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,467
and just dedicate a couple guys
from Apple...

76
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:07,015
to work on the tennis ball
on the walker problem

77
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,100
we have running rampant in this country?

78
00:05:13,604 --> 00:05:16,899
It's gonna take 'em what, seven minutes?
They'll bang out a solution.

79
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,656
This guy had an active walker, too.
He had a handbrake on the walker.

80
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,288
How fast are you walking?

81
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,419
I thought walking was the problem.
That's why you got a walker.

82
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,670
You got a walker.

83
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:42,050
Now you have a handbrake on the walker
in case things get out of control.

84
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,219
'Cause you never know when
you're walking along a highway,

85
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,056
someone sneaks up behind you,
bumps the horn, you get all crazy legs...

86
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,850
and Riverdance off into the woods.

87
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,023
You guys are fun. You guys are good.

88
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,068
That's why I'm not doing an encore.
Gonna give you the whole show up front.

89
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,866
I don't like encores, they're insincere.
I don't like 'em. They're fake. You know?

90
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,869
I went and saw Aerosmith in concert
about three, four years ago.

91
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,497
And they were great, by the way.
They were fantastic,

92
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,208
but they didn't play their best song.
They didn't play "Dream On."

93
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,252
And then they walked off stage,

94
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:22,757
and the whole audience had to stand
on their feet clapping for 15 minutes

95
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,679
before Aerosmith came back out
and finished their job.

96
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,725
You know you're gonna play "Dream On."

97
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,520
The whole arena knows
you're playing "Dream On."

98
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,524
"Let's cut the dance, Steven Tyler.
I got a babysitter needs me home by 11.

99
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,525
Can we--

100
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,444
You owe me 'Dream On.' You owe it to me."

101
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,656
Entertainment's the only profession
that does it.

102
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,826
You don't see your accountant, like,
"Well, here are most of your taxes.

103
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,997
Good night!"

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,876
"You didn't finish!"

105
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,380
"Let's see how loud you can get it
out there, maybe I'll come back.

106
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,384
Just not feeling it right now.
I am not feeling it."

107
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,055
They gotta stand out there
with their cell phones,

108
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,058
"Come on, Irv, close with the refund!

109
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,020
You forgot the refund, Irv!"

110
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:25,570
I had to get my eyesight checked,
so I went to Pearle Vision Center,

111
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:29,615
and as I'm walking in the store,
in the front window of the store, they have a massive poster of this
little boy opening a birthday present

112
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,580
and it's a pair of eyeglasses.

113
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,796
And he couldn't have been happier.
He was--

114
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,383
He had, like, a little tear cracking
on the side, just rolling down his face.

115
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,594
What kind of sick parent...

116
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,724
gives their child eyeglasses as a gift?

117
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,145
"Well, you know, Leonard,
you were very good this year.

118
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,732
You pulled in an A-minus average.
You were very good to your sister.

119
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,943
You did everything your father
and I asked of you, so...

120
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,445
this year...

121
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,827
we're gonna give you the gift of sight!

122
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,457
Enjoy vision, Leonard. Enjoy it!

123
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:22,585
Not gonna lie, we were on the fence.

124
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:27,298
Your father is still against it,
but I was like, 'Larry, he deserves it.'

125
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:34,138
So, happy birthday, welcome to vision.
You get focus, Leonard. You get focus."

126
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,348
"Thank you, Mommy."

127
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,393
"No. No problem. Now you run and get
your Christmas crutches and hurry back.

128
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,857
We'll talk about that dentist trip
that's always been on your wish list."

129
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,906
By the way, quick announcement
to the lactose intolerant community.

130
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,077
If I offer you ice cream,

131
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,539
and you can't have any,

132
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,166
just say, "No, thank you."

133
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,260
That's it. There is no joke. That's just
the message I want to get out there.

134
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,263
I want to silence the lactose intolerant.

135
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,847
I don't need to know the havoc

136
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:20,142
dairy products are gonna wreak
on your bowels...

137
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,438
right before I'm about
to dig into my rocky road.

138
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,190
Are we clear? Are we good?

139
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:29,527
You didn't win an award.
Gotta work it into every conversation?

140
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,280
Why would you ever bring it up?
You can feel them wanting to bring it up.

141
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:35,199
They're, like, trying to work it in.
It's like double dutch for them.

142
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,117
They're like...

143
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,913
You could be at a buffet table.
You just feel it.

144
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,000
"That looks yummy, but I probably
can't have it. Wanna know why?"

145
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,548
"No. I don't care why. I have no interest.

146
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,010
Just the fact that I can enjoy it
without any problems is enough for me."

147
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,137
"You know what it is?
I don't want to bother you.

148
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,515
I'm just gonna let you know,
I'm lactose intolerant!

149
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,851
Totally intolerant to lactose.

150
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,355
Sorry, it's just better for both of us,
just so you know. It's out there.

151
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,065
I'm lactose intolerant.

152
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,568
And I do CrossFit.

153
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,905
That's it. That's all I wanted to say.

154
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,868
You know,
when I was first diagnosed LI, I...

155
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,249
I decided that very moment
I was gonna live every day to the fullest

156
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,295
and just not let the little things
bother me anymore, unless, of course,

157
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,838
they contain dairy.

158
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:35,009
Then they're gonna bother me
quite a bit then, but that's me.

159
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:40,806
That is my cross to bear and anyone
who can hear the sound of my voice.

160
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,475
That's it."

161
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,477
Lactose intolerant.

162
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,563
It didn't exist 30 years ago.

163
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,151
You can't name one person
who was lactose intolerant 30 years ago,

164
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,527
'cause it did not exist.

165
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,655
Actually it did.
It's called a tummy ache.

166
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,825
Toughen up, America. Toughen up!

167
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,207
If you're a man
and you're lactose intolerant,

168
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,168
why would you ever bring that up
to another man?

169
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,130
Can you imagine Spartacus? Like...

170
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,095
In the arena after, like,
twisting a tiger's neck, and he's like,

171
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,973
"What's that? Coffee with half-and-half?
I can't have that. I get booboo belly.

172
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,435
I can't do it. I'm lactose intolerant.
I'm lactose intolerant.

173
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,813
Do you have a non-dairy creamer?
Can you get a non-dairy creamer?"

174
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,065
Where are the men?

175
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,109
Where have they gone?

176
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,695
Know what I think of men?

177
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,365
I think of that picture in the 1930s
of those construction workers

178
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,200
sitting high above New York City,

179
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,911
right, sitting on that steel beam.

180
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:45,871
Right.

181
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,710
Just eating their lunch.
They're eating their lunch.

182
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,714
Can you imagine
if the fifth guy in was like, "Hey...

183
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,802
Is this cheddar cheese on my sandwich?
I can't have this.

184
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,848
I'm lactose intolerant."

185
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,225
"Is that like polio?"

186
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:10,563
"No! I get yucky tummy.
"You guys got to scootch over!

187
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,899
Move your knees, I gotta get by.
I gotta get by, guys!

188
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110
Let me by. Can you guys let me by?"

189
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,195
"We gotta lower the beam!"

190
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,573
They would throw him off the back
of that beam!

191
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:28,456
Lactose int-- there is not
a more annoying group on the planet.

192
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,917
Check that, a gluten douche.

193
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,510
My apologies, the gluten douche trumps
the lactose intolerant.

194
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,308
Because the lactose intolerant
is just annoying,

195
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:50,144
but a gluten douche is a night-wrecker.

196
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,981
Right? 'Cause they'll make you
switch restaurants. They'll be...

197
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,319
"I don't like this. Can we go where
they have some gluten-free options?

198
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,528
Do you mind if we switch restaurants?"

199
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:04,074
"No! Order what you want,
I'll eat the gluten out of it.

200
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,164
I'll regurgitate it
and feed you like a baby owl."

201
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,920
I made the mistake of picking
a restaurant. You can't do that.

202
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,588
I went with two guys.
I didn't even know them.

203
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:21,091
One was a gluten douche,
the other was lactose intolerant.

204
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,011
I chose a pizza restaurant! They're...

205
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,640
They're each tying to outdo each other.

206
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,975
"I can't have bread.
My stomach will bloat."

207
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,978
The other guy's like, "Can't have cheese.
I'll have to change my pants!"

208
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,315
One and up.

209
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:40,611
Out of the shadows like a ghost,
a guy with a nut allergy came over.

210
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,078
Yo, the nut allergy is the King Kong
of food allergies!

211
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,581
He was like,
"I'm sorry, you got some food problems?

212
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,417
Can I explain something to you?
Let me break it down for you, okay?

213
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,752
If I eat a nut...

214
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,047
I die. I die!

215
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,972
If a fork touches a nut
in this restaurant,

216
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,809
and I use that fork you gotta
jab an EpiPen into my chest

217
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,603
'cause I am on my way to the afterlife.

218
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,275
If the soil
where this building was built upon

219
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:23,195
ever harvested a nut or a seed
of some sort,

220
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,660
and I come in contact with it,
I'll melt into a pile of flesh.

221
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,414
If college kids are driving by
on the local highway,

222
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,418
and one tosses out a peanut shell
and the dust from that shell...

223
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:43,883
works its way through the air

224
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,219
and latches onto a nasal hair
and shimmies its way up,

225
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,929
I will explode!

226
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,475
And you'll be talking to a shadow
of where I used to be."

227
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,188
Okay, nut allergy guy, you win.

228
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,610
You win the food allergy competition.

229
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,237
Yeah.

230
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,954
Know who I feel sorry for?

231
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,332
Shellfish allergy guy. You remember him?

232
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,252
Remember him from the late '70s?

233
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:24,381
He was the only game in town.

234
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,218
There were no food allergies then.
He was just rare.

235
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,180
He was just sitting out there.
He was running the game.

236
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:37,019
Imagine him today, trying to bring up
his scratchy throat and puffy ankles?

237
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,355
Nut allergy guy would grab him
by the shoulders

238
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,440
and knee him in the face!

239
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,862
I'm very, very blessed,
because I don't have food allergies.

240
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,449
I know some are tough. I can go
to any restaurant I want, which is great.

241
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,201
I'm very fortunate.

242
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,329
I don't like going to restaurants where
the waiters are too excited to be there.

243
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,957
You ever get them?
"Hey, how's everybody feeling tonight?"

244
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:06,757
Slow it down, man. Let's take it down.
You know, he's very excited?

245
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,677
"How's everything going?
How's everything taste so far?

246
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,972
Can I get you anything else? No?
Is everything good now?"

247
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,392
Could you let the food hit the back
of my throat?

248
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,354
Ever have the waiter
that feels comfortable enough

249
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,148
to sit down at your table with you
to take your order?

250
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,736
"How's everybody doing? My name's Cooper.
What can I start you off with?"

251
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,031
"Well, Cooper, I think we'll all start off
with a nice big bucket

252
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,992
of get your ass out of my booth."

253
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,121
"Everybody, we're good with that?
Then maybe some jalapeño poppers?"

254
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,456
"Yeah, just your ass out of the booth
and jalapeño poppers."

255
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,462
That's why I go to restaurants
like Benihana.

256
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,298
I like Benihana 'cause it takes the waiter
out of it really. Yeah.

257
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,260
It does. It's awesome,
where they cook right in front of you.

258
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,137
It's good,
and they give you a little show,

259
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,849
which they need to update the show.
I will be honest.

260
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,813
I don't need to see another
smoking onion ring volcano.

261
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,237
Or shrimp in the hat?
Hey, shrimp in the hat.

262
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,157
What, am I a five-year-old at magic camp?

263
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:18,746
How about more shrimp on my plate?
Why not work on that at the Hana?

264
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:23,459
Yes, I'm disappointed in the Hana
with the amount of shrimp they give you.

265
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:27,671
It's all about seat placement.
You got to find the right place to sit.

266
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:31,008
And I chose the wrong one...
Third base.

267
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,762
And unless you get, like, a southpaw chef
which is very rare,

268
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,181
you're gonna get boned on the shrimp

269
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,392
'cause they start off very excited.
They're full of adrenaline.

270
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,312
Their math skills aren't the greatest.
They're just kinda...

271
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,440
turn into Pete Townshend in the beginning
dishing out the shrimp

272
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,651
and you just see the pile dwindling.
You see it just going down.

273
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,696
I'm like,
"He's not even gonna make the turn."

274
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,202
"This is not gonna work out for me."

275
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,496
And he's not even being selective
in who he gives it to.

276
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,998
He's giving the same amount
to a six-foot-four man

277
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,001
as a baby in a highchair
getting the same amount of shrimp.

278
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,923
I know I'm gonna be stuck
with two empty tails and an antenna.

279
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,926
I also didn't know at Benihana

280
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,179
you're supposed to wait
until all the food is served

281
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,139
before you start eating.

282
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,810
I'm literally eating it off the spatula
like a German Shepherd.

283
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,895
[chewing]

284
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,199
It's good. You guys are gonna definitely
like the rice!

285
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,287
I went and got ice cream.

286
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,208
That's one of the foods I don't mind
waiting for. It's so good.

287
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,710
It was a long line,
great little place we went to.

288
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,796
As we got to the front,

289
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,257
the lady in front of me had
to try every sample.

290
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,759
When did we introduce the pink spoons,
the samples?

291
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,554
Every one just come out.

292
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:02,224
By the way, two is the limit, right?
Or I'll give you three.

293
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:07,855
If you can't figure what type
of ice cream you want in three samples,

294
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,150
you need to stand
outside the ice cream shop

295
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,986
and just narrow it down mentally,
come up with a game plan,

296
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,865
'cause even if you're off a little bit,
it's ice cream.

297
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,786
I get it
if you want to try an exotic flavor

298
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,998
like Chattanooga citrus crunch
or something,

299
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,084
but she was like,
"Can I try double chocolate?" No!

300
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:34,381
No. No! Just imagine regular chocolate
in your head and then double it up.

301
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,635
No.

302
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,975
So great to be back in New York.
We're shooting a show out--

303
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,144
-[cheering]
-This is so great, thank you, guys.

304
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,361
We were shooting a scene in one
of the neighborhoods on Long Island,

305
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,822
and it was great 'cause all the people
came out and watched.

306
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,451
It was really fun, 'cause we got a chance
to talk to them in between shots.

307
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,372
I was talking to this one off-duty cop,
very nice guy, for ten minutes.

308
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:11,293
He was wearing a raincoat.
I don't know why. It wasn't raining.

309
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,796
He was great.
We had a nice little ten minute chat.

310
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,673
Then they called me back
to shoot the next scene.

311
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,175
I said, "All right, man,
take it easy, buddy."

312
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:22,179
He goes, "Hey, before you go, I got a gift
for you. I want to give you a cigar."

313
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,933
I said, "Thank you, that is just
unnecessary and very sweet of you."

314
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,686
He said, "Just do me a favor.
Just think of me when you smoke it."

315
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,406
I said, "What?"

316
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,952
"Yeah, when you smoke it,
do me a favor, just think of me."

317
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,247
I got weirded out,
and I didn't even know what to say.

318
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,749
I was like, "Yeah, cigar, I gotta..."
[mumbles]

319
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,543
I just walked off.
I thought, "How odd is that?

320
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,170
You don't give a gift to somebody

321
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,131
and then give them instructions
on how to enjoy it.

322
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:01,134
What if I want to think about my kids
or something else?

323
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:05,013
It was just a weird exchange.
I was freaked out. It was a good cigar.

324
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:09,351
I went home and put it on my desk
and I was like... [mutters]

325
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,438
It just made me feel weird.
It was a nice gesture. Then it got weird.

326
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,441
So I was like, "Forget it, man.
I don't need that cigar."

327
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,986
I left it there,
and then I went to work the next day.

328
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,697
And I came home, and I saw it again.
It brought up these emotions again.

329
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,823
And I was like...

330
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,744
"Guy makes me think of this.
This is crazy right now.

331
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,871
It's a good cigar.
I should smoke it, but I can't now

332
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,082
because I don't
wanna do what this guy tells me to do.

333
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:38,213
I got so angry at it.
I said, "Just throw it out." That was it.

334
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,674
I went to throw it out and I was like,
"No, don't throw it out.

335
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,677
If you throw it out, then he wins.

336
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,345
He wins."

337
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,766
Then I thought to myself,
"No, smoke it, but don't think of him."

338
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:55,397
And that's what I did, I smoked it.
But I could not not think of the guy.

339
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,319
I was literally like... [exhales]

340
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,113
[sighs]

341
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,782
"Man...

342
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,285
Cop in the raincoat. He got me!"

343
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:12,247
Can't get him out of my head. I could not
get him out of my head the whole time.

344
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,373
I only met him for ten minutes.

345
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,169
I smoked a whole cigar thinking about him
every second of that cigar.

346
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,589
And not just that cigar,
then it was every cigar I had!

347
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,470
And not just cigars, breakfast.
I couldn't get the guy out of my head!

348
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,890
I was literally like,
"I wonder what he's doing today.

349
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,893
It's pouring out.
I betcha he's wearing his raincoat.

350
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,561
Of course he's wearing his raincoat.

351
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:39,858
If he wore it with a chance of rain,
he's definitely wearing it today."

352
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,156
I keep thinking he's going to his friends,
telling them,

353
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,785
"I just gave Kevin James a cigar,
and I told him to think of me."

354
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,164
His friends were like, "You're out of
your mind. He's not gonna think of you."

355
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:58,794
He's like, "Nah, trust me.
He's gonna think of me.

356
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,631
It's gonna get in there and then it's
gonna spread. You watch this."

357
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,718
And look at me, I'm talking about him
on my Netflix special right here.

358
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,056
Well done, cop in the raincoat.

359
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,516
Well played, my friend.

360
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,310
I'm so blessed with this job.

361
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,728
I get to work with some
of the greatest people.

362
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:21,942
I got to work with Nick Nolte.
He's like-- Ah, man, he's...

363
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,237
He's one of my heroes, you know?
I was so nervous meeting him.

364
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,115
They were bringing me over to meet him
at this party.

365
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,326
And I see him. He turns around,
and he goes to shake my hand.

366
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,954
As he goes to shake my hand,
I see his hand's in a fist,

367
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,956
and I thought, "How cool is that,

368
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,792
that Nick Nolte's
gonna give me a fist bump?"

369
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,544
So I changed my hand to a fist,

370
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,130
but then Nick opened his up
at the last second,

371
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:47,884
and I didn't have time to pull out,
and Nick just latched onto my fist.

372
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,849
And he just started shaking my fist
like a Magic 8-Ball.

373
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,685
He was just going up and down
and in a weird octagon,

374
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,770
and I was freaked out.
He starts talking to me.

375
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,981
I can't concentrate on a word he's saying,

376
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,774
'cause all I'm thinking everybody
at the party's just thinking

377
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,445
that Nick Nolte just beat me
at some weird rock paper scissor game.

378
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,367
I always think Nick Nolte's at a party
telling other people that he met me.

379
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,995
"You ever shake hands with Kevin James?

380
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:20,500
He's got one normal hand
and then he's got can of soup!

381
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,045
He threw it at me.
I didn't know what to do. I covered it,

382
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:28,008
and he's trying to pull it away from me,
but I held on.

383
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:31,428
I held on for a long time,
like an eagle with talons."

384
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,565
They put me up at a great hotel here,
which is really fun. It's really nice.

385
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,860
I love being in the city.
I'm trying to go to my room.

386
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:50,197
The room signs, can they make those
any more difficult to read?

387
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,283
I'm in room 15,712.

388
00:24:56,203 --> 00:25:01,082
Okay, this is 6,415 through...

389
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:07,506
27,695.

390
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,761
Let me see what's over here.
What's over here?

391
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,264
No, this is 59,627.

392
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,434
I'm just gonna lay here. That's all.
I'm just gonna lay here.

393
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,524
I got in my room, and I was excited,
'cause I wanted to see the view I had.

394
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:29,528
Thought it'd be the park or something,
but I had another hotel right there.

395
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,572
I look out the window
and right away in another hotel window,

396
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,326
I see a guy standing there,
completely naked standing in the window.

397
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:41,456
I thought how weird is it
that that guy got there.

398
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,625
He was like, "Hi, room 715.
Thank you very much."

399
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,170
He got in, got in his room,
put his luggage down...

400
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,942
"Now we wait. We wait."

401
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,779
He was standing there.
He had his fists on his hips,

402
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:16,283
just like a naked superhero waiting
for someone to save.

403
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,868
I thought,
"How weird is this that he's doing this?"

404
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,955
Then I thought, "How weird that you're
looking at him from another hotel

405
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,790
locked on him like a puma, just..."

406
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,340
Turns out he wasn't just standing naked,
he was ironing. He just started ironing.

407
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:36,678
I didn't see the ironing board.
He was waiting for his iron to heat up.

408
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,471
That's a confident naked man

409
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,682
just standing in a window waiting
for your iron to heat up.

410
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:44,936
[imitates sizzle] "Nope, not..."

411
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:51,693
I gotta be honest, the list of things
I do naked is not very long.

412
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,406
But even if you were to add 800 things
to that list,

413
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,409
ironing still ain't gonna be on there.

414
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:03,788
Way at the bottom along with frying bacon.
It's way at the bottom.

415
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,877
Here's a list of the top five things
you're never gonna see me do naked:

416
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,878
jump...

417
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,881
climb a ladder...

418
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,134
install insulation in my attic...

419
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,387
sit on wicker furniture...

420
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:25,018
and feed geese.
I'm never feeding geese naked. That's it.

421
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,274
I got embarrassed. I went back in.
I had to go down to the lobby.

422
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,235
I got in the elevator. There were other
people in the elevator with me.

423
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,112
I pressed the lobby. You always expect
to go right to your floor,

424
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,447
but you ever get out too quick

425
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,494
and you're too embarrassed to go back,
so you're like, "Yeah, I'm good."

426
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,580
The people on the elevator
know you screwed up. They're like, "Sure you don't want
to get back on?"

427
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,919
"No, no, no, I need the basement.
I gotta check the pipes.

428
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,838
I'm the pipe checker here at the hotel.

429
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,762
We're good. You guys go.
I'll see you in the lobby in a minute."

430
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,516
And you walk over back there
and you press the button again,

431
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,435
but it's too soon, so the same people are
in the elevator when it opens up.

432
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,943
I love any form of transit
that moves you from one floor to another.

433
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,070
That's technology to me.
I appreciate that.

434
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,407
Like escalators.
I love a good escalator, man.

435
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,160
You appreciate an escalator when
you come upon a broken one at the mall.

436
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,038
"We'll head to Foot Locker,
then get a slice of pizza...

437
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,085
[sighs]

438
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,880
"Let's just do it tomorrow.
I'm out of here."

439
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,260
When you get on an escalator
do me a favor,

440
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,470
just grab the handrail
and just stand there.

441
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,765
Let life take over. Let it raise you
from one floor to another.

442
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:49,436
I can't stand the people
who still feel the need to walk.

443
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,438
Same idiots always.

444
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:55,483
It's usually the guy with the NutriBullet
full of greens. That guy's, "'Scuse me.

445
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,697
On the left, 'scuse me. 'Scuse me."

446
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:07,078
I don't let him by. I get all big.
I'm like, "Not happening! No. No!"

447
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,455
"'Scuse me!"

448
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,873
"Nope, not happening!

449
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,584
Big man pilate time."

450
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,591
I love those people movers at the airport,
but they're so random.

451
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,552
You could be walking with your luggage
for two miles...

452
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,097
then out of nowhere, the airport's like,

453
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,726
"You know what? Give him a little strip
of, like, 18 feet right there."

454
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:34,397
"Just 18 feet?"

455
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:38,193
"Yeah,  just 18 feet is plenty.
Just give them a false sense of hope

456
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,447
before they walk the additional 42 miles
into the parking garage.

457
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,454
I use them, though.
I could literally walk by a people mover

458
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,581
and be like, "They got a people mover.
I didn't see that."

459
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,046
Ever been on the people mover

460
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,216
and you realize there's somebody walking
outside the people mover

461
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,469
at the exact same speed as you?

462
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,848
You can't even make eye contact with him.
You just...

463
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:15,522
slowly turn yourself away from them.
It's when I do a lot of my deep thinking.

464
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,984
"What kind of a fat lazy sea lion are you?

465
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:24,906
You couldn't walk an additional 18 feet?

466
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,577
It's 18 feet, man!
You are a manatee, you know that?

467
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,538
You sicken me.

468
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:35,333
No more starting New Year's.
You're starting now.

469
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,835
Turn your life around!"

470
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,423
You feel so guilty. You turn around.
You feel like you owe the guy an excuse.

471
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,050
"I'd be walking with you, man,

472
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:48,555
but I just helped a friend move
this morning and...

473
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:54,644
then I ran a 5K... 66K,
a bunch of Ks. I'm not sure how many."

474
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,982
He's carrying four bags of luggage.
I'm holding a Wendy's bag, you know?

475
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:03,319
I'm not even holding it.
I'm resting it on the rails.

476
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,157
I can't even lift my fat lunch
for 18 feet.

477
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,582
You ever been on the people mover
and realize you're passing a Cinnabon?

478
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,340
[mouths]

479
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:35,268
There should be a handbrake
or an exit ramp.

480
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,063
If they did their research correctly,

481
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,983
they would realize the people
on the people mover...

482
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,199
That is your core Cinnabon audience!

483
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,044
If they were really smart,
they'd have every people mover

484
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,505
go directly into a Cinnabon, right?

485
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,799
Filtering in like a luggage carousel.

486
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,635
Fatties just falling in like,

487
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,805
"What the heck was that?
Oh, Cinnabon. Yeah, I'll take two.

488
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,600
Extra icing on both, please. Yeah."

489
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,936
[chuckles]

490
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,023
I love Cinnabon. I should not have it.

491
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,652
I gotta get in shape, I gotta...

492
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,615
I love sports. That was my dream,
to play professional sports.

493
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,284
That was my... Yeah. Yeah.

494
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,413
I don't think I have to tell you people
how that turned out,

495
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,541
but I still love it. I still love it.

496
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,877
I love sports, sports clothing.
I love Under Armour.

497
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,587
I told my manager,

498
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,340
I said, "Hey, I wonder
if we can get an endorsement deal.

499
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,676
Could you call Under Armour and see?

500
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,928
'Cause I noticed the Rock got one...

501
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,852
I thought maybe we can get one."

502
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:02,730
He was like, "You want me to call them?"

503
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:06,234
"Yeah, can you give 'em a call?"
He's like, "All right..."

504
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,362
He called me back five minutes later.
I was like, "That was fast."

505
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,989
He's like, "Yeah, that was fast."

506
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,659
I said, "How did it go?"
He said, "Not good.

507
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,329
In fact, they asked if you wouldn't mind
not wearing their clothes."

508
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:26,629
Be careful with the clothes you buy
when you're getting fat then lose weight.

509
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,381
You gotta
change your wardrobe accordingly.

510
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,259
I threw on a mesh shirt
from when I lost weight a long time ago,

511
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,552
and I went to work out in it.

512
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:36,431
Thank God I walked by a mirror.
I was like, "Oh, no, no, no, no."

513
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,017
I looked like a bag of avocados.

514
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,275
Took a little weight off,
I gotta get more weight off.

515
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,903
I was getting so big,
I was taking longer in the shower.

516
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,324
It was like washing a van, you know?
It was like...

517
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,829
I just started negotiating with myself.`

518
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:03,541
I'm like, "You know what?
I'm just gonna do the front today.

519
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:08,880
I can't be washing all day.
I got things to do, errands to run.

520
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,299
I'll get everything else tomorrow.
I'm done."

521
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,262
I get cold fat. Big people get cold fat.

522
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:20,433
Cold fat is when
your body temperature is 100% correct,

523
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:24,020
but there's a section of your body
that's just ice cold.

524
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,730
My wife will find it all the time.

525
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:29,275
She'll be like, "Your left love handle
is freezing right now."

526
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,779
She's not wrong. It's like
the blood said, "I can't do this.

527
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,947
I can't get from there back to the heart.

528
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,450
I don't know what you want from me.
I just can't make this--

529
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,828
You weren't this big
when we started together.

530
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:44,916
I can keep your shoulder warm,
but I say we let the love handle go.

531
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:49,128
Eventually it'll break off like an iceberg
and just float away from us."

532
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,715
Gotta get in shape, man.

533
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,177
I had to get a pedicure. I didn't know
what a pedicure was a month ago.

534
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,638
A pedicure is where somebody else
trims your toenails

535
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:02,558
'cause trimming the toenails with a cooker
in front prevents you from getting--

536
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:06,437
It's tough for big people.
It's daunting when you can't see it.

537
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:10,483
It's like diving for pearls. You gotta
hold your breath, go down, try to get...

538
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,450
Get as many as you can before
you black out. You're like, "Whoa."

539
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,579
Then you assess. You're like,
"I only got three! I got seven left.

540
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,665
This is gonna take some time."
You're coming in.

541
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,876
You try to do different angles,
trying to get your foot up on something.

542
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:35,216
You come in at a weird angle,
and you can't even see.

543
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:39,220
It's like detonating a bomb. You're like,
"Please don't take off the little toe!"

544
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,972
When your first move

545
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,308
to trim your toenails is back
and then forward

546
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,893
'cause you need momentum...

547
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,857
drop the ego and make that appointment.

548
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,860
I got my colonoscopy.

549
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,904
Little scary going in. Everything is fine.

550
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,658
I was nervous. The doctor called me
three days before, and he said,

551
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:02,451
"Here's how it's gonna go down, Kev.

552
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,620
The day before the procedure,
you don't eat at all.

553
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:06,164
The morning of the procedure,

554
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,959
I'm gonna take a camera,
and I'm gonna snake it into your colon.

555
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,211
I'm just gonna keep feeding it up there.

556
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,631
And don't worry.
If I see any abnormalities,

557
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm just gonna burn them off on the spot."

558
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,635
I was like, "Whoa...

559
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,889
I can't eat anything the day before?"

560
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,394
He's like, "No."

561
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,354
I'm like, "Why not<i>?"</i>
He said, "When we get in there..."

562
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,148
I was like, "We?"
He's like, "Yeah, the team."

563
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,774
I'm like, "The team?"

564
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,195
I always thought a colonoscopy
was an individual sport,

565
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,863
like bowling or archery. He's like, "When we get in there,

566
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,118
I want it to be like a clean highway.
I want it to be pristine."

567
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:47,872
I was like, "First off, you gotta
take the word 'pristine' off the table

568
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:50,082
if we're talking about my colon, okay?

569
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,045
'Cause my colon is not gonna look like
the poster in your office, I promise you.

570
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,965
The supermodel colons you got
in there all glistening and stuff.

571
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,468
Mine's gonna look like it went to war.

572
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:04,096
If it had a voice,
it would be like a Nick Nolte voice."

573
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,682
[imitating Nick Nolte]
"How you doing? I'm Kevin James' colon!

574
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,769
I'm his colon! [grunts]

575
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,438
Crap, Reggie. Crap."

576
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,817
I want to be around a long time.

577
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:20,529
I got four kids now, by the way.
Four little ones, yeah.

578
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,410
Do we have parents of young ones? Yeah?

579
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,371
Couple there. Yeah. Kids are great.

580
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,333
It's the greatest gift on the planet.
Children. There's no better gift.

581
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,835
When we had our first daughter,
I freaked out.

582
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,088
I told me wife,
"There's nobody on this Earth

583
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:41,050
I will ever love as much
as this little girl ever, ever again.

584
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,929
I'm just gonna pour all my love
into this child." My wife felt the same.

585
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,181
Then she got pregnant again.
We were worried.

586
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,434
We were like, "Wait, we just said
we love this one so much,

587
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,604
how do we split up our love?"

588
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,773
Honestly, we were nervous about it.

589
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,776
Our friends were like, "Relax.
Everybody goes through it.

590
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,279
It's unconditional love.
You love your kids equally."

591
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,115
And I gotta say, they were wrong.

592
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,167
I don't care for the second one,
I just don't...

593
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:23,509
She's just a little needy.
Every day, it's the same: "I'm hungry."

594
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:27,722
"Oh, really? That's some news.
We're all hungry, get in line."

595
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,517
She's my angel, that one.

596
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,395
She stops in the middle of the day.

597
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,897
She comes into my office middle
of the afternoon.

598
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,734
"Daddy, can I talk to you?"
I'm like, "Yeah, what's up?"

599
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,153
"I just want you to know, I love you."

600
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,072
Yeah, and I'm like,
"Are you kidding me? I love you."

601
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:48,659
She's like, "No! I love you so much."

602
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:52,246
I'm like, "I love you so much."
And she's like, "No!

603
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,543
I love you more than brownies."

604
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,421
I was like...

605
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,392
"Thank you. Thank you. I... I love you more
than gluten-free brownies."

606
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,231
What do you say?
I didn't know what to say.

607
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,782
The new one, our little new one,
she's not a daddy's girl right now.

608
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,866
I wish she was.

609
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:33,079
The other day, she was crying
standing in the hallway, late at night.

610
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:37,249
I told my wife, "Let me go deal with her.
It'll give me a chance to bond with her."

611
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,753
I walk into the hallway and I'm like,
"What's the matter, sweetheart?"

612
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,214
She stops me. She goes, "I want my mommy.

613
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,551
I don't want you.

614
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,347
Go downstairs."

615
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,607
The first thing she said threw me
the most. She said, "I want my mommy."

616
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,361
She didn't say, "I want mommy,"
like we both know who mommy is.

617
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,822
She said, "I want my mommy,"

618
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,741
like "I don't even know
who the hell you are."

619
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:17,081
Then in case I'm confused,
she makes it very clear:

620
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,041
"I don't want you!"

621
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:23,671
Not only that, I don't even want you
on the same floor as me.

622
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,923
You need to be a floor below me...

623
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:29,552
"Chubby." I think she said chubby,
I'm not sure.

624
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,763
It was late at night.
It was under her breath,

625
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,350
but I think I heard,
"Out of my face, fatty" or something.

626
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,441
Kids are just so amazing.
Kids have abilities adults don't have.

627
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,486
'Cause they can go places mentally,
they haven't been scarred by life.

628
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,946
They can just do it.

629
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,157
I was at a doctor's appointment.
I had to get a checkup.

630
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,700
I'm in the waiting room with my daughter.

631
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,327
We're the only people there.
We're there for, like, 20 minutes.

632
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:57,788
I'm going out of my mind. I am so bored.

633
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,333
I went through all the magazines,
and I couldn't take it anymore, you know?

634
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,754
She couldn't have been happier.
She was just sitting there smiling.

635
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,967
Finally, I was like, "What are you doing?"

636
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,971
She said, "The air around my hand tastes
like Rice Krispies."

637
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,566
First thing I thought was,
"She's gotta get checked out."

638
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,153
Then I thought, "What a gift that is.

639
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,698
The gift to be able to taste Rice..."

640
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,160
I gotta tell you honestly
the air around my hand right now

641
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:40,247
does not taste like Rice Krispies,
but I want that gift.

642
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,249
Imagine being stuck in traffic,

643
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,585
"This sucks, it's gonna be two hours.

644
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,962
Wait a second.
I got chicken cutlet forearms.

645
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,009
I totally forgot
about my chicken cutlet forearms!"

646
00:41:55,471 --> 00:42:00,100
An ability kids don't have is
the ability to wake an adult up gently.

647
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,938
They all do it the same way,
they walk in very stealth like

648
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,316
and stick their face so close to yours

649
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:11,695
you can feel the tiny pulsations of air
firing out of their baby nostrils.

650
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,657
And they speak at a volume,

651
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,118
as if they've been in a heated argument
with you for the last 25 minutes.

652
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,453
"Daddy!

653
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,375
Shea's foot keeps touching my foot!"

654
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,546
Okay.

655
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,923
After I peel myself off the ceiling,

656
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:33,217
I gotta breathe into a brown paper bag
for 20 minutes.

657
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,683
Putting kids to sleep is an art form.
Do you do it? Are you the one?

658
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,894
Mothers are fantastic at it.
I don't know what it is.

659
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,771
They're motherly, that's what it is.

660
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:49,650
My wife's so good at it because she wants
to be there. That's the thing.

661
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,152
By the way, when she gets there,
they feel comfortable.

662
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,654
When they feel comfortable,
they relax and go to sleep.

663
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,614
She's out of there eight minutes later.

664
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,076
Glitter shoots out the door.
Everybody's sleeping.

665
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,955
Every once in a while,
I'll get the call like a relief pitcher.

666
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,498
"Honey?" "Yeah?"

667
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:09,295
"Can you do me a favor?" "What's up?
Just watching the game. Tied up. 11th."

668
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:13,048
"Could you put the girls to sleep tonight?
Could you do me a favor?

669
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,388
"Yeah. You want me to do it?"

670
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,807
"Yeah, yeah that'd be nice.
Could you, please?"

671
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,891
"Um...

672
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,104
Yeah, I want to do it.
I so want to do it tonight.

673
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,105
Should I put them tonight?"

674
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,983
"They sleep every night.
That's how it works. Yeah."

675
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:33,986
"Okay, I'll do it right now.
I'm gonna go."

676
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:35,821
And we go. But I don't wanna be there.

677
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,364
I'm not thinking how much I love them.

678
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,326
I'm thinking how do I get these animals
to sleep and get back to the game.

679
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,163
But that's the problem,
'cause when you go in there anxious

680
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,248
and plan on being somewhere else
and getting out of there,

681
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:50,169
kids are like wolves, they can sense
when you don't want to be there.

682
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,379
First of all, they look at you funny
'cause you're not the regular.

683
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,464
They're just kind of like...

684
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,762
I get nervous right away.
I feel like a narc wearing a wire.

685
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,975
"Nothing. I just want to go to sleep.
Who wants to sleep with Daddy?"

686
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,770
You just gotta lay there.
It's a waiting game. That's all it is.

687
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:11,857
It's who can out-wait the other party.
That's who wins the putting to sleep war.

688
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:15,694
And sometimes you win.
Sometimes you wait there long enough,

689
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,946
they'll fall asleep,
you go back and watch the game.

690
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:21,825
Other nights, it's four in the morning.
You fell asleep.

691
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,827
They're up putting toothpaste
in a light socket.

692
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,749
You lost that one.
Just chalk it up to a loss. It's fine.

693
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,917
But don't engage with them.

694
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,754
You cannot engage with them
'cause their goal is to stay up forever. That's what they want to do.
They're very good at it. Professionals.

695
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:41,512
Don't talk to them, just lay down there
and just shut your eyes and don't talk.

696
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,098
Don't engage with them.
They're gonna be like, "Daddy?"

697
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:48,227
You're like, "Please, no. No Daddy.
We're going to sleep. Sleep time."

698
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,979
"Daddy, I love you."
"You shut up. You don't love me."

699
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,236
And when you think they're asleep,

700
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,407
do me a favor,
add 25 minutes to let that cement dry,

701
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:05,202
'cause that is the difference
between a rookie and a champion there.

702
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,164
Don't ever peek
to check if they're asleep,

703
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,457
'cause I promise you one of 'em

704
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,711
is gonna be standing over you
like a velociraptor, just kind of...

705
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,383
She will sense the heat in your eyelid
as it raises. She will elbow her sister,

706
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,428
boom, you just pressed reset
and added six hours to your night.

707
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,350
And even if you get them to sleep,
the dismount from the bed...

708
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,939
that is the most crucial move
of the evening.

709
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:38,318
You can undo all your hard work
with a sloppy dismount

710
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,780
because it's like a human game
of pick-up sticks.

711
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,743
You gotta move your body parts
without moving any of theirs.

712
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,119
You gotta get out of the bed.

713
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,996
I'm big, so when you roll to one side
of the mattress,

714
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,790
they come tumbling into the vortex.

715
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:56,170
Everybody's awake. Starting from scratch,
that's what I'm doing.

716
00:45:57,212 --> 00:46:00,716
You do bedtime stories with your kids?
I can't stand them.

717
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:02,926
They're not like when we were kids.

718
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:05,596
The kids are so young
they don't understand what you're saying.

719
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,474
It's about spending time
with mommy and daddy. That's all it is.

720
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,100
It was quick. It was three pages.

721
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,061
Tommy lost a bike.
Tommy hopped a fence. He found his bike.

722
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:17,691
Now it's about these children's authors,
the book is like <i>War and Peace</i>.

723
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,359
You gotta read the whole thing.
I'm like...

724
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,737
They're not even listening.

725
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,239
You ever do a little editing on your own,
where you're just like...

726
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:31,246
If a couple of pages get stuck together,
I'm not thumbing them apart. No.

727
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:36,043
Like, the other night, I read them
<i>Goldilocks and the Two Bears,</i> we get it.

728
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:40,672
The night before that,
it was <i>Horton Thinks He Hears a Who,</i>

729
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,425
Turned out to be nothing, good night.

730
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,057
Be careful what you say around kids.
Kids are like sponges.

731
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,767
They may not understand
what you're talking about,

732
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:54,144
but they will take what you said,

733
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,314
and they internalize it,
and then they throw it back out at you

734
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:59,358
at the most inappropriate time.

735
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,694
I was at a little girl's birthday party
with my daughter.

736
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,989
Outta nowhere, my daughter just goes,
"This cake tastes like beer."

737
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,243
No, no. No.

738
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,413
Two thoughts pop in my head immediately.

739
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,124
Number one, I have to convince
every other parent there

740
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:21,296
I have never, ever, ever given her
a taste of beer in her life,

741
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,175
and number two, now I gotta try the cake.
I gotta give it a shot.

742
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,392
The other day I was playing
with my daughter. She's two and a half.

743
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:35,853
She was wrestling with me.
She's on my chest. We were having fun.

744
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:38,272
Then all of a sudden,
the action slowed down a little bit.

745
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,567
She stopped, and she looked at me,
and she sneezed...

746
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,944
right in my mouth.

747
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,155
And I threw up on her...

748
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:49,449
immediately.

749
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:53,245
Not like a little puke,
like I... like a fire hydrant.

750
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,622
I knocked her off my chest.

751
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:59,209
It was that fast. It was achoo...
[retches]

752
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,169
The reason I'm telling you this

753
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,964
is my wife got mad at me
for throwing up on our daughter.

754
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,591
She was like, "Why?"

755
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,343
"That's your own flesh and blood,
why would you throw up on her?"

756
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,761
Why would I throw up?

757
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,639
This isn't me not wanting
to finish her tuna sandwich!

758
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:18,228
Mucus that originated in her was launched
unbeknownst to me

759
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,314
right in my mouth,

760
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:23,901
nothing but net,
hit that little punching bag in the back!

761
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,740
Why would I? Like I made a choice.

762
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,242
Like I was sitting there,
she sneezed in my mouth,

763
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,911
I had time to think.

764
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,830
It's just not right.

765
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,208
"We should take some toys away from her,
teach her a lesson.

766
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:43,921
You know what? Check that.
I'm gonna throw up on her, hold her legs.

767
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:47,007
You hold her legs. I'm gonna get her.

768
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,386
I got nothing.
You gotta hold those chunky little legs."

769
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:57,476
I thought about both our actions,
how similar they were

770
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,478
with different outcomes, right?

771
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,730
It's so violent, the body reaction,

772
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,983
but they're very similar
in a sneeze and throwing up.

773
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,570
But a sneeze is so enjoyable,
and she did it the right way, too.

774
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,447
'Cause when you're young,
you don't think to block a sneeze.

775
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,450
That's how you're supposed to sneeze.
You're supposed to just let it go.

776
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,953
That's why when we're home alone,
that's what we do.

777
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:19,831
We get the sneeze feeling.
Hey, nobody's here. [sneezes]

778
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,000
You just let it rip

779
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:25,337
and then you watch the pixie dust
in the light for 20 seconds.

780
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:33,512
Still can't feel my legs. This is awesome.
This is euphoria. I'm good.

781
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,976
Throwing up, man,
that's a different story. Ooh.

782
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:42,896
This was horrible.
I took my kids to an amusement park.

783
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,608
And we're there, and I know I can't
do the rides like when I was young.

784
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,987
I used to be able to do any ride.
I can't handle it anymore. I can't do it.

785
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,030
So I was like,
"I have to do something, though.

786
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:55,200
The day's starting to wrap up,
and I gotta get on a ride,

787
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,160
'cause my son hasn't seen me go on a ride
with him at all.

788
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,037
We haven't done anything
bonding together."

789
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,957
And I'm like, "I gotta pick one out quick
and just be a man.

790
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,834
I gotta go on some of these rides."

791
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,545
So I scouted which ones I could do
and not get sick.

792
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:09,339
I was like,
"Teacups, they're out for sure.

793
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,799
I'll throw up immediately."

794
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,092
But then I saw the pirate ship.

795
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,303
You ever see the pirate ship
that goes back and forth? No, no, no.

796
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,306
I scouted it. Believe me,
it's only three minutes first of all,

797
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,517
and it doesn't go up all the way around,

798
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,602
which I was worried about.
I thought it was gonna go over the top.

799
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,396
It doesn't. It's a very short ride.

800
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:28,442
So I said, "I'll do it." And I get my son,
"Hey, you wanna go be pirates, man?"

801
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,445
He's like, "Yes, Dad, let's do it."
So we get on the ship and we buckle in.

802
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:33,488
And we're like, "Yeah, let's do it." Boom.

803
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,073
By the time the ride got here,

804
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,161
I knew I made a massive miscalculation.

805
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:44,082
And I just said, "Ooh, this is not good.
This is not good."

806
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,168
I just knew. You know when you know
you're gonna throw up?

807
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,794
You're like, "No, no, no, no."

808
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:51,590
I was like, "I can't do it!"
I had to buckle down. I gotta be strong. I can't. My son will remember this
for the rest of his life.

809
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,221
He'll remember the time daddy threw up
on the pirate ship.

810
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:01,183
I can't do it. I gotta be a man.
I sucked it up.

811
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,560
I care too much about him
and his respect of me.

812
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:08,482
By the time the ship got here,
I didn't give a crap about my son.

813
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,402
I didn't care about anybody in the world. The only two people I cared about
was me and the kid

814
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,073
in front of the red button
who could stop this thing.

815
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,742
But he's not looking at me,
'cause he's looking at his phone,

816
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:22,370
probably on some carnie dating site
just swiping.

817
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,960
Now I'm really panicked.
Then the ship went back one more time.

818
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,838
You know when you get that water
in the back of your mouth?

819
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,426
Kind of like vomit's way
of ringing the doorbell. "Hey...

820
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,679
How's it going?
We're in the neighborhood.

821
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,810
We're gonna be coming by
in about a couple minutes or whatever.

822
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,062
I don't know if you have a mint handy
in the house.

823
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:48,355
You might want to get a mint ready.

824
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,566
There's a whole bunch of us, too,
so you should leave the garage open.

825
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:55,445
We'll see you. Yeah, we're coming back.
We are coming back. It's on."

826
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:57,656
So now I'm panicked.

827
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,700
I'm praying that there's a little girl
in front of me.

828
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,577
I'm hoping she throws up...

829
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,956
so I can piggyback my puke with hers

830
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,918
and try to hide it from my son,
'cause my son's here. I'm a big guy.

831
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:14,589
If I can puke with her and throw it
this way or at least blame her.

832
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:18,385
She didn't puke, but I did.
I threw up big...

833
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,428
in my mouth...

834
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,098
And I swallowed it.

835
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,770
'Cause that's what a man does!

836
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,776
Take that, lactose intolerance!

837
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,156
And that's what men do.

838
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,534
Then we got fake tattoos
and got cotton candy after that.

839
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,245
So good, all food.

840
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,414
I can't. I get too fat and then I...

841
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,126
I lose weight, gain weight
and lose it again.

842
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:55,380
That's why I can't get a tattoo
unless it's like an accordion.

843
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,842
I just can't pull the trigger.

844
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,971
Do we have any tattoo people
here today? Yeah, you got?

845
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,640
-What's your name?
-Roscoe.

846
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,060
Roscoe? How's it going, bud?
Nice to see ya. How many you have?

847
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,103
[Roscoe] Three.

848
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,315
-Three? Give me one, what you get?
-A Tasmanian devil.

849
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,983
You got a Tasmanian devil?

850
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:20,989
Why'd you do that? Just 'cause you liked--
You were 19. That says a lot right there.

851
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:26,828
Cool. You got a Tasmanian devil,
what else? You got three?

852
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,122
-A clown in shackles.
-A clown in shackles...

853
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,924
First one's kinda cute, right?
The Tasmanian devil, but then...

854
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,887
Roscoe got a clown in shackles.

855
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:48,516
A clown on its own is weird enough.
Can you imagine that?

856
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,519
They don't even see that
at the tattoo shop very often,

857
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:55,232
but you were like, "We're almost done,
I want shackles on this guy.

858
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,109
You never know when he's getting away.
You just gotta keep him down."

859
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,489
What was the purpose of the shackles
and the clown? What does that represent?

860
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,407
-I forget.
-You forget, good.

861
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,619
I don't know if I'm buying that, Roscoe.

862
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:12,791
You don't get a clown in shackles
unless you're huffing paint somewhere.

863
00:54:13,792 --> 00:54:15,961
Out in Yaphank. I don't think you're...

864
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,214
You can't forget something like that<i>.</i>

865
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,467
You got shackles and a clown.
What happened, man?

866
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,512
You were in Maui. Okay.

867
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,265
-I was a little high.
-You were a little high.

868
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:35,438
He's also got a straight jacket. Okay.
Now it's starting to make sense.

869
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,943
You could've stopped at Maui. I was good.

870
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:45,240
Anybody got more than Roscoe,
any more than three? You got a few here?

871
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,324
What's your name?

872
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,286
Hi, Selena, give me one of your tattoos.

873
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,578
[inaudible]

874
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,581
Oh, that's so sweet.
It's your's mom's actual handwriting?

875
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,667
You took it from a piece of paper?

876
00:54:55,750 --> 00:55:00,672
That's sweet, that means something,
Roscoe clown with shackles! I get that.

877
00:55:01,172 --> 00:55:06,303
That makes sense. She wasn't high in Maui
doing crazy meth, you nutjob!

878
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,015
Keep going, Selena, you talk.

879
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,936
Two what? Two Hello Kitties?
All right, you're off the hook, Roscoe.

880
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,443
How many you got? Seven? What's your name?

881
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,321
-Billy.
-Hey, Billy. Nice to see you, bud.

882
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,198
You got seven?
Give me one of 'em. What did you get?

883
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:32,996
Bill, look at me, man. What the heck
is wrong with you? He's like...

884
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,915
You can jump right in.

885
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,793
When I finish my sentence,
you can pop right in.

886
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,795
That's how conversation works.

887
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,467
I feel like I'm talking to somebody
in Tel Aviv or something, you know?

888
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,012
"How's it going down there, Billy?
Is everything all right?"

889
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,436
[mouthing]

890
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,944
"Everything is great, Kevin. Thank you."

891
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:15,747
Give me one of them. What is it?

892
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:19,250
-A lion.
-A lion. You just got a lion?

893
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,961
What does the lion represent?
What did you get that for?

894
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,257
It's a long story? We got plenty of time.
We're just shooting a special.

895
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,553
What is it?

896
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:37,352
You're a Leo. That wasn't so long.
That was pretty quick. Wow.

897
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,233
Okay.

898
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:51,449
So you got a lion. That's cool.
What else? Give me another one, Bill.

899
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:54,244
You got the Grim Reaper.
Okay, we're moving on.

900
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,872
We don't need to talk to Billy all night.

901
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:00,959
Okay, you got the Grim Reaper.

902
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:05,130
You got Jesus, too.
Balance it out, yeah, you need that.

903
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,638
If you're gonna get the Grim Reaper,
you have to get Jesus.

904
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,640
Okay, what else you got?
Give me another one.

905
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,894
You got some Chinese thing.
"I got some Chinese thing."

906
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,278
We could tell it means a lot to you.

907
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:33,324
That's a fun day at the tattoo shop
for Billy, huh? "What do ya got?"

908
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,120
I got a lion,
got the Grim Reaper, got Jesus...

909
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,415
I need a Chinese thing.

910
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:43,877
You got like a Chinese thing?

911
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,172
Chinesey, but not.
It's kinda like a thing.

912
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:51,009
Just Chinesey thing, just something.

913
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,553
What's a Chinese thing? What is it?

914
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:58,516
It's supposed to be "live for today,"
but the Grim Reaper fights that.

915
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,896
You got it all.

916
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,192
You got it all happening
on your back, right?

917
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:12,530
Another on the front. What you got there?
An Irish thing...

918
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:21,998
Are you Irish?

919
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:24,584
You're not even Irish. Wow!

920
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:33,551
You just were everywhere, all over.
Do you have any tattoos you regret?

921
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,014
No, you don't regret any of them.
Good for you. I like that, Billy.

922
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,350
At least you own up to it, good. Yeah.

923
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,354
You see people who regret them,
and I feel horrible.

924
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:46,356
I saw this one guy on the internet,

925
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:50,860
on the inside of his arm, it said,
"Never don't give up." Oh...

926
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:59,077
I felt so bad for him,
'cause we know what he wanted to say,

927
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,912
and he was so close!

928
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,166
'Cause "don't give up" works
or "never give up" works,

929
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:09,212
but he backed his ass
into a double negative.

930
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,466
And that's two stupid people,

931
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,052
'cause you know the tattoo artist
could have said something at some point.

932
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,598
I just wrote, "Don't give up."
Want me to put "never" in front of it?

933
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:24,477
Yes, put "never" in front
of "don't give up," okay?

934
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,146
A little less this and a little more...
[imitates tattoo needle]

935
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,863
You don't even have to go to a shop
to get a tattoo anymore. You know that?

936
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:38,157
They have a service called Tattoo 2 U,

937
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,287
where they will send a van to your house
to give you a tattoo.

938
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,957
"Yeah, how you doing?
Listen, I got like three DUIs.

939
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:52,338
I'm currently under house arrest.

940
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,259
I'm pretty hammered right now, but...

941
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:01,556
I need the Tasmanian devil
on my left ass cheek immediately.

942
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:07,687
I need a clown in shackles
just hanging out

943
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:12,108
around my waist line.
Could you guys send a van?

944
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,486
