1
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:08,049
[crowd cheering, applauding]

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,018
[whistling]

3
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,440
-[whooping]
-How you doing?

4
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,775
No shit.

5
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,653
Thank you, thank you.

6
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,281
How you guys doing? All right.

7
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,534
Thank you very much.
It's great to be in Austin, Texas.

8
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,036
-Um...
-[crowd cheers]

9
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:36,995
Yeah.

10
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,124
When I do the road,
I leave a wife and two small kids,

11
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,877
and, uh, she's... 
she's pretty attached, you know.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,628
-Um...
-[crowd laughing]

13
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,589
She cries when I leave.

14
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,841
[laughs] Like...

15
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:50,967
[crowd laughing]

16
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:51,885
...all the time.

17
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,553
Yeah, she does.

18
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,474
I leave, and she's like... [tearfully]
"It's gonna be hard when you're gone."

19
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,727
And then I have to do, like,
an acting exercise, and I'm like...

20
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,689
[tearfully] "It's gonna be hard 
for me, too." You know?

21
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,108
It's not hard. [laughs]

22
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,152
It's fun.

23
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,656
I just did it backstage on the phone,
like five minutes ago.

24
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,329
She's like...
[tearfully] "I'm all alone at the house."

25
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,665
And I was like... [tearfully] 
"I'm all alone out here." You know?

26
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,084
No, I'm not.

27
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,754
Yeah.

28
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,716
She's great. She's great. I love her.
I love the kids more, but I do love her.

29
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,345
Well, it's a different love, you know?

30
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,223
Like, I don't want to fuck the kids.
So there's a start.

31
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,231
"That's good, Tom." So...

32
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,654
It is beyond your capacity to explain
how much you end up loving your kids.

33
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,198
It is.
And, like, now I'm on that side of it,

34
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,660
so I get to be amused
by people who don't have kids

35
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,495
who swear that they get it.

36
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,579
That's my favorite.

37
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:05,583
Like, to hang out with a friend
who doesn't have any kids, and he's like,

38
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,503
"Yeah, man, I see that you love your kids.

39
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:12,215
I totally know what you're feeling
because...

40
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,509
I love my dog."

41
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,137
And I'm like, "Yeah."

42
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,721
No.

43
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,765
I'm not diminishing pet love.

44
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:22,475
Pet love is real.

45
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,810
-[woman] Yes!
-Absolutely.

46
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,938
I've had pets my entire life.
It's the best.

47
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,607
I've rescued animals.
I encourage you to do it.

48
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,360
I have a dog that I adore.

49
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,948
But here is the difference
between my love for that dog and my kids.

50
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,785
If that dog were to hurt one of my kids,

51
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,205
immediately and without question...

52
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,833
I would drown that dog, right?

53
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,255
And I mean, through yelps like...
[yelping]

54
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,590
I'd go... [grunts] Like that.

55
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,803
And then I would give it to my son.

56
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,349
I'd be like, "Remember when that hurt you?
I killed it."

57
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,978
He'd be like, "What the fuck...

58
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,065
am I supposed to do with this dead dog?"

59
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,068
And I'd go, "I don't know.
Maybe learn to stand up for yourself

60
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,196
so I don't have to do shit like that,
all right?"

61
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,574
I know.

62
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,202
It's a very divisive joke. It has been...

63
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,205
the entire tour. Um...

64
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,835
I think it sets up the audience
into two camps, you know?

65
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,464
People who are like, "Don't do the yelp."

66
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,050
[yelps]

67
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,136
"It makes it real."

68
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,097
Then other people who are like,

69
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,225
"Do the yelp.
That's my favorite shit, man." And...

70
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:47,936
you know who you are.

71
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,230
Yeah.

72
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,982
Dude, having kids makes you do crazy shit.

73
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,194
I'm not even proud of some 
of the things I've done, all right?

74
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,782
Last year was the first time
I ever had somebody bully one of my kids.

75
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,991
I didn't respond well.

76
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,911
This is what...
I took my older son to a park.

77
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,246
He was two and a half.

78
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,997
The cutest little fucking kid.

79
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:12,502
And he walks into the park,
and he walks up to a playground set.

80
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,714
And, as he walks up to it, he steps on it,
and an older kid...

81
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,049
Meaning four.

82
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,012
He goes,
"You can't play with that. That's mine."

83
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,765
And I go,
"I'll kick your chest through your back."

84
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,145
And he goes, "What?"

85
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,439
And I go, "I'll stomp you out right now!"

86
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,651
So he's crying. I'm laughing.

87
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,611
Everybody's gathered around, right?

88
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:42,949
You can't do that.

89
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,327
You can't do anything to a shitty kid.

90
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,539
You can curse a lot around them.

91
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:52,208
Not to them.
That's an important distinction.

92
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,793
Around them,

93
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,838
and then you fantasize
about them repeating it at home

94
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,008
and getting in trouble,
and that's very satisfying, all right?

95
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,095
But, you know, you gotta put rhythm to it,
or they won't remember,

96
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,722
'cause they're just dumb fucking kids.

97
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,307
So you've got to be like,

98
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,309
♪ Shit, piss, motherfucker
Cunt, my balls ♪

99
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,144
♪ Lick my dick, eat my ass ♪

100
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,645
And the kid'll be like...

101
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:16,899
"What's that?"

102
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,110
I'd be like, "Go tell your mom.
That's what that is."

103
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,074
As they walk by,
you can get in one accidental hit.

104
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,826
I've tried it, but it's got to...

105
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,578
As they're passing, you know.

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,872
Like that, and then they'll be like...

107
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,296
[tearfully] ♪ Shit, piss
Motherfucker, cunt, my... ♪

108
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,510
You ever meet somebody,

109
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,389
and they're so boring,
you feel like they poisoned you? Like...

110
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,186
you're talking to them, and you're like,
"I feel like I'm dying right now.

111
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,480
And I think you did it."

112
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,068
This guy's name is Craig. 
I met him... [laughs]

113
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,527
I made sure to get it.

114
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,364
I was like, "I'm gonna remember you
for the rest of my life, man."

115
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,115
He-- I met him at the bank.

116
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,076
Is he a bank teller?

117
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,077
No.

118
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,453
Is he a security guard?

119
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,371
Nope.

120
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,789
What's his job?

121
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,584
I don't know. Whatever they call that guy
that stands in the lobby...

122
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,089
of banks now. Where you walk in, 
and you're like, "Do you work here?"

123
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,132
And he's like, "I think so." That guy.

124
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,343
The lobby liaison.

125
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,389
Well, I saw him. We made eye contact.

126
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,767
I don't know how you work.
For me, if we make eye contact...

127
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,727
During the day. Not at night.

128
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,104
But during the day...

129
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,647
[laughs]

130
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,066
...out of human decency, 
I acknowledge you.

131
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,234
So that's what I did.

132
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:44,404
We made eye contact, and I go,
"How you doing?" And he went...

133
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,616
And I was like, "Okay, so..."

134
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,204
Then I get to the second set of doors
to walk in.

135
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:57,125
And, as I reach for that door,
I hear, uh, "You going to the bank?"

136
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,840
I go, "Is this still a bank?"

137
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,591
He goes, "Yeah."

138
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,884
I go, "I'd like to."

139
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,512
And he goes, "Go for it."

140
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,721
And I was like...

141
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,391
"Okay.

142
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,143
Thanks."

143
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,520
And then I reach back...

144
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,606
and he goes,
"I'm going to Virginia next week."

145
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,653
"Are you telling me that?"

146
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,283
He goes, "You said, 'How you doing?'
when you got here.

147
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,160
I had to think about it.

148
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,162
That's what I'm doing."

149
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,956
I go, "That's the craziest shit
I've ever heard anybody say.

150
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,376
And also not how that question works,
but all right."

151
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,506
And now I reach back, and now he goes,

152
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,842
"Yeah, my sister lives there,"
and I'm like...

153
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,055
"How long has she lived there?"

154
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,725
Now I'm roped in.

155
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,561
He goes, "Fifteen years."

156
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,272
And I go, "You've never been?"
And he goes, "Uh-uh."

157
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,985
Now I'm starting to look at him like,
"Hey, man, do you drive to work or...

158
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,946
does somebody drop you off?"
You know what I mean?

159
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,368
I think he... [laughs]

160
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,664
Yeah.

161
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,376
I think he could see it in my face...

162
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,004
because, out of nowhere,
he goes, "I drive."

163
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,715
I was like, "That's cool, man.
That's cool.

164
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,134
I drive, too. That's crazy. Uh...

165
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,887
I gotta get in here."

166
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:37,350
He goes, "Yeah, we're gonna check out DC,
and we're gonna see some monuments."

167
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,561
I go, "I would love to hear about it,
but I have to make a deposit."

168
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,023
He goes, "I'll be here when you walk out."
I go, "You motherfucker."

169
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,193
Fuck that guy.

170
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,071
And fuck everybody like him.

171
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:55,201
If you have the audacity
to tell people how you're doing

172
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,078
when they say, "How you doing?"

173
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,455
that shit is rude and selfish, all right?

174
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,874
I'm serious.

175
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,835
There are two acceptable answers
to "How you doing?"

176
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,879
"Fine" and "great."

177
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,757
And if you're miserable, you say, "Fine."

178
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,594
You don't burden people
with your real-world problems

179
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,471
during a courteous exchange.

180
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:16,973
Yeah.

181
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,269
It's true.

182
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,980
You know why?

183
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,774
Because nobody
wants to hear your problems.

184
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,901
Your problems make my dick soft,

185
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:32,238
and I am trying to stay hard out here.

186
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,155
Now...

187
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,706
You know who's got a good system going on?

188
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,251
Rodrigo Duterte,
the president of the Philippines.

189
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,713
[laughs] Yeah, well, if you're not aware,

190
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,883
the president of the Philippines
is a super cool guy, and...

191
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,970
he has a lot of fun ideas. [laughs]

192
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:01,934
One of them is that he employs
motorcycle murder squads...

193
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,606
to go out and kill people on sight.

194
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,400
No arrest, no trial.

195
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,651
Who does he do it to?

196
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:15,489
Drug dealers and suspected drug users.

197
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:17,825
"Suspected."

198
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,662
Do you know how many tired people die
every day in Manila?

199
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,165
Isn't that crazy to you?

200
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,835
You can walk out of your house
at five in the morning, like, "Oh, shit."

201
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,879
And then you hear... [revving]
You're like, "Oh.

202
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:35,843
I'm up!"

203
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,014
They roll up next to you, "You high?"
You're like, "I just got up."

204
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,433
They're like, "Mm, you're high."
Pow. Kill you.

205
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,645
It's horrific.

206
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,355
It's reprehensible.

207
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,231
And I hope that we adopt it here.

208
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,149
Not...

209
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,028
Not for drug usage, obviously.

210
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:59,200
I think we should reserve it for people
who have public speakerphone conversations

211
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,786
with their phones in front of their face
like this.

212
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,038
-[crowd cheering]
-You know? Yeah.

213
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,711
Who are these people just walking around,
oblivious to the world around them?

214
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,421
You're waiting in line to buy a coffee,

215
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,966
you have to hear a fascinating,
two-way tale amplified.

216
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,762
It's always like... [in distorted voice]
"Where were you last night? [gibbering]

217
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,265
[continues gibbering]

218
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,689
[retches]
Slice their fucking throat, right in line.

219
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,400
Kick the the body.
"Can I have a coffee?" So...

220
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,528
Too violent? I get it. So...

221
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,116
You know whose balls
I'd love to slam in a mailbox...

222
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,952
for 20 minutes straight?

223
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:50,418
Grown men who board 6:00 a.m. flights
who have never seen clouds before.

224
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:51,460
I don't know...

225
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,296
if...

226
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:59,885
you've ever had the good fortune
of boarding an early morning flight

227
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,223
where there's an unspoken agreement,
"We're gonna keep it nice and dark

228
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,767
so we can rest along the journey."

229
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,187
But there's always some TikTok in 16C...

230
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,731
[crowd cheering]

231
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:13,399
Yeah.

232
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,780
One guy who's sitting there, who's like,
"I've never seen a cloud like that.

233
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,540
Oh! There's another one right there."

234
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,085
"Are you fucking four?

235
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,256
Shut the shade, tit-slap.
We're trying to get some rest."

236
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,304
And people who put stick figures
and the names of their family members

237
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,848
on the rear windshields of their car.

238
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,605
They should be publicly executed...

239
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,650
in their car so we can keep score
on the window, you know.

240
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,280
Isn't that insane to you?

241
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,824
Don't you have any protective instincts?

242
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,660
I mean, it's crazy.
You pull up at a random red light,

243
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:10,623
and the car in front of you is like,
"It's funny that you didn't ask, but...

244
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,669
inside are Mommy and Daddy...

245
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,006
and Brian and Marissa.

246
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,676
And there's a soccer ball next to Brian...

247
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,805
because Brian loves soccer."

248
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,474
Oh.

249
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,852
Does Brian love getting molested?
Because...

250
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:39,443
you put his name and favorite thing
out there as bait to society.

251
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,238
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

252
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,951
Why don't you put your home address
and his daily schedule

253
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,285
right fucking next to it?

254
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:52,915
"Brian's up at six, home at one,
bath at seven. [giggles]

255
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,210
Come over if you want to join us."

256
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,753
It's not okay.

257
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,256
[sighs]

258
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,173
Guys...

259
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,594
have you ever thought
about how many times

260
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,389
you may have slept 
with your significant other?

261
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,517
You shouldn't know the answer.
So let me just start there. All right?

262
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,103
If you do, that's terrifying, and...

263
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,980
we'd like you to leave.

264
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,859
Yeah. If you're sitting here like,
"Finally, somebody asked.

265
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,153
It's 926!"

266
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,782
There's the exit. What I'm saying...

267
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,662
I'm saying, as a concept,
it is reasonable to assume,

268
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:36,208
if you've been with somebody three years,
you have a healthy thing going on,

269
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,086
you may have slept together
a few hundred times.

270
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,379
Right? Right.

271
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,384
Now, I want you to think about
how many times your dad...

272
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,889
has finished inside of your mom.

273
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,518
So many times!

274
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:59,356
[in Southern accent] 
"Tom, why would you say that?"

275
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,779
Well, basically, I think all of our moms

276
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,115
are a bunch of cum dumpsters,
you know, but...

277
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,493
Your mom more than my mom. Now...

278
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,248
Ew, I know, it's a tough image

279
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,001
to get out of your head 
once I've planted it, right?

280
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,462
You're like,
"Goddamn it, my mom's dripping?"

281
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,796
Probably, yeah.

282
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,383
Soaking wet. Look...

283
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,847
your mom has done some nasty shit.

284
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,974
Let's talk about it.

285
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,142
[laughs]

286
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,024
She really has. And, uh...

287
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:44,818
Look, I'm here to defend her, all right?

288
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,528
It is not her fault.

289
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,198
It's your dad's fault, for sure.

290
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:53,535
Your dad, with all due respect,
is kind of a piece of shit. A little bit!

291
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:55,621
And if you're like, "Not my dad.

292
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,581
He's good..."

293
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,499
Yeah, to you.

294
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,585
He's not always like that to your mom.

295
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,171
If they've been together three decades,

296
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,132
you don't think he says
some off-colored shit...

297
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,344
every now and then? Of course he does.

298
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,637
They're laying in bed.

299
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,349
Your dad's tossing and turning.
He can't sleep. [grunting]

300
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,185
And your poor mother,
"Is everything all right, dear?"

301
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,145
"It's fine."

302
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,606
"Was supper good?"

303
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,608
"Yeah. Shut up, I'm trying to sleep."

304
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,153
"Can I do anything to help?"

305
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,489
"Yeah. You can lick my balls, all right?"

306
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,574
You want to know something?

307
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,244
Your poor mother, she does it,
all right? She...

308
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,081
Because she's a ball hog.
So your mom gets down there...

309
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:41,834
[weeps]

310
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,340
[weeps]

311
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,011
And she goes, "I like my life."

312
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,095
[weeping]

313
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,766
Oh, your mom. Now...

314
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:00,686
Your grandma.

315
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,230
Think about some of the things
that she's done.

316
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,568
On the railroad tracks
or wherever she used to fuck around.

317
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,447
[laughs] El Paso. I don't know. Uh...

318
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,327
You're like,
"Why are you saying this stuff, Tom?"

319
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,537
'Cause I'm having fun.

320
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,705
[laughs]

321
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,166
Because I enjoy upsetting people.

322
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,711
[laughs] Yeah. I don't know
what it says about me psychologically,

323
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,756
but there is... I don't know,
there's, like, a marching band

324
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,467
inside of me right now,
going, "Good job, good job."

325
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,552
Yeah.

326
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:37,931
'Cause, internally, I picture somebody
out there going like, "I was having fun...

327
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,935
until he talked about my slut mom."

328
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,522
And it makes me happy. I don't know.

329
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,984
It'll upset somebody,
and they'll try to tell me.

330
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,278
I say they'll try to tell me

331
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,323
'cause they'll send me a message
that I'll never read and...

332
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,909
No, no, I used to. 
I used to read them all.

333
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,788
And it took me a long time to figure out
you shouldn't read every message.

334
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:05,042
I don't think any performer
should digest everything sent their way.

335
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,753
And I didn't know that for a long time,
you know,

336
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,631
and I wish I had known that
'cause it kind of gets to you, you know?

337
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,717
The first time I actually got in trouble
for saying something

338
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,344
was about five years ago.

339
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,472
I got in trouble for saying "Gypsy"
on television.

340
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,392
Yeah. I didn't say anything nice 
about them, so let me...

341
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,937
rephrase it. [laughs]

342
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,148
I was just like... I was on a show.
I was like, "Who doesn't hate Gypsies?"

343
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,066
And then...

344
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,528
everybody on the show was like,
"We're with you," but...

345
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,781
afterwards, they found out.

346
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,033
And they reached out.

347
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,285
Like the president of the Gypsies...

348
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,704
sent me a message.

349
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,916
I guess she stole someone's phone.
So she sent me this message.

350
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,001
[crowd laughing, applauding]

351
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,841
We can tell who travels. So, uh...

352
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,509
she sent me this message.

353
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:59,555
She was like, "You said the G-word
on tele--" I was like, "Huh?

354
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,598
The G-word?"

355
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:06,562
I'm a grown man. And this is over e-mail.
She's being a real B-word. And so...

356
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,483
I didn't want to push her,
make her a C-word. You know what I mean?

357
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,111
Where my N-words at?
All right, well, look...

358
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:15,863
Hey, man...

359
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,032
it's modern comedy, get with the program.
Now...

360
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,118
Then she went on.

361
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:25,789
She goes, "Well, just so you know,
we're very proud of our ethnicity."

362
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:29,793
And I was like, "Yeah, you should be.
I mean, you have nothing else. [laughs]

363
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,755
I hope you're good at camping." [laughs]

364
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,384
Hey, I was giving her a compliment.

365
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:42,514
I was saying, "I enjoy your ethnic pride,
because you've earned it."

366
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,350
And frankly, I don't think everybody has.
All right?

367
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,103
Every group's like, "We're the best."
No, you're not.

368
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,814
It's impossible
for everybody to be the best.

369
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,109
I'm serious. Every group, they're like...
[gibbering]

370
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,906
No. I mean, just as an example, okay,
just to, like, lay this out:

371
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,201
How many people in the room,
let's say, are Italian for instance?

372
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,869
-[crowd cheers]
-Okay.

373
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:09,750
Now, aren't the rest of you a little sick
of hearing from them? Like... Right?

374
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,170
"Hey, we're the best! Fucking pasta!"

375
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,838
You're like, "All right." So...

376
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,425
Pasta's Chinese. Calm down. Now...

377
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,303
Anyways, after that,
I kept reading messages.

378
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,763
Reading, reading, reading.

379
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:28,060
And then a little while ago,
I got, in one six-week period,

380
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:34,775
200,000 e-mails and messages
just from the state of Louisiana,

381
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,528
over jokes that I had told in a special.
Now...

382
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:43,992
if you don't know,
I had a joke in a previous special...

383
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,744
-and...
-[crowd cheering]

384
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,870
Yeah, it's fine.

385
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,335
It was a very silly joke.

386
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,921
The joke essentially was I said,
"You know what?

387
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,798
We should build a wall in this country,

388
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,300
but we should build it
around that dumb fucking state."

389
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,802
That was my joke. Now...

390
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:06,181
Look, I'm so dumb, I was like,
"Everybody will like that joke."

391
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,140
No, they don't.

392
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,269
Not the people you made it about.

393
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,315
I got so many misspelled death threats
and, uh...

394
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,780
I was like, "Is this Creole?
What the hell are they trying to tell me?"

395
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,538
I got asked about it so much,
I was on the news about it...

396
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,207
that I just volunteer it now, okay?

397
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,583
So here's the truth.

398
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:37,045
I never would have shit on them
as hard as I did

399
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:40,507
if I had been to Arkansas,
which I now have.

400
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,884
What? What!

401
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,556
What...

402
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,226
a fucking dump that place is.

403
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,272
I think, when people flush their toilets
in Louisiana,

404
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,316
it all comes up in Arkansas. It...

405
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:02,904
It smells like broken dreams
and buttholes and...

406
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,324
a little bit of barbecue, but...

407
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,743
Here's what's fascinating.

408
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,287
Most of you will never experience this,

409
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,541
but if you ever offend
a large group of people,

410
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,294
like, let's say, an entire state...

411
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,381
you end up learning a lot about them.

412
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,133
You don't want to.

413
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,469
But they insist, so...

414
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,932
Yeah. I know everything
about Louisiana now. It's the worst.

415
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:36,146
I'm like an unofficial historian
on the place I least want to go to.

416
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,317
I mean, their state motto
runs through my head

417
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,071
like it's the Dow Jones ticker,
all day, every day.

418
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:48,408
It's, "Louisiana, where people smoke
in their cars with their babies." And...

419
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,661
[mumbling]

420
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:58,168
Arkansas's is,
"You done with that baby?" So...

421
00:22:58,251 --> 00:22:59,211
Hmm?

422
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,509
"What are you gonna do with it?"
"We're gonna eat it. What do you mean?

423
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,844
Sooey!"

424
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,762
Now...

425
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:17,813
I also got a lot of messages
from the Down syndrome community.

426
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,567
That was fun.

427
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,861
Here's the truth about that.

428
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,905
People with Down syndrome

429
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:31,660
write much more coherently
than people from Louisiana. So...

430
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,043
We were able to have a dialogue. [laughs]

431
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,632
And I think I've grown and matured
since then. I'm serious. I think I have.

432
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,510
I think, for instance, right now, today,

433
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:54,933
I think it is both lazy and antiquated
to say, "Are you fucking R-worded?"

434
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,478
R-E-T-A-R... You get it.

435
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,397
And here's why.

436
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,733
I think, when I say that, what I'm trying
to say is, "Are you an idiot?

437
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,069
Are you an imbecile? Are you stupid?"

438
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,155
And that is not the right word for that.

439
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,449
The right word for that is "Cajun."

440
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,534
So that's what I'm gonna start saying...

441
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,202
from now on.

442
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,288
So fuck you again.

443
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,914
That's my point. Now...

444
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,624
[crowd cheering, whistling]

445
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:20,542
Yeah.

446
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,049
But I'll tell you this.
I want you to know something.

447
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,051
I am not one of these comedians who goes,

448
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,347
"I don't understand
why people ever get upset about anything."

449
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,682
[gibbering]

450
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,436
Like the dumbest perspective you can have.

451
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,021
I totally understand.

452
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:46,401
I think you have a right to be offended
by whatever offends you,

453
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,529
and I think you have a right
to express it.

454
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,281
I do not think, however,

455
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:55,368
that you have a right
to expect anyone to do anything about it.

456
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,412
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah.

457
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,086
Just like if you express
any of your other feelings.

458
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:08,131
Like if you're like,
"I'm horny. I'm hungry. I'm tired."

459
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,383
I'd be like,
"Wow, you got a lot of shit going on.

460
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,347
Sounds like you need to jerk off,
eat a sandwich, and take a nap. And...

461
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:16,890
that's on you.

462
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,392
I mean, I'll give you a little tug
to get you started, but...

463
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,269
I'm not gonna finish."

464
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:26,358
And I also think I should have the right
to respond, you know?

465
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,692
Yeah, that's how it should work.

466
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,945
I say something, you say something,
I say something,

467
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,363
and it continues.

468
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:36,993
So I'll say this. I am not put out
by outraged culture, okay?

469
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
I'm serious. Doesn't affect me.

470
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:42,415
Because I deal with
emotionally fragile people every day.

471
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,876
See, I have two kids, and...

472
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,172
they bring me their problems.
They do. And I speak to them about them.

473
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,883
I speak to them differently
than I would normally speak to you.

474
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,887
You know, they'll come up to me,
and my older one will be like... [whining]

475
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,181
"It's loud...

476
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,101
over there."

477
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,312
And I'll be like... "Is it?

478
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,607
Well, then don't go over there."

479
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,571
He goes, "Okay."

480
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,073
And I go, "Okay."

481
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,035
And then I go, "Mwah,"
and I kiss him on the head.

482
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,162
And that's how I'm gonna start
speaking to adults

483
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,125
who tell me they're offended by jokes
during comedy shows. So...

484
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,459
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah.

485
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,674
The best part
is that you don't have to agree.

486
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,759
That's the great thing
about living in this country.

487
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,178
You don't have to agree,
but you'll know where I stand.

488
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,847
So if you come up to me, and you're like,

489
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,102
"I was deeply hurt by what you said
during your ha-ha show..."

490
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,439
I'll be like, "Oh, were you?

491
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,025
Well, you should never hear things 
you don't like,

492
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,860
so you stay home now. Mwah."

493
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,445
And I'll kiss you on the head.

494
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:03,538
That being said, do you ever wonder what
kind of slave owner you would have been?

495
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,497
Now...

496
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,626
Not now!

497
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:12,505
I mean, it's 1831, you're white,
you live...

498
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,466
exactly where you live right now.

499
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,724
You guys are like, "We don't want to play
this game." All right, well...

500
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,644
Fuck it, I'll play. Uh...

501
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,856
I know how I would have been.
I mean, I love buying cars now.

502
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,528
"I know we have three,
but look at this fucking guy!"

503
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,529
All right, well...

504
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,616
Hey, if you didn't like that joke...
[clicks tongue]

505
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,326
...don't think about it. Now...

506
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,372
Women. [laughs]

507
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,459
Do you feel like
you're almost equal citizens?

508
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,796
Because you are not. Now...

509
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,424
I'm on your side.

510
00:27:57,384 --> 00:28:01,262
I didn't say you shouldn't be.
I said you're not, because I have eyes.

511
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:06,267
You're not. You don't sense
the great imbalance that we live with?

512
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,813
Men get paid more
to do the same work that you do.

513
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,314
Advantage, men.

514
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,193
Women get mad at us
for things we do in their dreams.

515
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,611
Advantage, women.

516
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,864
Isn't that some shit?

517
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,369
When you're at breakfast and you're like,
"Why is she looking at me like that?"

518
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,625
She's like, "You were a dick
in my dream last night."

519
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,169
And you're like, "Okay, all right.

520
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,673
Are you serious?

521
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,719
I would like to apologize...

522
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,598
for what I did in your dream last night."

523
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,685
She's like, "Thank you."
And you're like,

524
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,645
"All right, I'm gonna get 
the fuck out of here."

525
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:55,066
See, I think the power dynamic
that we live with was set by a man.

526
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,067
Obviously.

527
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:58,862
I think he was gonna make it equal.
I really believe that.

528
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,197
And I think
the day he was going to set it up,

529
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:05,660
he was leaving his house, and his wife
stopped him at the door. And she was like,

530
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,164
"You know, you were titty fucking
a brunette in my dream last night."

531
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,250
And he was like, "You know what?

532
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,169
No.

533
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,839
You're gonna answer the phones.

534
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,091
That's what you're gonna do."
And he walked away.

535
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,801
[laughing] Okay.

536
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:26,181
Don't accurately joke about our culture.
All right.

537
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,352
[laughs] Really?

538
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,689
That's not funny either? You don't think 
there's a couple people in here

539
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,817
who are like, "I do answer the phones."
Like, is that funny to you?

540
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,155
[laughs] On Monday, she'll be like,
"Hi, thank you for...

541
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,157
Oh, fuck him. Fuck that guy." Right?

542
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,247
Sometimes, you witness the power imbalance
play out in front of you

543
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,501
between the genders
in a grotesque fashion.

544
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,669
Of course, when I say "the genders,"

545
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:00,882
I am only speaking of two
of the several hundred that now exist.

546
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,178
I would like it to be clear where I stand.

547
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,891
I have no problem calling anybody
anything they wish to be called.

548
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,935
It is no burden on me.

549
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,938
You can identify as a shoelace
if you want to.

550
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:19,025
And I will call you Zippedy Zim-zir
if you ask me to.

551
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:22,612
Do I think it's a little silly?

552
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,657
Yeah. But so is badminton,
and that's an Olympic event.

553
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,741
You know? So...

554
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:34,290
Here's what happened.
I was shooting a movie a few months back,

555
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,377
and one day, we wrapped up kind of early
from filmmaking.

556
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,753
It was late afternoon.

557
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,090
And I walk off set, and I notice
there's a bar across the street.

558
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,844
I go, "I'm gonna walk into this bar,
have a drink, go back to the hotel."

559
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,011
Simple enough, right?

560
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:51,099
I walk in,
I see a woman seated at the bar,

561
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:55,186
doing what I can only describe
as weird shit.

562
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,898
If you're like, "What do you mean, Tom?"

563
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:02,193
Well, I think
there's a normal spectrum of behavior

564
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,821
that you see from one seated at a bar.

565
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:07,991
You know, if you see them seated there,
you might see them go like this,

566
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:09,617
or, like, "Hey,"

567
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,785
or maybe even...

568
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,161
[imitating laughter]

569
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,000
This lady is seated at the bar,
and she's going...

570
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,217
I'm like, "Is she making fudge?
What is she doing over there?"

571
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,596
I also noticed it late.

572
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,724
Like, I noticed it as I'm walking past it.
That happens sometimes, right?

573
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,143
Like you walk,
you see something as you're passing it.

574
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,812
You're like, "That's some crazy shit,"
and you keep walking.

575
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,023
And then you're like,
"I need to see that again.

576
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,984
I don't know how I'm gonna see it again."

577
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,200
Now I'm dead center,

578
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:57,624
and I see that a woman, to be clear,
is in public, 4:30 in the afternoon,

579
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,918
and she is sitting there fucking...

580
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,632
Peeling her potato. I don't know. Um...

581
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,260
Playing with her pussy.
You know what I'm trying to say.

582
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,138
And she is not hot, if you're wondering.

583
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,934
If you're like, "Was she super hot?"

584
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,769
No, she wasn't.

585
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,980
And because of that,
I tattletaled immediately.

586
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,942
You know what's up. So...

587
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,363
I go to the bouncer. I go, "Excuse me.

588
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:33,076
That not-model over there...

589
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,038
is diddling herself at the bar."

590
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,792
And this big, yoked dude looked,
and he goes...

591
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,960
[babbling]

592
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,674
I go, "Yeah, talk to her." 
And he goes, "Mm-mm."

593
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,136
I'm like, "Excuse me?"

594
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,056
He goes, "I don't want
anything to do with that shit."

595
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,976
I'm like, "I don't think anybody does.

596
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,979
There's a woman masturbating at the bar."

597
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,772
He's like... [groans]

598
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:06,943
Like he's put out
by my outrageous request.

599
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,153
He's like, "All right, man, Jesus Christ."

600
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:14,117
So he gets up, he walks,
like, halfway there, turns around,

601
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,702
he goes, "Yeah, I couldn't do it, man."

602
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,789
I go, "You have to."

603
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,041
So he calls over the hostess.

604
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,086
This cute little 22-year-old
that's like, "What's up, guys?"

605
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,630
He goes, "Handle that."

606
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,673
She's like, "Okay."

607
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,886
She goes over there, super polite,
which is fucked up...

608
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,931
considering the circumstances.

609
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,892
I can't hear her,
but I can read her body language.

610
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:41,769
She's like, "Hi."

611
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,606
And she's like, "Everybody can see you."

612
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,404
And then she goes, "Stop it.

613
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,699
Stop."

614
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,201
And she goes, "You promise?" [laughs]

615
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,912
Then she goes, "Thank you."

616
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,541
And she comes back,
and she goes, "She's stopped."

617
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,836
I'm like, "She finished, or she stopped?"

618
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,715
She goes, "She stopped."

619
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,968
And I go. "Okay."
I'm like, "Wait, is she allowed to stay?"

620
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,887
And she goes, "Yeah."

621
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,222
I go, "Why?"

622
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,017
And she goes, "Because she stopped."

623
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,562
I go, "I'm sorry,
would I be allowed to stay...

624
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,400
if I was just sitting at your bar,
just kind of toying with the top?

625
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,359
You know, like...

626
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,912
Would you tap me on the shoulder
and be like, 'Excuse me.

627
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,999
Will you put your leaky dick
back in your pants?

628
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,420
Thanks. You want some chicken fingers
or a Sprite or something?'"

629
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:54,675
I say, "You'd call the SWAT team,
and they would rappel into the building.

630
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,471
Someone would crack my fucking head
on the side of the bar,

631
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,724
and you'd have a parade
as my corpse was carried out."

632
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,393
And she goes, "You're right about that."

633
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,857
[sighs] Maybe I'm overreacting. 
I don't know.

634
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:11,984
I don't jerk off in bars.

635
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,823
Years ago, I wouldn't find it necessary
to make that statement,

636
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:21,911
but in light of all the recent scandals,
I don't jerk off in bars. Now...

637
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,331
It's another reason
I stopped reading messages from people.

638
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:28,835
I keep getting messages all the time.
People were like, "Hi, big fan.

639
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,838
Uh, don't sexually assault anyone

640
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,215
so I can still be your fan."

641
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:35,967
Huh?

642
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,846
First of all, ride or die, bitch.

643
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,223
[crowd laughing, cheering]

644
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,141
Yeah.

645
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,941
I don't want no half-steppers in my crew.

646
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:52,859
Secondly...

647
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,321
what am I supposed to write back?
"Good looking out, bro.

648
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:03,077
I was about to
until I read your e-mail, Kyle."

649
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,330
Fuck you, Kyle.

650
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,919
You don't have to worry about me.
I don't jerk off in public. [laughs]

651
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,588
It's not what I'm into.

652
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,464
I'm into something else.

653
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,425
Here's what it is.

654
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,342
Uh...

655
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,220
[laughs]

656
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:23,264
-You guys are like, "Okay..."
-[woman] Yeah!

657
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,599
-All right, yeah.
-[woman] Yeah!

658
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,893
If you ever want to hear me masturbate...

659
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,647
all you have to do is call me and tell me

660
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,358
you can't make it to our dinner plans.

661
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,987
I'll start stroking right then and there.

662
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,366
I am not social. I fucking love that call.

663
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,744
That is my favorite call. I lo--

664
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,996
Especially if it's
as I'm leaving the house,

665
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,123
I'm gonna have multiple orgasms, okay?

666
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,834
When I'm walking out of the house, 
and I'm like,

667
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,544
"I don't want to fucking
go out with them,"

668
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,755
and then they call and they're like,
"We can't make it,"

669
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,757
I'm like, "Keep talking.

670
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,636
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why?"

671
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,847
"Well, we were in a car accident."

672
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,890
I'm like, "Oh.

673
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,518
Are you okay?

674
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:13,064
You are, but you're still not coming 
to dinner. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."

675
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,110
"All right, clean it up, Tom."
You got it. So...

676
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,821
So I'm a dad. [snickering]

677
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:21,781
And, uh...

678
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,994
I, um... I've changed some.

679
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,872
Not too much.
You have to change a little bit.

680
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,750
You know, there's an expression,
"Having kids changes you."

681
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,127
I think...
Personally, I think it should be modified

682
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,505
to, "Having kids should change you."

683
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,133
It's a big-time red flag
when you meet somebody who's like,

684
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,219
"Yeah, I've had four kids.
I haven't changed at all."

685
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,805
You're like, "You're super unstable.
That's good to know."

686
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,182
They don't have to be huge changes.

687
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,477
But, you know,
you kind of evaluate your life

688
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,895
and you make a change.

689
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,690
Me, personally,
I'm very proud of what I changed.

690
00:37:55,773 --> 00:38:00,027
I realized when I had kids,
I had no time, no energy.

691
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,239
I need to edit something out of my life.
You know what I edited out of my life?

692
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,116
Arguing with everyone.

693
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,160
Every friend, every family member.
I just don't engage.

694
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,830
As soon as it starts,
I flip it on them, okay?

695
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,373
As soon as I'm arguing with somebody,

696
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,583
and they're like,
"Yeah, I don't really agree with you,"

697
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,294
I go, "Yep. I'm on your side now."

698
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,546
They're like, "What?"

699
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,008
I go, "As soon as you spoke,
I came around and joined you.

700
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,927
That's how little I want to talk to you."

701
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,389
And I'm free. It feels great. Now...

702
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,644
Not everybody likes it.
I'll tell you, my own mother is not a fan.

703
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,645
[laughs]

704
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,605
She lives for arguing.

705
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,774
There are some people built like that.

706
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,985
She lives for, you know, combative things.

707
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:44,697
She wants to just fucking stab
and twist, turn. She loves it.

708
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,326
She's also a dream crusher, which is...

709
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:52,204
my least favorite quality
in a human being.

710
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,372
You know a dream crusher?

711
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:58,336
The person who, no matter what you say
you want to do or try, they're like,

712
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,337
"Mm-mm.

713
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,047
Not you."

714
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,549
And you're like,
"It's good to have you around," you know?

715
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,801
Those stay with you. Right?

716
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:09,138
I bet you me just bringing it up
brings them to your own memory.

717
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,390
That's how powerful they are.
I remember...

718
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,976
I do remember telling her,
"I'm going to LA to do stand-up."

719
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,146
This is years ago. I say it to her.
"I'm going to LA to do stand-up."

720
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:20,941
Her response was... [in Spanish accent]
"You should go to the post office."

721
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,448
I was so naive. I was like, "They do 
stand-up shows at the post office?"

722
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,992
She goes... 
[in Spanish accent] "No, to work."

723
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,495
I was like,
"Oh, no, stand-up would be the work."

724
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,622
And she goes... 
[in Spanish accent] "I understand."

725
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,375
I was like, "Wait a minute.
Am I telling you my dream,

726
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,752
and then you're saying, 
'Go be a mailman'?"

727
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,338
And she was like... 
[in Spanish accent] "Yes."

728
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,340
Okay. Now I do all right.

729
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,384
You know, I make a good living.
She knows about it.

730
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,303
Obviously. She hits me up for shit
constantly, but...

731
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,680
I still get to have some fun.

732
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,892
Like, do you know what I sent my mother
just a few weeks ago

733
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,061
for her 75th birthday?

734
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,147
A book of fucking stamps. And...

735
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,527
I put a little note in there.
"I got these at work today."

736
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,653
[imitating laughter]

737
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,071
-Like that.
-[crowd cheers]

738
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:07,988
Yeah.

739
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,454
Don't feel badly.
She gets hooked up. So...

740
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,457
Yeah, she's such a dick, but...

741
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,585
[laughing] She is.

742
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,963
I don't like that dream-crushing shit.
I really don't.

743
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,089
I'm the opposite.

744
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,841
I'm a dream encourager.

745
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:31,262
If you come to me with a crazy idea,
then I'll really celebrate, okay?

746
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:35,224
I love people
who have just outrageous dreams.

747
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,935
I've put that out there now.
Now people walk up to me all the time,

748
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,147
like, "I want to open a hot dog stand
where you can buy boots."

749
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,357
I'm like,
"All right, let's figure it out."

750
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,863
I like it, and I'll tell you this,
I want you to have crazy dreams.

751
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,448
I'm serious. I really do.

752
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,826
I'll give you the best advice, sincerely,
not a joke,

753
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,036
that I ever got about pursuing a dream.

754
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,372
And I hope it applies to all of you, okay?

755
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,083
Here's the truth. I think-- This is true.

756
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:07,173
As long as you accept that your dream
might not go exactly as you plan,

757
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,718
you will still feel fulfilled
by the pursuit of your dream.

758
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,720
So always go after
whatever you want to do.

759
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,222
Otherwise, what's the point in living,
right?

760
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,140
Yeah.

761
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,522
Now, to further that point,
I'll tell you this.

762
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:26,442
I remember, two years ago,
I'm sitting at a café

763
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,068
in Los Angeles for lunch.

764
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,153
I sit down.

765
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,321
As I sit down,

766
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:33,532
my friend, I can hear her audibly say,
"I can't believe I'm thinking that."

767
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,076
And I go, "Thinking what?"
And she goes, "Oh, nothing."

768
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,078
I go, "What is it?"
She goes, "It's embarrassing."

769
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,749
And I go, "Just tell me." She goes,
"If I tell you, you'll make fun of me."

770
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,876
And I go,
"I always make fun of you. Just say it."

771
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,504
She goes, "It's just something
I want to keep inside."

772
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,507
I go, "You said you want to do it.
So say it, then you can make it happen."

773
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,510
She goes, "I don't want to." I go,
"If you don't put it out in the universe,

774
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,845
it'll never happen.
You've gotta say it. What is it?"

775
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,096
And she goes, "Okay.

776
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,891
I want to blow somebody
in the Wu-Tang Clan."

777
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:08,609
Now, I immediately think...

778
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,195
"What would my mom say?" You know?

779
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,989
And I tell myself, "Don't be like Mom.

780
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,408
This is this girl's dream."

781
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,874
So I look her dead in her eyes...

782
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,293
and I go, "You should try.

783
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,215
There's a bunch of them."
That's what I said. Now...

784
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:36,262
Three months later...

785
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,931
she got on their tour bus...

786
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:42,101
and she told them, and guess what?

787
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,603
They all accepted.

788
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,360
If you are not familiar,

789
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,154
there are nine guys...

790
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,490
in the Wu-Tang Clan.

791
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,616
Nine.

792
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,577
[laughing] So many guys.

793
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,288
That's so many--

794
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,582
Can we park for a moment...

795
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,084
at how many dicks nine is?

796
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,880
I don't even understand how anyone's
sitting in their seat right now.

797
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:16,218
There's people out here like, "Hmm, 
what else you got?" Are you shitting me?

798
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,596
That's not a lot?

799
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,638
Close your eyes...

800
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,933
and picture nine dicks.

801
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,603
You're like, "God, they're everywhere."

802
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,605
Yeah, 'cause there's nine of them. 
That's why.

803
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,609
I'm not slut-shaming.

804
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:36,196
I'm saying, objectively,
nine is a lot of anything.

805
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:39,992
Like, if I was like,
"I had cinnamon rolls today."

806
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,203
And you're like, "How many did you have?"

807
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,372
"I had nine."

808
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,256
"You need me to take you
to the emergency room or...?

809
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:58,218
You're gonna lose a foot by the morning.
We should go."

810
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,346
Nine dicks?

811
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,264
Are you fucking shitting me?

812
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:06,101
Some of you,
it took you 15 years to get to nine dicks.

813
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,312
This was a Thursday for this young lady.

814
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,569
Try to imagine

815
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,614
the physical labor involved...

816
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,786
with blowing nine
probably not small dicks.

817
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,085
If you're not aware, the Wu-Tang fellas
don't look like me, all right?

818
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,173
That is some CrossFit shit at that level.

819
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,134
If you think burpees are rough, try...

820
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,263
"Am I doing good?

821
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,558
Do you like me now?"

822
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,357
After how many do you think she was like,
"Let's take a little break for a second.

823
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,902
[whimpering]

824
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,114
What the fuck am I doing?

825
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,077
Why are they so mean about it?
[laughs]

826
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,289
How many is that?

827
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,708
Four! Fuck!

828
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,545
Am I done?"

829
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,672
And they're like, "No, you're not done!

830
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,426
U-God, RZA, Rae, Ghost, Meth.
No, you're not done!"

831
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,933
She's like, "But my neck hurts."

832
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,729
And they're like, "You've got to protect
ya neck. Don't you listen to our music?"

833
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,480
[crowd cheering]

834
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,696
Yes. Yes.

835
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,241
That is a top-shelf Wu-Tang blowjob joke.
Now...

836
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,786
[sighs] She was a real animal, you know.

837
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,165
I asked her one time, I was like,
"If you could go back to that day

838
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,959
and do anything differently,
what would you have done?"

839
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,670
And she said, "I'd have skipped lunch."
So...

840
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,088
[crowd groaning, laughing]

841
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,089
Yeah.

842
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,469
Philly girl, what are you gonna do?
Now...

843
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,763
[laughs]

844
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,266
What were we talking about before?
Oh, yeah, my mom. So...

845
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,771
[laughs] Here's how 
I stopped arguing with her.

846
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:17,399
I hope, if you're in a similar situation
with a parent,

847
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,610
you have an epiphany the way I did.

848
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,863
Here's the circumstance, right?
She calls me, late last year.

849
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:26,033
There were fires in LA. And she goes... 
[in Spanish accent] "Tommy..."

850
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,410
She's not local, if you don't know yet.

851
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,331
If you're like, "Why does she 
talk so fucking weird?" Uh...

852
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:33,957
She's from South America.

853
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,626
Peru, to be specific. Okay.

854
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,835
[crowd cheers]

855
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,088
So she calls me, and she goes, "Tommy..."

856
00:46:40,172 --> 00:46:43,592
And I go, "Yeah?" 
She goes, "The fires, they are bad?"

857
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,968
And I go, "Yeah.

858
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:49,014
Usually they're good,
but this is a bad one."

859
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,103
And she goes, "People are dying?"

860
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,022
I go, "If they're in the fire, yeah.

861
00:46:58,524 --> 00:46:59,358
It's fire."

862
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,611
And she lives in Florida, so she goes,

863
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:06,073
"You have fires, we have hurricanes.

864
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,910
People are dying everywhere."

865
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,120
And I go, "Sounds like 
you have the news on.

866
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,997
Is there anything else 
you want to report?"

867
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,001
And she goes,
"I think it's happening for a reason."

868
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,671
And I go,
"It is. They're called weather patterns."

869
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:22,589
And she goes, "No.

870
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:26,468
I think God is trying to send us...

871
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,011
a message."

872
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:31,431
That's what I do. I go... [laughs]

873
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,059
I go, "What's the message?"

874
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:37,938
She goes, "I think he's trying to tell us
to be better people."

875
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,527
You know when somebody says something,
and you can feel with certainty

876
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,362
that you're gonna argue with them?

877
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:48,866
Like, as words leave their lips,

878
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,118
you're like,
"I'm gonna light you up pretty hard."

879
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:57,457
I could feel seething anger growing,

880
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,712
and I could hear my own argument
in my head. I could hear my own voice say,

881
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:06,800
"You mean to tell me that our all-knowing
and all-loving and all-present God

882
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,177
is setting people on fire...

883
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:13,307
and drowning them in hurricanes
so that we hug more?

884
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,560
This is the stupidest shit
I have ever heard in my entire life."

885
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,645
[crowd cheering, applauding]

886
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,733
But...

887
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,944
right before I said it, I had that moment.

888
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,530
I had that thought where I go,
"What is the point?

889
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:31,158
Why argue with this demon woman?"

890
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,075
You know?

891
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:36,038
"Just let Lucifer's sister have her way.

892
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,249
You're not gonna change her mind."

893
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,169
So, for the first time in my life,
I took a deep breath,

894
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,171
and I just went, "Yeah.

895
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,257
I can see why he would do that.

896
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,344
[sighs] Hope he stops killing us."

897
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:51,637
[forced laughter]

898
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,598
And she knew. She goes, "What?"

899
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,104
I go, "You make a good point,"
and she goes, "Why are you doing this?"

900
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,693
Why are you...
Meaning, "Why aren't you arguing with me?"

901
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:11,323
I go, "Mom, I don't know. Who cares?
You're right. I'm wrong. So what?"

902
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,617
And she goes, "Tommy, do you know what?"

903
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,868
I go, "What?"

904
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:17,788
She goes, "I always knew
you were a little bitch, Tommy."

905
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:23,460
And I go, "What?"

906
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:26,922
And she goes, "Chao, puto,"
and she hung up the phone.

907
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,679
That's my mother.

908
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:37,933
Okay, here's how I got her back.
It's pretty fun. Uh...

909
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,893
I never curse her out.

910
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,312
As much as I say crazy things,
I never curse...

911
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,732
Even if I'm really mad, I can't do like,
"Fuck you!" I can't do it.

912
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,070
It doesn't sit right.
I prefer psychological warfare, you know?

913
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,116
Yeah. I like knowing
that I can ask my mother a question,

914
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,743
and the mere mention of that question

915
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,788
might terrorize her mind
for years to come.

916
00:50:00,622 --> 00:50:03,792
So I decided I would ruin one of her days.

917
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,043
So I chose Christmas.

918
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,503
So here's what I did, okay?

919
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,839
[laughing]

920
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:15,846
Christmas morning, my parents
and their five dogs are at my house.

921
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,266
My mother is in a fantastic mood, okay?

922
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,894
She is a Latina woman
on Christmas morning.

923
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,440
You don't understand
this type of joy, all right?

924
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,316
She's, like, cooking and dancing.
She's like...

925
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,402
[vocalizing]

926
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,989
♪ Baby Jesús is here today ♪

927
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,534
Just doing her spic shit, you know, so...

928
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,372
It's my mom.

929
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,331
Okay, so...

930
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:45,834
I see her.

931
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,336
[laughing]

932
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:53,133
Yeah. I go, "Mom."

933
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,260
And she goes, "Yes?"

934
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,222
Like, I could feel the joy coming off her,

935
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,224
and I'm like, "Now's a good time."

936
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,895
I go, "Mom, have you ever thought about

937
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,647
how you're gonna have to bury
each one of those dogs?"

938
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,483
[crowd gasps]

939
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,154
She goes, "Why would you say that?"

940
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,199
And I go, "I don't know."

941
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,411
I go, "Do you ever think about

942
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:25,165
-what you'll do if Dad dies before you?"
-[woman] Oh, my God!

943
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,878
She goes... [tearfully] "No.

944
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,255
I've never thought about this."

945
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,133
And I go, "Well, I'm asking you, so...

946
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,551
think about it."

947
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,305
And she goes, "I will pray...

948
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,059
and I will hope to die the same day."

949
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,770
I go,
"That'd actually be super convenient.

950
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:48,021
Like as far as...

951
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,149
planning the funerals
and going over the wills.

952
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,902
If you can pull it off,
I think we'd all be on board."

953
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,073
She goes... 
[sobbing] "Merry Christmas, Tom."

954
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,536
I go, "Merry Christmas to you too." And...

955
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,539
my dad is sitting two feet away.

956
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,209
He hasn't heard
one word of the conversation.

957
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,213
He's just in dad mode, checked out,
staring at ceiling lights.

958
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,172
You know, like...

959
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,846
You call his attention,
it just snaps him out of a flashback.

960
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,430
I'm like, "Hey, Dad--" "Yeah!"

961
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,766
Jesus.

962
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,772
I asked him the same thing.

963
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,690
I go, "Hey, man,

964
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,193
have you ever thought about what you'd do
if Mom dies before you?"

965
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,946
He goes, "I like blondes,
and I like big tits, buddy."

966
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:46,496
"Sounds like you've been
thinking about that quite a bit."

967
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,957
And he goes, "Every night, pal.

968
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:50,458
Every night."

969
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:53,920
I'm just like... [laughs]
"You guys have different dreams, I guess."

970
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,006
That guy. Oh, my God.

971
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,384
Nothing like men in their 70s, right? 
[groans]

972
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:02,762
My dad's at that really cool place
in his life

973
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,767
where he says things that are true
that provide relief to no one.

974
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:12,731
Like, this week I call him up,
and I'm like, "What's up?"

975
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:15,775
He goes, "You know, gays don't bother me."
And I was like...

976
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:18,278
"That's good."

977
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,115
He goes, "They're just living their life.
Why would I get upset?"

978
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,700
And I'm like, "I don't know."

979
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:31,208
And then it's just quiet on the phone.
I'm like, "Are we done talking right now?"

980
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:36,296
He's like, "No, I'm just thinking."
"Oh, it's fun to listen to...

981
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,341
as you breathe into the..."

982
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,800
[breathing heavily]

983
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,721
And he goes,
"Your mother and I are going on a cruise."

984
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,389
And I go, "Okay, have fun."

985
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,018
And I ask him, I go, "Which cruise line?"
And he goes, "Carnival."

986
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,938
And I'm like, "Wait,
isn't that, like, the party cruise?"

987
00:53:53,146 --> 00:53:54,564
And my dad's response...

988
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:57,901
I swear on my children...

989
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,819
was, "Buddy,

990
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,571
there's no other way to say it.

991
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:04,741
I love watching black people have fun."

992
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:11,873
What?

993
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,671
I mean, we all do, but to say it out loud?

994
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:19,965
It's fucking crazy.

995
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:26,680
Can you picture my dad on the aftdeck
of a Carnival cruise, just like...

996
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:35,188
"Those blacks are having fun.
Let's get some food. This is fun."

997
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,857
[laughs]

998
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,111
All right, let's get serious.

999
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:45,156
Guys, I think it's time

1000
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,451
we have to start taking better care
of the environment.

1001
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,495
All right? Yeah.

1002
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:51,496
[crowd cheering]

1003
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:52,414
Absolutely.

1004
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:57,669
And I think that responsibility
falls on the poor. And here's why.

1005
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,547
You're already in my trash.

1006
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,924
How about you separate
the glass from the plastic?

1007
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,427
[crowd laughing, whistling]

1008
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,469
Yeah.

1009
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,556
It sounds like there's some poor people
over here.

1010
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,642
And that's fucking disgusting. Now...

1011
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,563
Here's what I know for sure.

1012
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:19,190
Poor people love the Bible, okay?

1013
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,570
And they love it
because it's the only book

1014
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,155
you get for free. Now...

1015
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,702
Try getting another book for free.

1016
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,871
Let me know how that shit goes.

1017
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,374
Can you imagine being so dumb...

1018
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,008
that you're superstitious?

1019
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,348
Imagine being so impossibly stupid.

1020
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:56,561
Personally, I have nothing but contempt
for all superstitions

1021
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,396
and all superstitious people.

1022
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,481
I hate all of them.

1023
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:02,400
I hate riding in the car with someone
who's like,

1024
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,694
"We're about to drive over a bridge."

1025
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,363
[gasps, grunting]

1026
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,703
Like, "I'm gonna get out of the car,
and I hope you drive off this bridge.

1027
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:14,621
I really do."

1028
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:18,666
They're all dumb. "It's 11:11."

1029
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:19,959
[imitating laughter]

1030
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,420
"Make a wish."

1031
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,174
I wish you would drink
a smoothie of cyanide and broken rocks.

1032
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:27,217
That's what I wish.

1033
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,262
They should all upset you,

1034
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:34,391
but there's one that should make you
march in the streets. I'm serious.

1035
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,559
I cannot believe that we live

1036
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:40,271
in this incredibly wealthy,
developed nation,

1037
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:43,233
and, collectively, we all just accept

1038
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:48,988
that hotels, even some office buildings,
just don't have to have a 13th floor.

1039
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,990
Like, do you understand...

1040
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,661
that we're throwing away
sequential numbers

1041
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,414
because people are like... [muttering]

1042
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,877
You can go to a nice hotel,
the fucking Four Seasons,

1043
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,797
it'll go 12th floor, 14th floor.

1044
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,842
And if you go, "I'm sorry,
why isn't there a 13th floor?"

1045
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,844
"Well, that's a spooky number.

1046
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:17,559
And if we had it,
there'd be ghosts and goblins up there.

1047
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,356
So we took it away,

1048
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,650
and now it's not so scary."

1049
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:28,903
And you're like, "Are you fucking Cajun?

1050
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,114
Is that really what we're doing
right now?"

1051
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,740
[crowd cheering]

1052
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,367
I don't know.

1053
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,119
Yeah.

1054
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,581
You guys like that one,
but that Bible one...

1055
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:40,582
[grunts]

1056
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,878
You pulled back on that.
You guys were like... [grunting]

1057
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,551
"He listens to every show."

1058
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,927
[shushing]

1059
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,098
It's cool.
I talked to him before the show.

1060
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,642
He said it was a good angle.
Don't worry about it. Now...

1061
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:02,020
[laughing]

1062
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,234
I'm not calling you stupid
if you're religious, okay?

1063
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:09,194
That's a cheap shot.

1064
00:58:09,277 --> 00:58:11,905
If religion gives you comfort,
I think that's great.

1065
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,865
I would not call you stupid for that.

1066
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,910
I would only call you stupid
if you read your horoscope.

1067
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,536
[laughs] And, uh...

1068
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:25,502
you make life decisions based on...

1069
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,003
[gibbering]

1070
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,757
...what the planets are doing. [laughs]

1071
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:35,136
I don't know if you've ever spent time
with one of these non-contributors, but...

1072
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,181
they're usually sharing their wisdom,

1073
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:41,017
like, "You've got to go for it,
'cause you're a Pisces."

1074
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,227
[gibbering]

1075
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,355
Thanks, Doc.

1076
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,441
Those are the same people
that think it's a miracle

1077
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:50,527
to share a birthday with someone.

1078
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,695
Like that's a noteworthy event.

1079
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,949
And then you get to explain
how that's not weird.

1080
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:58,201
"Well, there's a lot of us and...

1081
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,913
not that many options.
It's gonna happen all the time."

1082
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,415
Those people... [groans]

1083
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:09,629
But the ones who make me
immediately homicidal are...

1084
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:14,759
people who get excited
about a close-to-each-other birthday.

1085
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,972
As if that is worth wasting a breath on.

1086
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,891
I get this in hotels once a month.

1087
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,393
I check into a hotel,

1088
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,687
the guy will take my ID,
and he'll be like...

1089
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:26,896
[chuckling]

1090
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,315
"You're April 16th?

1091
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:30,900
I'm April 3rd."

1092
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:40,660
I go, "Hold on a second!

1093
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,289
You mean to tell me...

1094
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,041
two weeks...

1095
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,335
before I was born...

1096
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:51,337
you were born?

1097
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:55,675
-[moans]
-[crowd cheering, screaming]

1098
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,179
[man howls]

1099
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,432
-[crowd whistling]
-[grunting]

1100
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:10,440
Yeah. I've got panty pudding now."

1101
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,819
Panty pudding?

1102
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,696
[groaning]

1103
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:17,739
Gross.

1104
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,409
I remember the girl who said it. It was...

1105
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:24,329
2002 and...

1106
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,165
a lot of you will not like this.

1107
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,172
But that year, Ohio State won
the national championship in football.

1108
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,965
[crowd cheering, booing]

1109
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:41,387
Whoa. It's almost like you care more
about football than the Bible.

1110
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:42,388
But anyway...

1111
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:44,724
[crowd cheering, applauding]

1112
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,227
I know.

1113
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,188
Boo, history. Anyway...

1114
01:00:51,272 --> 01:00:52,398
I was with this girl.

1115
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,359
I met her the day after the game.

1116
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,320
She was from Columbus,
where the school is located.

1117
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,530
I said something casually. I just said it.

1118
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:03,576
I was like, "Oh, you're from Columbus?
You guys won the title. Are you excited?"

1119
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,914
And she goes, "Excited?
I've got panty pudding."

1120
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,375
And I was like...

1121
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,668
[groans]

1122
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,255
And then I fucked her because...

1123
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,592
she was a dirty girl, all right?

1124
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,761
And she was not lying.

1125
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,472
That shit was like tapioca.
You had to scoop it out.

1126
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,766
Over your shoulder.

1127
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:30,770
Do you think Cosby still eats pudding?

1128
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:40,947
I often wonder if he has maintained
his sense of humor on the inside.

1129
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,784
Do you think he teases the fellas
on the way to the shower?

1130
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:49,288
Do you think he's like, "Hey, don't put
your pudding pop in my raisin cake."

1131
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:56,212
Like that?

1132
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:03,386
And they're like,
"Man, Bill's crazy as shit, huh?

1133
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,472
Let me get a cigarette, Bill!"
All right, so...

1134
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,433
[laughs]

1135
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,602
You can tell I like you.

1136
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:14,105
Yeah. You know why?

1137
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,858
'Cause I told you an old sex story
from my life.

1138
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,901
I think, 100% of the time
when that happens,

1139
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:22,363
when somebody tells you an old story
like that from their life,

1140
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,158
it's because they like you
and they seek your approval.

1141
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,410
-[crowd cheering]
-Yeah. Absolutely. Dude...

1142
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,455
Who tells you the best stories?

1143
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,790
It's always people newish to your life.

1144
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:35,585
Why? Because they're giving you
the best they've got.

1145
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,170
They want to impress you.

1146
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:40,590
Who tells you the worst stories?
Your best friends.

1147
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,844
They know you're not going anywhere.
Your best friends are like,

1148
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,388
"I fucked my wife,"
and you're like, "Shut up.

1149
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,851
We're about to eat. I know her.
Shut the fuck up, man."

1150
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,353
Then they're like, "It's a good story."

1151
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,731
"Okay, what?"
"Well, she didn't really want to do it."

1152
01:02:57,732 --> 01:03:00,985
[sighs] "But I kept bothering her
and bothering her.

1153
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,696
And she finally broke down.

1154
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:06,032
She really just laid still."

1155
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:08,868
You're like, "What are you? Ted Bundy?
This is a terrible story."

1156
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:12,872
I'll tell you a fun story, all right?

1157
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:17,627
When I first got to LA, many years ago,
I met a girl in a bar.

1158
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:19,253
She took me back to her place.

1159
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:22,089
We started messing around.
I signed the consent forms.

1160
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,884
We start messing around.

1161
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,762
As we're doing it, she reaches around,

1162
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,931
she puts a finger in me, and I go...

1163
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:30,932
[gasps]

1164
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,684
And she goes, "Mmm?"

1165
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,813
And I go, "Oh, yeah."

1166
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,276
That's it. That's the end of the story.
Right.

1167
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,532
Go for your dreams. [laughs]

1168
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:52,495
I do mean that. I know it sounds cheesy,
but I don't mean it to. I just...

1169
01:03:52,578 --> 01:03:53,996
Here's why I think about it so much.

1170
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,083
I meet so many people. Okay?
I meet way more people than you.

1171
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,459
Um...

1172
01:03:58,751 --> 01:04:00,127
It's not even close. So...

1173
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,297
Here's the thing.
People usually say nice things to me.

1174
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,633
They're like, "Thanks for coming.
I had a good time."

1175
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:09,595
Conversations naturally will turn,
and I'll ask somebody, "What do you do?"

1176
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,639
Do you know what I hear
like 98% of the time?

1177
01:04:11,722 --> 01:04:14,058
They'll be like,
"It fucking sucks. I hate it."

1178
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:16,352
Then I go,
"Why don't you do something else?"

1179
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:19,689
They go, "It's too late. My life's fucked.
Good to meet you, man" and they walk away.

1180
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:21,858
Yeah, that sits in my head.

1181
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:23,442
So I think about it.

1182
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,863
But I have advice. This is the advice
that I hope you'll leave with, all right?

1183
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:30,157
This is it. You just need to learn
to do one thing really well.

1184
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,075
And it's this.

1185
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:34,412
You need to learn
to manage your expectations.

1186
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:37,290
It's not an innate thing you're born with.
It's a skill.

1187
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,542
If you work at it, you'll get good at it.

1188
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:43,254
The more you manage your expectations,
you'll feel more fulfilled,

1189
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,923
less depressed, happier overall.

1190
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,218
I'll share with you
my life's greatest disappointment,

1191
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:51,345
which, in retrospect, is my fault.

1192
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,389
I didn't know it at the time. I do now.

1193
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:56,267
And I'm gonna tell you
it's gonna be upsetting to some people.

1194
01:04:56,851 --> 01:05:00,354
But hopefully, we can use it
as a learning tool, so...

1195
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,232
Here's what it is, all right? [groans]

1196
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:07,945
I think that sixty-nining is overrated,
and it sucks.

1197
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,072
[crowd cheering, applauding]

1198
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,992
Yeah. Yeah, you see that? 
Some people clap.

1199
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,661
Some people are like, "Arrest this man."
But listen.

1200
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:19,123
The story of why is more important.

1201
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,334
Do you remember
when you first heard about it? I do.

1202
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,170
I was in third grade.
And that's too young. All right?

1203
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,965
One of the older kids told me,
and I was like, "What?

1204
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:30,676
At the same time?"

1205
01:05:32,303 --> 01:05:34,847
I almost had a seizure.
I didn't know what he was saying.

1206
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:38,184
I didn't even have references
so I could pretend like I understood.

1207
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:41,187
I was like, "That's like eating
a cheeseburger covered in ice cream

1208
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,356
while you're taking a shit or something."

1209
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,526
And he was like,
"That's exactly what it's like."

1210
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,363
From that day on, I was hooked.

1211
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,408
When I tell you I was obsessed,
I was obsessed.

1212
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,202
I'm not saying it for a story.

1213
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,913
It is all I talked about, thought about,
dreamt about,

1214
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,499
sung about, joked about, 
"Sixty-nine, sixty-nine, sixty-nine..."

1215
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,669
Every notebook in school, I was like, 
"Sixty-nine, sixty-nine, sixty-nine..."

1216
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:07,630
Every sports team I was on,
I was like, "I'm number 69!"

1217
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,883
They were like,
"This is fifth grade basketball.

1218
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,593
Why don't you chill out, buddy?"

1219
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,180
Every birthday, Christmas,
my dad'd go, "What do you want?"

1220
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:19,767
I'd go, "I want a sixty-nine."
He'd go, "Shut up and stop saying that!"

1221
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:22,144
And I was like, "No!" Defiant. "No!"

1222
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,107
"Sixty-nine, sixty-nine. It's gonna be 
the best. Be the best. Sixty-nine.

1223
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:29,276
It'll be like smoking meth
out of God's dick. I want to do it."

1224
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,531
And I built it up, and I built it up, 
and I built it up,

1225
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,492
and when I finally got to do it,
I finally got to do it,

1226
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:39,787
you know what the first thing I said was?
"Get off me. All right?"

1227
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:41,998
My neck hurts.

1228
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,417
I can't get my nose out of the way.

1229
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,837
Does it feel good?
It feels like I'm working.

1230
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,340
All right, it'd feel better
if you flipped over and polished me off,

1231
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:52,675
and then I'll do you.

1232
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:55,428
Why's it got to be at the same time?

1233
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,304
Are we late for something?

1234
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:02,935
Uh...

1235
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,940
Is the youth pastor coming back
in a few minutes?

1236
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:13,362
Let's take turns,
like we learned in kindergarten.

1237
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:17,199
What type of maniac sixty-nines
as an adult?

1238
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,492
I mean, if you're a guy,

1239
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:20,911
I hope you're at least
a gentleman about it

1240
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,371
and you lay on your back

1241
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:26,500
and you're not one of these savage
fucking pigs...

1242
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,005
who's like, "I prefer this angle.

1243
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:35,468
And then you can hear the fight to live
underneath you."

1244
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,513
[gagging]

1245
01:07:40,514 --> 01:07:44,185
And you're like, "Yeah, that feels good."
I bet it fucking does feel good.

1246
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:47,938
As you're throating that poor lady
underneath you.

1247
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:52,276
I don't think there's
a more horrific picture I can paint...

1248
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:56,197
than that of a woman, a lovely woman...

1249
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,325
Like, picture your mom
laying on her back...

1250
01:08:00,826 --> 01:08:04,622
in anticipation of sixty-nining
from the bottom.

1251
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:07,500
And she's like, "What the fuck?"

1252
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,503
And she's got that look on her face,

1253
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:13,506
like, "Is the search party
gonna find me here?"

1254
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:17,093
And then a man, a disgusting man...

1255
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:21,889
like me, is like,
"Well, saddle up. Here we go."

1256
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:25,976
There's dingleberries and lint.

1257
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,939
And here's your mom, and I'm like...
[grunting]

1258
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,148
[laughs]

1259
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:34,693
And then, if I do that,
I hear, "What's on my forehead?"

1260
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,030
And I'm like, "That's my gut.

1261
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,115
[laughs]

1262
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,493
That's Daddy's wet trash bag gut."

1263
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:45,996
Austin, you were a blast.
Thanks for coming out tonight.

1264
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,332
-Appreciate it very much.
-[crowd cheering]

1265
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,793
See you next time. Good night.
See you, buddy.
