1
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,635
Thank you.

2
00:00:53,886 --> 00:00:54,887
Man!

3
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,184
Let's talk about the phenomenon
that is Donald Trump.

4
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:04,898
People angry already.
"What? I'll kill you!"

5
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:08,610
"Donald Trump, okay?
Donald Trump, all right?"

6
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,821
I do him a little effeminate.
I don't know why.

7
00:01:11,904 --> 00:01:13,281
I just do him, like, a little soft,

8
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:18,328
little bit of lotion, little bit
of ChapStick. I just do, you know.

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,913
I mean, he's got his patented moves.
You know, he's got the seal.

10
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,082
That's one of his, the seal.

11
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,334
"Okay, okay, okay, okay."

12
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,216
The index shuffle.
"Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

13
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,176
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay."

14
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,222
He's like a Batman villain
if you think about it, isn't he?

15
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,432
"You'll never get away with this, Trump."

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,269
"You know... I think I will, okay?"

17
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:57,159
The thing of 2016 was that he
took out Jeb Bush. He took him out.

18
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,620
The Bushes, they're tough, man.
They're like the "Sons of Katie Elder."

19
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,788
Boomer reference.

20
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:05,708
They're pissed, you know,
'cause Trump took him down so fast.

21
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,003
He just went, "You know,
you know, you know, Jeb,

22
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,131
you're a low-energy individual, okay?

23
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:16,511
You're very tired. You're very tired.
You're very, very tired.

24
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:23,810
You're tired... tired... tired."

25
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,147
And I looked at Jeb Bush,
and I thought, "My God, he's right!"

26
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,151
He looks like a vice principal
of a junior high school.

27
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,540
'Cause Bush family...
But you gotta admit how fun to put W,

28
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,042
not Jeb but W, up against Trump.

29
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:51,171
'Cause W... W is like...
He's kinda like a street fighter.

30
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,047
He's kinda...

31
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,842
You know, he's kinda just itchy
and kinda jumpy.

32
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,179
Yeah.

33
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,933
He's the only president who was, like,
surfing and hitchhiking the entire time.

34
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,525
I would love to see him up against Trump,
'cause Trump would be like,

35
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,612
"You know, you're president because
your daddy was president. That's it.

36
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,405
Okay? Okay? Okay?"

37
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:20,491
W would be like... "Yeah.

38
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,663
Who does your hair? Stupidcuts?

39
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,132
'Cause that thing is hair-diculous."

40
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,975
An impression can be anything,
in my mind. And that's my impression...

41
00:03:46,058 --> 00:03:48,728
my impression of W.
Kinda like a drunk marionette.

42
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,816
The thing about Trump, though,

43
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:58,112
if you agree with him, you might
kinda like him on certain subjects,

44
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,240
'cause he's such a blunt force instrument.

45
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,658
Like, who else would you want,

46
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,994
if he was afraid of global warming at
a global warming conference, than Trump?

47
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:08,498
'Cause he would be like, "You know...
you know, you're stupid countries.

48
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,334
You're very stupid.
You're stupid, stupid countries.

49
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,297
You're a disaster. You're a disaster.
You're spewing stuff in the air.

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,925
It's a disaster. It's a disaster.
You're a stupid, stupid disaster.

51
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,344
The whole planet's getting hot.
Even the grass is hot.

52
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,013
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch...

53
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:31,771
I will be so good with global warming.
I will be so, so good with global warming.

54
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,442
I will make CO2 pay for it.
I promise you that.

55
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,572
I know how to make glaciers.
I know how to make glaciers.

56
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,657
I can make a lot of glaciers, okay?

57
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,619
I will take all the ice
from the Trump Hotels...

58
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,705
It's a lot of ice. I can promise you that.

59
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,833
I will put it
on the Carnival cruise ships.

60
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,543
They're friends of mine.
I know these people."

61
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,305
It's a trip, man.

62
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,933
Hillary and Bill.
Hillary and Bill.

63
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,102
What a story.

64
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,524
I feel like Bill's got a headset.
He's got a microphone behind the scenes.

65
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,652
"Big Dog to Little Hill.
Big Dog to Little Hill.

66
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,072
Come in, Little Hill.
Big Dog to Little Hill.

67
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,407
Come on, baby. Come on.

68
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,243
Come in, Big Dog, Little Hill.
Big Dog, Little Hill.

69
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,747
Baby, you gotta slow down.
You gotta slow down.

70
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,459
You can't emphasize things
that don't need emphasizing, baby.

71
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,670
Now, take it easy. Here it comes.
Just do it real soft-like, okay?"

72
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:44,093
And Hillary's like...
"We will do the things that we need to do

73
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,513
until we don't do them...

74
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:52,435
because we don't need
to do them anymore."

75
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,606
"No, baby. No, baby. Ain't working.

76
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,150
Slow down, peaches and cream."

77
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:06,824
It's just so much stuff out there.

78
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,368
Obama...

79
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:15,166
Obama was the best I'd seen, politically,
of creating gravitas all the time

80
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:16,709
because he would pause.

81
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,505
He would just take his time,
and it made you lean in.

82
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,674
I mean, I could listen to him
do nursery rhymes,

83
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,511
and it would have gravitas
with the way he can talk.

84
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,222
He'd be like...
"'Jack and Jill went up the hill...

85
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,652
...to fetch a pail of water.

86
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,906
Jack fell down and broke his crown.'

87
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:55,457
That's a teachable moment."

88
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,756
"'Three blind mice.

89
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,425
Three blind mice.

90
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,803
Chase a farmer's wife
or cut off their tail with a knife.'

91
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,848
The question you gotta ask yourself,

92
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,726
'Why are these mice blind
in the first place?

93
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,144
What kind of healthcare program
have they got?'"

94
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,778
Harvard intellectual, big vocabulary.

95
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,073
'Cause in a way, Bush gave birth to Obama,

96
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:31,576
'cause Bush, for eight years,
is just hearing this...

97
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,123
And then it was just refreshing,
that baritone.

98
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,668
"This is what we're prepared to do.
That's the truth.

99
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,297
No, no. No, no. No, no. That's not right.

100
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,673
Nope. Never.

101
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,385
That's... what... we're gonna..."

102
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,303
It's just a pleasant sound.

103
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,392
But to try to hear Obama figure out
the complexity in the Middle East,

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,811
it's very tough, even for him. It's like,

105
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,732
"What we're continuing to do
in terms of the caliphate,

106
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,610
what... what our partners, our coalition,

107
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,237
strategically, with air strikes,
no boots on the ground,

108
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,741
our intelligence, what we, the...

109
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,622
What our... The northern...
The Syrian rebels with a general, um...

110
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:22,835
The effort... the effort to defeat ISIS,
ISIL, Daesh, with the...

111
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,462
The Ottoman Empire with the Turks.

112
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:31,677
The Peshmerga with Netanyahu and Hamas,
in terms of...

113
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,182
The proxy war,
Khomeini with the Saudis and the...

114
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,268
The Shia, the Sunni, Putin and Assad.

115
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,148
It's fucked up."

116
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,535
"It's a shitstorm."

117
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:02,875
Notice how anybody and everybody
is now Hitler?

118
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,211
You noticed that?
They called Obama Hitler.

119
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,756
They called Trump Hitler.
They called Bush Hitler, you know.

120
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,634
And Hitler's a fascinating guy.
There's only one Hitler.

121
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:16,889
And Hitler always was animated and loud,
when you'd see him in news reels.

122
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,183
He's like...

123
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,774
No human being can sustain that.

124
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,697
So, I often thought that Hitler would be
just exhausted backstage.

125
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,325
You know, so tired he's almost effeminate.

126
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:41,413
And he's like really manipulative,
like any man or woman of power.

127
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,040
He'd be like... "Himmler.

128
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,920
Himmler, my little SS man.

129
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,760
So stealthy, so secretive.

130
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,891
Everyone loves your haircut,
but we don't know who your barber is.

131
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,899
You complete me, Himmler.

132
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:12,528
Sometimes we're at a meeting,
and there is an awkward silence,

133
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,822
'What are we going to do
with all these Jews?'

134
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:19,869
And then you say, 'How about build
more camps?' And I say, 'What he said.'

135
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:28,460
Send in Göring. Hello, Göring,
my chubby, little Luftwaffe man.

136
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,464
You're tubby, aren't you?

137
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,884
Don't shame yourself.

138
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,136
In the future,
scientists will probably determine

139
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,014
that you have a genetic predisposition

140
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,975
to crave processed carbohydrates,
that's all.

141
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,188
I have one cookie, I put it down.

142
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,775
You have one cookie, your brain
throws a party, you want 100 cookies.

143
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,405
Goebbels and I laugh a lot,
we see you at a party.

144
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:59,158
'Look at tubby.
He's dive-bombing a cookie.'

145
00:11:00,492 --> 00:11:04,872
All I'm saying is,
don't blitzkrieg cinnamon toast.

146
00:11:09,501 --> 00:11:12,546
You're husky,
but you're my husky, General.

147
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:14,215
And now I'm going to take a nap."

148
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:17,927
I don't have a final line for this bit,
but that's all I'm saying right now.

149
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,224
Speaking of Bernie Sanders...

150
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,439
You gotta love Bernie.
You gotta love Bernie.

151
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:33,609
Bernie is what he is,
what he is, what he is.

152
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,403
I mean, the energy he's got.

153
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:39,866
This is the Bernie Sanders phenomenon
distilled for you. This is my impression.

154
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:43,119
"What I'm prepared to do...

155
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,622
What I'm prepared to do...

156
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,167
I will find people with money.

157
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,379
I will take their money...

158
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,715
and give it to people
that don't have money."

159
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,184
He's like a sleepwalking Frankenstein.

160
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,733
"I will find a rich prick.

161
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,444
You look like a rich prick.

162
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,825
I will take your money and give it
to the poor bastard sitting next to you."

163
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,459
I don't know, to me...
I'm a boomer, but to me,

164
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:34,336
you know, capitalism is an Apple Store.

165
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,423
Socialism is
the Department of Motor Vehicles.

166
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,511
And I love them
Department of Motor Vehicles.

167
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:46,098
Sweaty, pissed-off workers
that can't get fired, just yelling.

168
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,266
And they laugh at you.

169
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,021
"You got in the wrong line,
you fucking idiot."

170
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,113
Then you go to an Apple Store.
It's like a Stanley Kubrick film.

171
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,200
"Welcome to the Apple Store.

172
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,955
Do you like all of our beautiful toys?

173
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,127
Are you in the market
for a 2017 fully-loaded MacBook Pro

174
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:19,632
with, wait for it,
264 gigabytes of storage?

175
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:25,137
Or would you like to visit the Genius Bar
for some mental stimulation?"

176
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,895
I personally like making money
in a capitalist country

177
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,606
and then going to a socialist country.

178
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,817
I love Italy.
I love Italy because...

179
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,111
too much pressure in America, man.

180
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,865
You gotta do...
Keep up with everybody.

181
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,492
But in Italy, they don't care
what you make for a living.

182
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,743
You're just a person.

183
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,703
"Relax. Have a glass of wine.

184
00:13:49,786 --> 00:13:51,830
It's Italy, all right?

185
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,084
Yeah, you make a little love.
You have a little wine. It's all right.

186
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,044
Here, have some wine."
"It's 7:00 a.m."

187
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,796
"Like I said, here we go.

188
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,507
Let's be honest.

189
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,426
We're never going to have
a space program."

190
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,979
"Why go to the moon
when you can sing to the moon?"

191
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,276
♪ Oh, my moon ♪

192
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,321
♪ We're never going to go to you ♪

193
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,574
♪ Because to go to you ♪

194
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,412
♪ Would be way too much work ♪

195
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,251
I feel income inequality
on airplanes, man.

196
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:42,131
'Cause I have extra money, I get to ride
in the pointy part of the airplane,

197
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,716
and you just feel like a rich prick.

198
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,052
You're up there.

199
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,222
You've got your New York Times
and your champagne, a big leather seat,

200
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,434
and then... and then they arrive.

201
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,479
The lost masses coming
through the porthole.

202
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:01,442
Just hundreds of them, like refugees
with carry-on the size of their bodies.

203
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:05,487
"Go! Go!"

204
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,199
Little girls will come up
and just stare at me.

205
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,038
Mothers with six kids.
"Why can't we stay here, Mommy?"

206
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,624
"'Cause they don't want us here.

207
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,919
Get back in the shitty seats."

208
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,463
"Why do they get to stay up here?"

209
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:26,300
"'Cause they don't pay
their fair share of taxes."

210
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,683
There's eight of us and 300 of them.
It's the most unequal thing in the world.

211
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,187
That's why I like Aer Lingus,
'cause they just... this Irish airways.

212
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,106
They're very equal in Ireland.

213
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,358
First class and coach,
it's almost identical.

214
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,151
Just slightly bigger seat.

215
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,444
They come on,
"Well,

216
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,863
if you think you're a little bit full
of yourself,

217
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,533
I have the discretion to put you back
in the tiny seats at any time."

218
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,749
Have you ever gone on Aer Lingus?
Ever heard of Aer Lingus? This Irish...

219
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,210
It's very cool.

220
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:05,839
Why anybody would name
their airline Aer Lingus, I can't fathom.

221
00:16:05,922 --> 00:16:09,051
Sounds vaguely pornographic, doesn't it?

222
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,469
"Welcome to Aer Lingus,

223
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,097
where you get a little something extra
with your ticket."

224
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,352
You go in, it's very humble.
There's just benches.

225
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,854
"Here's some yarn.
Strap yourself in.

226
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:23,983
Here's a shot of whiskey and a potato.
See you in Dublin."

227
00:16:27,819 --> 00:16:29,655
And like I said, I don't like to fly.

228
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,656
We're out on the tarmac.

229
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,117
I was flying with my wife's aunt
and uncle from Ireland,

230
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,036
and I asked,
"Who does the maintenance on this?"

231
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,454
And she was very Irish Catholic.
She goes,

232
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:41,000
"I think Jesus
can do the maintenance just fine.

233
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:48,632
And Jesus said unto his disciples,
'Righty tighty, lefty loosey.'"

234
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,389
So, it was cool in the beginning,
then we hit some wicked turbulence.

235
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,515
The pilot comes on,

236
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,101
"Well, this is
Captain Patrick O'Shaughnessy.

237
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,228
As you can see, ladies and gents,

238
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,565
the angels and demons are having a bit
of a tussle tonight.

239
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,859
We suggest you sit back and relax
and have a few pints of Guinness

240
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,945
like we do up here in the cockpit.

241
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,492
There's nothing like five,
six, seven pints of Guinness

242
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,496
to make all these knobs, dials
and switches mean something to us

243
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,832
in the pointy part of the aeroplane.

244
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,418
If you check under your seat,

245
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,546
you'll see you have an individual keg
of Guinness beer.

246
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,175
In the unlikely event
your keg loses pressure,

247
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,886
a little yellow straw will come down
from the ceiling.

248
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,392
Be sure your straw is free-flowing
with Guinness for yourself

249
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,979
before you assist your child, infant,
or toddler with their Guinness."

250
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,824
"There's nothing like a few pints
of Guinness

251
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:57,868
for a newborn to build the bones."

252
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,996
So, we're back there,
drinking our free Guinnesses.

253
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,207
He comes back, like, 45 minutes later.

254
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,292
"This is
Captain Paddy O'Shaughnessy."

255
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,731
"Oh, yes! Thank...

256
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,026
thank God.

257
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,778
Thank God and Jesus himself

258
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:36,448
for the little button I like
to call autopilot.

259
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:41,453
Do you ever wonder how this big gob
of steel gets up in the first place?

260
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,247
Every time she lifts off the tarmac,

261
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,502
I say a little prayer to myself,
'Fly, fucker, fly!'

262
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:54,800
♪ Oh, Danny Boy
Oh, Danny Boy ♪

263
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,180
My copilot Danny O'Sullivan
passed out 19 minutes ago.

264
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,685
He had a bite
of a five-leaf hallucinogenic clover.

265
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,062
The last thing he said
before he passed out was,

266
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:11,192
'My God, I can fly!'

267
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,408
I'll leave you with a little joke, ladies
and gentiles, before we land in Dublin.

268
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,868
Two Irishmen walk out of a bar.

269
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,413
It could happen."

270
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,502
So...

271
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,504
Thank you.

272
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:38,009
I'm so glad that my sons
are in their 20s now,

273
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,305
because they are nightmares
when they're teenagers.

274
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:46,768
'Cause teenagers are literally insane,
and their plans are insane,

275
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,854
and you have to hear them out
as the parent,

276
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,856
'cause you want to say no right away.

277
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,149
But literally, when they were teenagers,
I'd hear stuff like,

278
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,403
"Uh, we're gonna drive
to Lake Tahoe tonight."

279
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,239
"Really? When are you leaving?"

280
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,033
"We're gonna leave
at 3:30 in the morning."

281
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,203
"Who's driving?"
"Eduardo."

282
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,914
"Who's that?" "He's a substitute teacher
at Drake High School."

283
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,083
"How many are going?"

284
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,920
"There'll be 19 of us
in his Cadillac Eldorado.

285
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,214
I'm gonna ride in the trunk.

286
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:20,469
We're gonna drive for 13 hours,
snowboard for 11 minutes and ride back."

287
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,557
So, as a parent, you have to say no,

288
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,018
and then they walk off
with that teenage walk,

289
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,854
and under their breath they go,
"Bunch of fucking bullshit."

290
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,444
You know that walk? In Montana,
they call it "all hat and no cattle."

291
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,029
"Bunch of fucking bullshit."

292
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,577
This person has no 401,
no property ownership.

293
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,289
Just... "Bunch of fucking bullshit, man."

294
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,753
There's so much attitude,
there's almost no forward motion.

295
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,463
They can't even go forward.

296
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:05,306
I just love the sound of that teenage,
"Bunch of fucking bullshit."

297
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:10,686
It's like it's its own language.

298
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:16,817
Never take teenage boys to Europe.
It's a waste of time and money.

299
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,905
Don't do it.
They don't care about a statue of David.

300
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:25,284
I thought it was gorgeous.
They just laughed for two hours.

301
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,785
"Look at his balls.

302
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,789
I thought it was a work of art."

303
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:32,958
One thing that was funny.

304
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,045
We went to Italy,
and my wife studied Italian for a year,

305
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,547
so she could speak and everything.

306
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,300
So, I'm in the gym,
and I'm on the treadmill.

307
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,886
And when it went faster,
it said, "Difficoltà."

308
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:49,933
And I thought, "I can speak Italian
if I add a vowel and cop an attitude."

309
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,686
So, we're in Lake Como... I know.

310
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,648
We were there waiting for the boat
to come, whatever, the ferry.

311
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,776
My wife's trying to figure out how
to ask when it's gonna arrive,

312
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,113
and I just leaned in and went,
"Arrivi de boate?"

313
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:07,826
And it worked!

314
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,247
I was our interpreter for a week.
It was like...

315
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,790
When you go on Lake Como,

316
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,752
every boat driver goes,
"You like to see George Clooney's house?"

317
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,253
They're obsessed with George Clooney.

318
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,131
Pictures in every restaurant of George.

319
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,260
So, after the tenth time,
I just yelled at the guy,

320
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,554
"Sicke of de Clooney."

321
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:34,352
I heard him, under his breath, go,
"Bunch of fucking bullshit."

322
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:40,316
We went to Rome, okay?
So, Rome is unbelievable.

323
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,152
We were in the Roman Colosseum,

324
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,029
and my wife and I are having the time
of our life.

325
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,615
It's history. It's Rome. My God!

326
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:51,662
My son, 18 at the time,
no exaggeration, literally said this.

327
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,246
"Uh...

328
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,835
Is this pretty much
all we're gonna do today?"

329
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,603
I said, "Yeah, pretty much."
"Bunch of fucking bullshit."

330
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,819
I kinda love that attitude.
There's a rhythm to that.

331
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,489
When I heard it, I thought,
"I'm gonna use that as a catchphrase."

332
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,990
"Bunch of fucking bullshit."

333
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,161
And I tried to give it to my son,
'cause he's a stand-up comedian.

334
00:23:33,244 --> 00:23:36,582
He's the one who said it.
He goes, "It doesn't sound funny to me."

335
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:39,334
I would use it in real life.

336
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,128
The IRS tries to audit you,
"Bunch of fucking bullshit."

337
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:46,550
Doin' a different son.

338
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,469
Are those millennials arriving?
Anyone? Millennials?

339
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,848
Yeah. All right. Under 35?

340
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,350
Yeah. Awesome.

341
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,686
Look at you. She's gorgeous. Wow!

342
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,355
Young, pretty. Look at these millennials.

343
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,191
"Coming in late, man.
Hitting the bar kinda hard.

344
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:05,110
They'll hold the seats."

345
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,364
You're like superheroes.
Enjoy your youth, man.

346
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,576
Touch your toes. Never take a nap.

347
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:21,126
Pound those drinks. Wake up fresh.

348
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,463
You guys are not gonna mess up your life
like the baby boomers.

349
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,383
We were way too ambitious, man.

350
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,052
Millennials,
you're not gonna mess up your life.

351
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,681
You're gonna work small, live small.

352
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,394
Smart. Smart.

353
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,396
Have some roommates.

354
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,314
Maybe own a bike.

355
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,029
You guys don't even need cars.
We had to get cars to be cool.

356
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,446
You're just gonna Uber it up.

357
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,826
You're so brilliant at some things.

358
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,413
I mean, millennials are just so fast
with their fingers,

359
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:01,708
and they can Call of Duty
and Skype and text.

360
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:05,378
But you're completely crippled
when it comes to basic things.

361
00:25:05,461 --> 00:25:07,798
'Cause your parents
are always right there,

362
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,174
and they're the experts.

363
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,802
Typical millennial kid will go, "Uh, Mom?

364
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:15,513
Uh... we don't have any heat
in our apartment."

365
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,019
And the mom goes,
"You should probably call your landlord."

366
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,145
Millennial kid,

367
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,105
"Uh...

368
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:29,820
I'm not real good at calling landlords.

369
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:34,908
Could you do it?"

370
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,124
And we do.

371
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,002
We do call the landlord,

372
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,880
because we don't want them to be sad.

373
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:55,345
Most photographed generation in history,
you millennial.

374
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:59,307
Thousands and thousands of pictures
with your obsessed parents.

375
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,436
I'm a baby boomer.
I have one picture of my childhood.

376
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:08,483
One blurry, black and white photo
the size of a postage stamp.

377
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,943
I can't...

378
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,946
I can't tell if I'm smiling
or shitting my pants.

379
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,700
And the parents are obsessed.

380
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,870
God, just please, parents,
holster your phone.

381
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,997
I don't wanna see pictures of your kids.

382
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,040
Come on, you're out to dinner
with baby boomer parents.

383
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,251
"Have you seen Benjamin?"

384
00:26:27,418 --> 00:26:29,880
I don't give a fuck about Benjamin.

385
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,591
I don't care.

386
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,139
Millennials.

387
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,932
How old are you, ma'am?

388
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,810
Twenty-nine. Wow. Sweet spot.

389
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,648
Well...

390
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,065
And I'm a lascivious old man.

391
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,068
I just mean
women underestimate their beauty.

392
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,445
Your skin is perfect, the neck...

393
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,781
I mean,
everything has just arrived basically.

394
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,409
It's great. You're sexy. You're sexy.

395
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,619
I know that you got Pornhub,
whatever you've got,

396
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:05,123
but you're not as sexy
as a mature woman.

397
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,834
I have friends now
who are dating women in their early 20s.

398
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,169
They're in their 50s.

399
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,546
And...

400
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,882
...there's just no "there, there."

401
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,508
I'm sorry. Just from my point of view.

402
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,719
'Cause we're out at a restaurant,
this woman goes,

403
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:22,473
"Oh, my God, the dragon rolls
are so good here.

404
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,773
I'm obsessed with these dragon rolls."

405
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,234
I go, "What about global poverty?"
"What?"

406
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,658
Young women don't really know what
to do with their body

407
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:40,742
like a mature woman,

408
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,119
who's had children,
and she's in her 50s.

409
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,454
A young woman is like,

410
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,708
"Oh, my God,
what are you trying to do to me?"

411
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:49,584
Older woman is like,

412
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,586
"Oh, my God.

413
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,716
What are you trying to do to me?"

414
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:05,141
Sex gets good in your 50s, doesn't it?
Look at these smiling seniors.

415
00:28:06,392 --> 00:28:08,436
Look at these "Can't make a baby,

416
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:11,022
some pills, some ointments,
some light stretching.

417
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,024
Oh, my God!

418
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:16,528
Oh, my God, that's... Whoa, whoa!"

419
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,739
Oh, yeah, you got it all going on.

420
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,908
Yeehaw! Yeah!

421
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,077
Who knew?

422
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,539
The thing about it, though,
is that, you know...

423
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:34,045
the divorce rate for men and women
in their 50s has quadrupled.

424
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:37,007
Quadrupled in the last decade.

425
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,677
You know why?
Because science will not let us die.

426
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,306
Okay, think about it. Okay.

427
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:48,018
You're sitting there,
you're with someone for 25 years,

428
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:49,144
you're in your 50s,

429
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,312
and at one point,
even in the best marriage,

430
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,899
you're thinking...

431
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,738
"Three more decades? Really?

432
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,368
With this bag of nothing?

433
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:10,081
Three more decades
of watching him drool in his sleep?"

434
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,375
Three more decades of her going,

435
00:29:12,458 --> 00:29:14,710
"I'm kind of gassy today."

436
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,426
Even in the best marriage, at one point,
you look over and go...

437
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:25,388
"Not my best choice."

438
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,437
I don't wanna bum you out, but it's true.

439
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,192
I'm heavily medicated right now.

440
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,985
I don't know about you guys.

441
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:40,779
Don't you love the pharmacy?

442
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,909
Don't you love the social dynamic
of the pharmacy? I just love it.

443
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,660
You go in there. Everyone's uptight.

444
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,537
You know the pharmacist
in the white lab,

445
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,248
he's dipping into whatever
they got back there.

446
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,210
And there's always an old guy off
to the side

447
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,878
who's clearly been there all day.

448
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,547
"Did my doctor call?

449
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:07,097
Did my doctor call?"

450
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,933
They always know his name
'cause he's there so...

451
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,184
"No, Bill, he didn't call.

452
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,229
Try the blood pressure machine again.
That's always fun."

453
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:19,275
When it's packed on a Friday afternoon,
man, it's intense.

454
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,820
And you're supposed
to stay behind the privacy barrier,

455
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,822
so you can't hear what they're getting.

456
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,574
Don't you wanna know what they're getting?

457
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:27,826
Did you ever do an I Love Lucy,

458
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,161
where you just kind of creep up
and look around?

459
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,373
"What do they need to get through life?"

460
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,292
I hate it when you get
a pissed-off, sweaty,

461
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,503
drugged-out pharmacist
on a Friday afternoon.

462
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,338
The whole place is packed.

463
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,966
He starts yelling out.
You can hear what people are getting.

464
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,801
It's embarrassing. "We got a pick up.
I can't make out the name here.

465
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:51,141
Pick up Zoloft, Imodium
and Ambien, anybody?

466
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:58,189
Pick up Zoloft, Imodium and Ambien,
anybody?

467
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,528
I need a nutball with diarrhea
who can't sleep. Come on up!

468
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,034
You sleepless, diarrhetic nutball!"

469
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,828
And then the guy has to do
the walk of shame in front of everybody.

470
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:26,176
"Pick up Crestor and Plavix.

471
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,387
I need a heart attack waiting to happen.
Come on!"

472
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,685
Everyone just thinking,
"Which ones am I taking?"

473
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,897
"Propecia, Adderall and Cialis.

474
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:45,361
Pick up, I can't make it out,
Propecia, Adderall and Cialis.

475
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:49,157
I need a cue ball who's too distracted
to know he can't get an erection.

476
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,825
Come on up!"

477
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,000
Is it me or does it seem like

478
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,378
the pharmaceutical companies
are just making up diseases

479
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,714
so they can sell us drugs?

480
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:09,302
I mean, you watch TV
and it's just so weird.

481
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:14,349
I'm waiting for, "Does your tongue
seem smaller than it used to be?

482
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:22,315
You may be suffering
from Tiny Tongue Syndrome.

483
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,735
Has the cat got your tongue?

484
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:29,655
Afraid to eat ice cream in public?

485
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,077
Introducing all-new Tenultra.

486
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,371
Most patients experience
some tongue growth

487
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,664
in as little as four to six weeks.

488
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,500
Get back in the game.

489
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,003
Call your doctor. Get Tenultra!"

490
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,757
"Thank you, Tenultra.
Thank you.

491
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,178
Because of you,
my tongue is almost normal size."

492
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:05,525
"Side effects include elongated torso,

493
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,777
thick, matted stomach hair,

494
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,030
and sudden anal closure."

495
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:17,495
Now, here's a little, what I call,
"TED Talk with jokes" section.

496
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,706
'Cause if I don't got wisdom,
I got nothing.

497
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:24,085
I'm a straight, white male,
60 years of age.

498
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,461
Yeah, I know.

499
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,049
Straight, white male.

500
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:33,011
So people think I'm racist, sexist,
xenophobic, homophobic, Islamophobic

501
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:35,055
and misogynistic.

502
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:36,597
Pretty much me.

503
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:42,395
I'm not a part of a particularly
popular group of people right now.

504
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:46,066
I totally understand.
My ancestors did some nasty shit.

505
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:50,486
I mean, these white guys, they raped
and pilfered and plundered and enslaved,

506
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,489
and conquered nations
and ruined the environment.

507
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,408
But you gotta admit, they were busy.

508
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,457
I was raised Lutheran, by the way.

509
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,544
I don't know if you guys are
hardcore Irish Catholics or whatever here.

510
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,716
I was Lutheran. Lutheran's pretty cool,
'cause we're not really hardcore.

511
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:13,968
It's kind of casual.

512
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:18,431
I mean, you knew that no one in the church
really believed that much.

513
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,767
Even our hymns were agnostic.
It'll be like...

514
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,104
♪ I'll believe if you'll believe ♪

515
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:30,235
♪ I'll believe if you'll believe ♪

516
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:35,448
♪ On Sunday, I believe
By Wednesday, I have doubts ♪

517
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:39,535
♪ But by Sunday, I believe again ♪

518
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,372
♪ Oh, if you believe, I'll believe
Oh, yay! ♪

519
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,505
♪ Jesus, son of God or just a nice guy? ♪

520
00:34:55,926 --> 00:35:01,056
Don't get me wrong. I love Jesus.
My wife's Irish Catholic. I love Jesus.

521
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:03,851
But Jesus was never the father
to a teenage boy.

522
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:07,188
That would have challenged even Jesus.

523
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:10,316
"I am the light. I am the way."

524
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,067
"No, you're not.

525
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,615
Why do you walk around
with your palms like that, all out?

526
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,492
It looks really stupid."

527
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,875
"Spread the gospel, my son."

528
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:33,339
"Uh, I'm not real good
at spreading the gospel.

529
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,385
Could you do it?"

530
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,934
And Jesus was... He drank.

531
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,562
But how much did Jesus drink?
Do you ever wonder?

532
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,774
Did he ever put his hand over his goblet
and go, "I'm good. I am good"?

533
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:57,280
Is it possible Jesus
was a highly functioning alcoholic?

534
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,865
You know, Mark says to Matthew,

535
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:02,785
"Healed the leper, but he was lit.

536
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:09,459
We can't send him to rehab.
He can turn water into wine. Jesus!

537
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,671
The other night at dinner, he says,
'One of you will betray me.'

538
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:16,591
Classic alcoholic behavior.

539
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,429
Last week,
he said he wanted to walk on water.

540
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,972
We gathered everyone around.

541
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,476
He was so shit-faced, he just floated
on his back for a half hour."

542
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,481
If God had made four sons,

543
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,900
could Jesus have opted out
on the messiah thing?

544
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,652
"Dad, I don't really feel
like being the messiah.

545
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,029
Can't Doug do it?"

546
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:44,327
Then those exorcist movies would be like,
"The power of Doug compels you.

547
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,704
The power of Doug compels you."

548
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:54,337
I love faith, but I think it's good
to have some doubts,

549
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,672
so you don't do crazy shit.

550
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,424
I mean, I think what America needs,

551
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,552
we need an ISIS guy with doubts.

552
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:05,473
You know, just a guy sitting there...

553
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,308
"Buckner...

554
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,811
I don't know, Buckner.

555
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,023
You know, sometimes things pop
into my head. I don't really know.

556
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,109
You know, the whole, you know,

557
00:37:17,192 --> 00:37:22,490
if I put on a suicide vest, go boom,
then I wake up and there are 72 virgins.

558
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,452
It's just so specific.

559
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,457
But I'm sure it's totally true.
I'm sure. I don't...

560
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,501
I'm just saying ideas pop in my head,

561
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,086
like, maybe women could drive.

562
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,964
I don't know. Crazy.

563
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,636
What if occasionally I had a beer?
Would that be terrible?

564
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,890
I mean, sometimes I think these things.
I don't know, Buckner.

565
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,809
Why can't the women...
I love the way we dress.

566
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,811
We cover them,
the little eyes and everything,

567
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,146
but maybe they could wear a nice pair
of Levi's

568
00:37:54,229 --> 00:37:56,649
and a little halter top
from the Gap or something."

569
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,362
"I mean, do we really have
to kill the nonbelievers?

570
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:03,531
Couldn't we really just get them
in a headlock and go,

571
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,617
'You better...'?"

572
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,707
There's so much darkness in the world.

573
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:16,627
I think we're being hypnotized
into darkness with these machines.

574
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,338
I mean,
my parents would get the darkest news,

575
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,675
but they were getting it
in the 1930s and 1940s.

576
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,802
They would hear newsreels.

577
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,972
And they were playful and kind of fun,
no matter how dark it was.

578
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,098
You'd be watching a movie,

579
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,474
and before the movie,
they'd come on, they'd be like,

580
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:33,894
"News out of 1945 in the Pacific Theater.

581
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,020
Ladies and gentlemen,

582
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,858
as the Empire of Japan
has officially refused to surrender,

583
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,736
America says, 'No go, Tokyo.'

584
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,948
Say hello to Fat Man and Little Boy.

585
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:48,409
20,000 tons of TNT.

586
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,536
Sayonara."

587
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,749
I mean, when I first thought of this,

588
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,959
I thought of
the Bruce Jenner/Caitlyn Jenner thing.

589
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,128
I'm friends with Bruce Jenner.
I've not met Caitlyn.

590
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,713
I'm sure she's really cool.

591
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:04,258
I personally don't care what anyone does.

592
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,552
Transgender, gay, I don't care
what anyone wants to do.

593
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,220
I mean, I have a friend
who's trans-bestial.

594
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,473
He's becoming a cat. I don't care.

595
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,395
But I thought that should've been
more playful. It was so heavy.

596
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:19,023
"He's becoming a woman. Oh, my God!"
It should have just been like,

597
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,942
"And Olympic gold medalist, Bruce Jenner,
has announced today

598
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,487
that he would like to become a she.

599
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,865
And guess what, she's gorgeous."

600
00:39:30,075 --> 00:39:33,413
And when I thought of that,
I called my friend, Jon Lovitz,

601
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,206
because it sounded like Jon.

602
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,460
And I said,
"Jon, I just thought of a bit.

603
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:40,670
I want to give it to you."

604
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,463
And I told him, and he laughed.

605
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,131
And I go, "Jon, you can have it."

606
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:48,553
He paused and went,
"I'll write my own material."

607
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,355
But there's really only two kinds
of people in the world,

608
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:00,648
there's the decent and the indecent.

609
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,024
I do think that order matters.

610
00:40:02,107 --> 00:40:05,611
And I think that Cosby's mistake...

611
00:40:08,363 --> 00:40:12,702
Yeah. Cosby did things out of order.
That's all.

612
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:13,828
He did it out of order.

613
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:18,749
If he had consensual sex with a woman,
and then gave her an Ambien,

614
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,292
no problem.

615
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:27,007
If he gets off and tries it again,
it'll never work. Everybody knows.

616
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:30,010
But if he's 90, demented, he'll still try.

617
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:34,139
"So, I got to put the pill
in the bitty, and I touch the titty?"

618
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,310
"No, Bill. Nothing's gonna happen."

619
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:41,146
"But I take the pill,
and I put it in the bitty,

620
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,732
and I touch the titty?"

621
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,944
"Not gonna happen, Bill.
I'm sorry, Mr. Cosby. No."

622
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,655
"But I did the bitty, did the titty..."

623
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,077
Sometimes, I'll see stuff that inspires me
to do a bit.

624
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,746
And I watched this documentary
about China.

625
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,667
Now, I don't know if it's me,
but they always seem so depressed.

626
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:03,503
Have you noticed,
when they have the interpreter,

627
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:07,756
it's kinda like, what you hear is...

628
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,885
"I live in a village
of 90 million people."

629
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,026
"We all work in the same factory."

630
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,785
"All we make are buttons.
That's all we make."

631
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:52,301
"Oprah Winfrey says,
'God has a plan for everybody.'"

632
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,643
"My dream as a child was
to play the cello."

633
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:07,066
"But the People's Republic of China said,
'Dreams are for sleeping.'"

634
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:18,828
"Five kilometers south
is the village of Xinhua."

635
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:23,958
"It's a village of 490 million people."

636
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,216
"All they make are shoestrings.
That's all they make."

637
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,308
"This bit's going over better
than I thought it would."

638
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:57,157
"I live on the 620th floor
of an apartment building."

639
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,708
"If the elevators break, it can take
two months to get out of the building."

640
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,887
"Sometimes, I camp out
on the 300th floor."

641
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,768
"I now have a girlfriend."

642
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,188
"She works in a toothbrush factory."

643
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,651
"All they make are toothbrushes.

644
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:35,529
That's all they make."

645
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:46,749
"She lost her hands
in a toothbrush-related accident."

646
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,377
"I told her what Oprah said,

647
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,838
and she said she wanted to flip Oprah off,

648
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:55,590
but she didn't have the fingers to do it."

649
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,519
"I haven't lost my sense of humor."

650
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:12,817
"My favorite comedian
is the American Donald Trump."

651
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,296
I come from a pretty modest background.

652
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:38,383
We were five kids in our family,
1,200 square feet, one bathroom...

653
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:43,347
We were the kind of family where
the syrup bottle always had ants on it.

654
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,767
No one ever knew where the hammer was.

655
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:49,770
"Where's the hammer?
Anyone know where the hammer is?

656
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,688
Has anyone seen the hammer?"

657
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,526
My... This is an imperfect impression
of my dad,

658
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,945
last time I talked politics with him.
Okay?

659
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:03,158
"Oh, I can't talk politics with you,
because you don't know shit."

660
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,960
He's one of those dads
you could never show weakness.

661
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,294
"I can't find my car keys."

662
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,380
"I always know where my car keys are.

663
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:19,008
I keep 'em in my pocket, you little shit!"

664
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,594
"I'm cold."

665
00:45:22,677 --> 00:45:25,389
"I'm never cold,
'cause I dress in layers!"

666
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:31,561
I don't know about old guys.
When they turn 70,

667
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,481
they just start wearing
bright pastel colors.

668
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:36,233
They look like the Joker.

669
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,778
He came out in a pink shirt
and yellow pants.

670
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,112
"You're wearing yellow pants."

671
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,989
"They're canary!"

672
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,953
These old men and their cars, man.

673
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,705
They have so much ego about gas mileage.

674
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,626
He goes, "I get 25 miles to the gallon
in my Buick."

675
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:56,628
I go, "I get 28 in my Pilot."

676
00:45:56,711 --> 00:45:58,338
"Oh, bullshit!"

677
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,681
I showed him a computer when he was 75.

678
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:11,643
He goes,
"Oh, computer is a waste of time. Stupid.

679
00:46:11,726 --> 00:46:15,981
If you get a computer, you're just
on the computer all day, God damn it."

680
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,193
Were there people like that
throughout history?

681
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:23,572
Like, "The printing press.
Who needs it? Jesus Christ!"

682
00:46:26,616 --> 00:46:27,659
In the Stone Age,

683
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,246
"The wheel! What's the wheel for?

684
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,165
If the pharaoh needs a ride,

685
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:36,626
we'll just carry him on his throne,
you big dummies!"

686
00:46:41,506 --> 00:46:43,592
I was able to help him out
and give him extra money.

687
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:44,718
I'm happy to do that.

688
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,262
But when he got older, he forgot my name.

689
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,264
And so, he just called me Money.

690
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:54,311
He'd go to my siblings,
"Have you seen Money?"

691
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,230
They'd go, "Dana?"

692
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,731
"Who the hell is Dana?

693
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,442
We need some money! From Money!"

694
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,990
Five kids. Wild, crazy family.

695
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:11,871
My brother, Brad, who I based Garth on,
was one of my older brothers.

696
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,539
And Garth is completely Brad.

697
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,666
And the thing about Brad was,
he was a science kid.

698
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,418
So, this is a true story again.

699
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,963
I found a dead frog.
I was, like, nine years old.

700
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,757
And I thought it was dead.
I brought it to Brad.

701
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,219
He attaches it
to two D-cell batteries, right?

702
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:31,181
And I'm looking at the frog.

703
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,102
And I go, "Brad... the eye.
His eye is opening."

704
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:38,647
And Brad said, quote,
just like this, no exaggeration,

705
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:42,985
"Yeah. I brought him back to life.
He'll never die again."

706
00:47:52,161 --> 00:47:55,164
When I did the movie, I got severe TMJ.

707
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,168
And I went to the dentist,
and she goes, "You've got TMJ."

708
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,294
And I go, "Yeah, it hurts here."

709
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,545
And she goes, "What have you been doing?"

710
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:05,465
And I say, "Well, I've been
making this face all summer long."

711
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,720
She says, "You've got to stop doing that."

712
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,307
I said, "Not for what they're
paying me, bitch!"

713
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:21,148
In my childhood,
I was a dishwasher. I was a busboy.

714
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,651
We called ourselves
Table Maintenance Personnel Managers.

715
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,279
And I was a waiter.

716
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,740
And what was cool was I waited
on my heroes.

717
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:32,909
I waited on George Carlin
and Richard Pryor.

718
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:39,166
Isn't that weird? I waited...
I brought George Carlin a bowl of oatmeal.

719
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,625
And I put it in front of him, and he goes,

720
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,546
"Oatmeal. Drop the 'O,'
and you have 'atmeal.'"

721
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,216
Wow. That's just...

722
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:54,222
And then, I gave Richard Pryor
a Denver omelet.

723
00:48:54,974 --> 00:48:57,226
And afterwards, I'll never forget it,
he goes,

724
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:01,521
"Whoever made this omelet
can suck my dick!"

725
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,529
And I never knew
if that was a positive or a negative.

726
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,701
I always wondered.

727
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:19,248
I end up in a movie with Richard Pryor,
12 years later, called Moving.

728
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,750
Honor. I'm there with Richard,
and I had to know.

729
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,919
So, I took a bite of a cheeseburger,
and I said,

730
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,505
"Man, this is delicious.

731
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,799
Whoever made this cheeseburger
can suck my dick."

732
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,761
And he goes,
"Man, you must love that cheeseburger!"

733
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,935
I'll tell you,
when I was raising the kids,

734
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,854
I did a lot of stand-up.

735
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:46,316
This is a true story about Microsoft.

736
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,069
They asked me to do the Church Lady
with Microsoft.

737
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:50,529
And... with the dress.

738
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:54,533
I said, "I don't sell out that character.
I don't do that."

739
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:56,618
They told me what they were gonna pay me.

740
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,079
I said,
"I'll get the bitch's dress on right now."

741
00:50:02,707 --> 00:50:05,710
And I'm in this giant arena,
with Bill Gates, in the dress.

742
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:09,005
Ten thousand Microsoft nerds,
and they revere Bill Gates.

743
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:12,342
He's next to me. He's got the thing...
"Okay. Here we go..."

744
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:16,555
And they're leaning in, intense.
The nerds are like,

745
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,100
"Come on, get him, Bill.
They're gonna do a funny skit."

746
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,145
And I just start to ad-lib.

747
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,189
I go...
"Well, well, well, Mr. Bill Gates.

748
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,441
We like ourselves, don't we?

749
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,570
Apparently, we made a deal with the devil.

750
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,489
The devil said we can have $50 billion,

751
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,242
but we have to go through life
looking like a turtle."

752
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,622
The air got sucked out of the room.

753
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,249
That was not a good move.

754
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,087
Bill Gates decides to ad-lib.

755
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:50,547
"I'm not a turtle!"

756
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,637
And I just think I'm on a roll.

757
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,140
"Well, well, well, there we go.
We like ourselves.

758
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:03,268
We make a lot of money
and feel a little superior."

759
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:06,230
And it's just getting quieter and quieter.

760
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,440
I just couldn't read the room.
I'm into the character.

761
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,567
"We made Windows, didn't we?

762
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,777
So we can creep up to the window at night

763
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:14,654
and look at the fornicators."

764
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,622
So, it's getting weirdly dark in there.

765
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,624
I go, "Let's do a superior dance."

766
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:29,586
In the middle of the skit, he goes,
"No, thank you. Goodbye."

767
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,840
I walk backstage. It's a disaster.

768
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,968
It's like Lord of the Rings intensity
back there.

769
00:51:37,051 --> 00:51:39,138
I'm surrounded by Microsoft nerds,
and they're like,

770
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,680
"Oh, my God.

771
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:47,187
You made fun of the precious."

772
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,695
I raised the kids.

773
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,739
I took a little bit of time off
from show business.

774
00:51:57,822 --> 00:52:00,492
And I wanted to be there for 'em,
you know,

775
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:03,620
'cause show business could
just take your whole life and time.

776
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:07,374
There was this famous New York actor
who was gone so much,

777
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,168
his kid was raised by a British nanny,

778
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,128
that the kid developed a British accent.

779
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:15,131
And I always wonder what
that phone call would be, calling home...

780
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,259
"Hey, this is Johnny Stompanato.

781
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:19,844
Is Johnny Stompanato Jr. there?"

782
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,680
"Hello, Daddy!

783
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:27,394
So glad to hear your voice.
It gives me goose pimples."

784
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,355
"Is your mother there?"

785
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:33,358
"Mommy went to Barcelona
with our gardener, Antonio."

786
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:36,236
"Who's watching out for you?"

787
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,614
"Edwina. She's my nanny.
She's from jolly old London.

788
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:42,451
We're going to have a sudsy tub soon."

789
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:47,539
"Yeah. Okay.
Is your little brother Danny there?"

790
00:52:47,622 --> 00:52:51,210
"Yes. Yes, Danny's here,
but he's with his nanny."

791
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,837
"Danny's got his own nanny?
Who's Danny's nanny?"

792
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,257
"Danny's nanny
is the actor Michael Caine."

793
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,052
"What the freak? Danny!"

794
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,722
"Hello, Daddy.

795
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:09,644
My name is Danny Stompanato Jr.

796
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,899
So good to hear your voice, Father."

797
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,819
"Danny, how old are you?"

798
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:20,614
"I'm four years old.

799
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:28,121
Today, my nanny, Michael Caine,

800
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,916
took me to the beach,
and we made sand castles.

801
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,421
And then the waves came,
and they took the sand castles away."

802
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,967
"Yeah, waves will do shit like that
to sand and whatnot."

803
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,888
"And then, we went to the park.

804
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,974
And my nanny, Michael Caine,
pushed me on the swing.

805
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:52,521
And he pushed me higher and higher,
and I went so high,

806
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:57,108
I thought I was gonna go
right over the bloody top!"

807
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:02,947
"Yeah, I'm sorry I haven't been around.
I've been doing a lot of motion pictures."

808
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,199
"That's okay, Daddy.
But come home soon,

809
00:54:05,284 --> 00:54:07,911
so when I come off the playground,
I see my father,

810
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:11,956
and not Academy Award-winning actor
Michael Caine."

811
00:54:18,963 --> 00:54:21,383
"Hey, is your little brother
Johnny there?"

812
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,428
"Johnny's with his nanny."

813
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,888
"Johnny's got his own nanny?
Who's Johnny's nanny?"

814
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:28,765
"Liam Neeson."

815
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:32,143
"Johnny?"

816
00:54:32,226 --> 00:54:34,521
"Now you listen to me, Father.

817
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:38,066
I have skills I've acquired,

818
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:42,111
skills that make me a nightmare
for an absentee parent such as yourself.

819
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,906
If you come home now
and bring me a stuffed animal,

820
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,199
no harm will come to you."

821
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,454
"What kind of stuffed animal?"

822
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,121
"I like hippopotamuses.

823
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:55,124
Would you like to hear a joke, Father?"

824
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,919
"Yeah, sure.
What the fuck? What? What joke?"

825
00:54:58,002 --> 00:54:59,754
"Knock, knock."
"Who's there?"

826
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,381
"Father."
"Father who?"

827
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,759
"Exactly. Now get on home,
you motherfucker!"

828
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:13,059
This is something I just like to do.
I hope you find it amusing.

829
00:55:13,142 --> 00:55:15,687
I love the movie Scarface so much.

830
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,273
And um...

831
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:24,028
All right, this is my fantasy
of Tony Montana, Al Pacino,

832
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,655
having Thanksgiving dinner.

833
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,867
Okay. Thanksgiving.

834
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:30,619
"Pass the sweet potatoes.

835
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,877
Pass the sweet potatoes!

836
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:44,966
You know I like...
You know I like the sweet potatoes.

837
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,887
But I look around the table,
I don't see no sweet potatoes.

838
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:53,391
I see a turkey. I see a green bean.

839
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:56,478
But I don't see no sweet potatoes.

840
00:55:56,561 --> 00:56:00,690
Where the sweet potato
with the marshmallows toasted on top?

841
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,858
I don't see it.

842
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,610
I know who took the sweet potato.

843
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,820
I know who ate the sweet potato.

844
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:08,656
It's that fat bitch over there. Grandma!"

845
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,411
"Oh, yeah!

846
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:15,371
You don't think I see you, man?
I see you all the time.

847
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,749
I look at you. I look at you.

848
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,083
All the time, I watch you, man.

849
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,710
You eat. You like to eat, huh?

850
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,004
You like to eat? You like to eat?

851
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:25,673
You gotta eat. You like to eat. All right.

852
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,968
I'm at a party.
They got a bowl of candy corn.

853
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,889
They got a bowl of candy corn.

854
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:38,019
I go to get a candy corn.
There's no goddamn candy corn.

855
00:56:38,102 --> 00:56:40,564
'Cause you ate all the candy corn.
Okay?

856
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,942
I look at you. I look at you, man.
I see you. I see you eating.

857
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,402
A carrot cake, all right?

858
00:56:46,486 --> 00:56:49,322
I look for a piece of carrot cake.

859
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,701
'Cause there's no candy corn.
So, I go for a carrot cake.

860
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,912
You ate all the goddamn carrot cake.

861
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,123
I look at you, man.
I look at you all the time, man.

862
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,249
At Christmastime.

863
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,628
You got a chocolate.
You want to get a chocolate out of a box.

864
00:57:03,712 --> 00:57:06,631
You pick a chocolate up.
You stick your thumb in the back.

865
00:57:06,715 --> 00:57:09,383
You get a coconut.
You put it right back in the goddamn box.

866
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,640
I go to get a chocolate,

867
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,935
it's like a goddamn war zone, man,
with all the diggin' in the back.

868
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:20,311
'Cause you don't check the guide.

869
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:23,565
You got a Whitman's Sampler.
You got a Whitman's Sampler.

870
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,525
In the lid. In the lid.

871
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,902
You got a guide. You got a guide.
You got a guide.

872
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:31,405
It tells you what a candy is.
It tells you what a candy is.

873
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:34,451
But you don't check the guide.
You don't check the guide.

874
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,035
You just...

875
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,247
It's corresponding. Okay?

876
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,331
You want a Turtle?

877
00:57:40,414 --> 00:57:43,167
You want a chocolate with a nut,
called a Turtle?

878
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:45,253
Or a Almond Roca or whatever?

879
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,714
You can see with the guide.
It say on the lid.

880
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:50,509
But you don't check the guide.
You never check the guide.

881
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:54,971
And you eat all my goddamn candied yams,

882
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:57,223
you son of a bitch!"

883
00:57:59,684 --> 00:58:00,977
That just...

884
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,062
That'll never go on the special.

885
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,316
Thank you.

886
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,946
So last year,
which I found very interesting,

887
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,282
being a huge Beatles fan,

888
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:15,533
Paul McCartney.

889
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:20,830
Paul McCartney made a song
with Kanye West. Okay?

890
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:24,417
And everyone said,
"Hey, he's got his new partner.

891
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,961
He's got his new John Lennon."

892
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,631
And I thought, "I don't know."

893
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,967
Well, it's not that heavy.

894
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:36,846
But, for me, I wanted Paul
to talk to John about it.

895
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:39,683
So that was my flight of fancy.
John, from Heaven, talking to Paul.

896
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,643
"Hello, Paul.

897
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:45,605
Paul, this is John. I heard you made
a song with Kanye West."

898
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:47,691
"Yeah, John. I did. I did.

899
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:51,110
I made a little song
with Kanye West, you know?

900
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,321
You know, I had a little keyboard.
You know?

901
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,699
And I sat down for a pluckety-doo,
you know.

902
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,660
And I was plonking away with him.

903
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,704
And he started hummy-talky-singy,
you know.

904
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,124
And the next thing I know,
we had a real toe-tapper."

905
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:10,338
"Well, what are his lyrics about?
What does he write about?"

906
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,590
"Well, he's, you know...
He's a good guy, you know.

907
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:16,052
It's like, he writes things,
sort of, like, about how great he is.

908
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,805
He's, like, what we used to call
a chest-thumper, you know?

909
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,640
He's a chest-thumper, you know.

910
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,560
Remember when you said
we were as popular as Jesus?

911
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,687
He thinks he is Jesus."

912
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:32,318
"Well, does he have a woman
that inspires him, Paul?"

913
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,613
"Oh, yeah. He..."

914
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,200
"Oh, yeah.

915
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:44,581
He's got a terrific gal
by the name of Kim Kardashian, you know."

916
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,666
"What does she do?"

917
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,965
"Well, really, she's a nice gal.

918
00:59:54,048 --> 00:59:59,053
What she does when she's working
is she takes pictures of her bottom."

919
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,056
"Pictures of her bottom?"

920
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,017
"Yeah, that's her job, you know.

921
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,394
Her job.
She takes pictures of her bottom."

922
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,440
"Well, does she do it with,
a Polaroid camera?"

923
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:12,358
"No, John. In the future,

924
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:15,695
everybody's got a baby television
in their pocket.

925
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:21,242
And it's got a little camera on it.

926
01:00:21,325 --> 01:00:23,286
So when she's at a hotel or somewhere,

927
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,579
she may say, 'It's time to go working.'

928
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:27,916
So she sticks her fanny out,

929
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,376
and she takes her baby television..."

930
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,922
"What's so special about her bottom?"

931
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:37,926
"Well, John, it's not a normal bottom.

932
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,470
It's a prominent bum.

933
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:44,265
It's a bottom 2.0.

934
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:49,312
It's like, God made a fanny
and attached a person as an afterthought."

935
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,650
"So, that's what she does?"

936
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,152
"Yeah, the whole family does it.
They're all...

937
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,154
They're all taking pictures
of their bottoms

938
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,823
with their baby television.

939
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:00,907
They all do it.

940
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,243
One gentleman got so frustrated,
he became a woman."

941
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,546
"Well, what does she do with the cameras?
Does she put 'em in magazines?"

942
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,424
"No, she posts the pictures."

943
01:01:18,507 --> 01:01:20,009
"Oh, on a bulletin board?"

944
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,969
"No... No, John.

945
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:24,931
She posts them
on a thing called Facebook."

946
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,850
"Well, what's Facebook?"

947
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:31,104
"Well, Facebook, John, is a place
where you share your life with the world.

948
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,981
Like, say you're in a restaurant,

949
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,692
and you have
a particularly nice ham sandwich..."

950
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:50,039
"You take out your baby television,
and you take a picture.

951
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:54,293
And you send it to all the other
baby televisions all over the world.

952
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,713
And people can look at your ham sandwich.

953
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,717
And if they like it, they press a button
on the little baby television.

954
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,971
And if you get 100 likes,
you're floating on air for a day or two."

955
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,475
"Well, that's...

956
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,521
That's amazing, Paul."

957
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:16,733
"Well, sometimes,
you get haters and trolls."

958
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,610
"How can you hate a ham sandwich?"

959
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:22,989
"You'd be surprised, John.

960
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:25,825
You know, not enough lettuce,
too much cheese.

961
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,161
You know, the normal things."

962
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,665
"Do they remember us, Paul?"

963
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:35,418
"Oh, they do, John.
They really do remember us, you know.

964
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:39,713
After the year 2000,
we outsold everyone except Eminem."

965
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:42,008
"We got outsold by a candy?"

966
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:45,469
"It's a long story, John."

967
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,224
"Did we ever get ownership
of our music back, Paul?"

968
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,644
"Not exactly. No.
Michael Jackson bought our music."

969
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,355
"Really?"

970
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,649
"Yeah, you may have seen him up there."

971
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,111
"I haven't seen him up here."

972
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,997
"Well, he's changed a little bit, John."

973
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,665
"I did see a white woman trying

974
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,251
to teach Liz Taylor
the moonwalk the other day."

975
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,838
Thank you, guys. You've been awesome.
Thank you.
