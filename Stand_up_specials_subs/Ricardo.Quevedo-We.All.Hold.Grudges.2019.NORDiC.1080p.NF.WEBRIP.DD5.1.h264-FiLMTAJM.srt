1
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,343
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL COMEDY SPECIAL

2
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:12,553
<i>A big round of applause for</i>

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,556
<i>Ricardo Quevedo!</i>

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,557
Hi, everyone!

5
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,437
Thank you very much. You're so nice.

6
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,871
Thank you very much. You're so nice.

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,874
So natural, so kind.

8
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,042
I'm so glad you're here.

9
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,170
I'm always glad, every time I
perform and the theater is packed.

10
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:48,090
I'm glad and I'm worried too.

11
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,550
'Cause there are too many people

12
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,386
and resources are running out...

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,681
There's no room for
us all in this world,

14
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,351
so I very much agree with Thanos,
from the Avengers.

15
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,772
One snap and fuck half of us off.

16
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:05,690
Let's start over.

17
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,358
Yeah, let's start over.

18
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,860
A lot of folk say:
"What if it happens to my family?"

19
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,362
Because it's random, you know.

20
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,115
If it happens to my family, well...

21
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,701
Black Panther died.

22
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,245
Spider-man died.

23
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,330
Priorities, right?

24
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:21,998
Yeah, I mean...

25
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,833
Let's say...

26
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:26,669
your family goes,
and another family's lost a member,

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,546
team up with them!

28
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,089
And move forward,

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,465
so there are fewer people

30
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,718
and we make the most
of our time here.

31
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,805
Many people say it's a
radical solution and all that.

32
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,600
But you don't think the same...

33
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,436
when overpopulation affects
you, you know?

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,355
For example, when you're stuck
in a traffic jam.

35
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,940
Traffic is not the problem

36
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,484
but the annoying
people in traffic jams.

37
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,694
Those people

38
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,280
who are a little bit dumb.

39
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:57,074
Those people who bring out
the murderer in you, you know.

40
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,410
Most of us are bitter,

41
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,370
and that's when you think: "Yes,

42
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,248
there are people who deserve to die,

43
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,001
so the rest of us can move on
and be happy."

44
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,464
Those people who honk the horn
when they're stuck in a traffic jam.

45
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,800
Those people who honk the horn
at a red light.

46
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,053
Why do those people exist?

47
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,262
No, no.

48
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,431
Think of the person
who is first in the line.

49
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,225
You're in your car,
respecting the rules.

50
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,019
You're first in the line of cars.

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,022
The traffic light is red.
You stay still, follow the rules.

52
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,691
Listening to your favourite music.

53
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:33,152
You left early
for the first time in your life.

54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,404
You got paid that day.

55
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,697
You're happy.

56
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,367
And there's a motherfucker honking
the horn behind you

57
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:41,203
and you cannot move.
What do you think?

58
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,246
You probably think: "This man is
in a hurry and I can't move.

59
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,748
I always fuck up somehow.

60
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,249
God, I fuck up all the time.

61
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,044
I won't make eye contact
so he doesn't get angrier.

62
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:53,839
Please, God, put love and patience to
the heart of that person behind me,

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,467
so he doesn't get out of the car
and try to beat me up.

64
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,968
Oh, he got out of the car!

65
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,304
I'll move to the sidewalk!

66
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,263
You don't say any of that.

67
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,723
You get really pissed, right?

68
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,310
Because you don't respond well
to that negative pressure.

69
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:08,312
When someone pressures you,
you don't cooperate.

70
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,189
You don't make an effort to help.

71
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,441
That happens to you at work, right?

72
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,027
When they ask grudgingly,
you don't wanna do it.

73
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,197
Imagine being told at work,

74
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,406
out of nowhere...

75
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,492
"Go and fix that shit!"

76
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Your boss.

77
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:28,165
Yes, sir. No problem.

78
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,418
This son of a bitch.

79
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,377
You feel offended.

80
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,714
You come back and say:
"I couldn't. I'm sorry.

81
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:35,881
I tried, but couldn't."

82
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:40,010
You don't wanna help that person,
right? They've got a bad attitude.

83
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,430
If they treat you badly,
you don't wanna do it.

84
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,349
But when they ask nicely,
you do wanna help.

85
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,019
But not when they are rude, so you're
full of rage in the traffic jam.

86
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,522
The guy keeps honking the horn
and you can't move.

87
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:53,899
You're boiling with rage in there.

88
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,443
"Yes, Thanos was right!

89
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,736
Yes! Yes!"

90
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:59,697
You're so angry that when the
light turns green, you don't move.

91
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,866
You just stay there.

92
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:02,825
You check the time

93
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,578
and say: "I'm early, fuck this guy."

94
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,498
We are all gonna be late, fuck it.

95
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,166
You're in a bad mood.

96
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:12,585
You don't respond well
with that negative pressure.

97
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,671
When someone pressures you,
you don't respond the same way.

98
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,507
I'll give you an example
to prove my point.

99
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,303
Ask your mom to take a picture
with her cell phone.

100
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,847
There's no way that's
gonna end well.

101
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,725
You're a good son,
you give your mom a smartphone,

102
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,019
so she can get up to date,
download her apps,

103
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,146
so she is connected to the world.

104
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,899
The first picture she sends
to the family WhatsApp group

105
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,985
is one of herself
with a massive double chin.

106
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,530
"I learned to take selfies."

107
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,532
She creates a group with your aunts

108
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,702
and they start sharing
that aunt content.

109
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,246
Those low resolution photos,

110
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,124
all pixelated, of
Tweety and Sylvester.

111
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,833
Yeah.

112
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,752
Those chains you get, saying,

113
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,962
"Forward this message from the Pope
to 15 people

114
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,757
and God will bless your week.

115
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:00,634
Thanks for your cooperation."

116
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,803
You only watch one video.

117
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,973
Those videos your mom sends, you watch
the first one and not the rest.

118
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,475
Yeah, you watch the first one

119
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,479
and you don't watch the rest
'cause they make you wanna die.

120
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,691
With sad music and
a voice-over saying:

121
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,444
"He left home one day
without a goodbye to his mother."

122
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,532
The video is like a threat.

123
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,952
That's why that day you're
stressed out, worried, anxious,

124
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:30,788
you call every 15 minutes.
"Mom, have you called the doctor?

125
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,122
Go for a check-up."

126
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,040
Yeah.

127
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,210
So you don't respond well
under negative pressure, right?

128
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,921
Ask your mom to take a picture.
You see she won't take it.

129
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,214
For example,

130
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,926
you go to a bakery
and run into James Rodríguez.

131
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,054
Something that would
never happen to you.

132
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,889
Never. Let's say James

133
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,516
got tired of living in Germany

134
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,477
and bought an apartment
opposite yours.

135
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,021
You go to the bakery on Sunday
and James is there,

136
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,148
wearing shorts, flip-flops,
with his daughter,

137
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,818
buying <i>Arepas</i> for breakfast.

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,152
You go in with your mom and say,

139
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,071
"It's James Rodríguez, mom! Now!

140
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,656
Grab my phone, take a picture!

141
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,033
James, sorry to bother you.
Just a quick picture.

142
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,744
Mom, quick, take the picture
before more people come,

143
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,204
before the police take him,

144
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,416
before James leaves.
Mom take the picture!

145
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,001
And she remains like this.

146
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,380
She puts her glasses on.

147
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,800
You try to smilingly give her
instructions. "Mom,

148
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,596
don't be nervous, mom.
Pay attention.

149
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,389
It's easy. I left the camera ready.

150
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,599
Just touch the screen.

151
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,100
Touch the screen, it's done,

152
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:36,312
James leaves, I'm happy ever after.
Mom, don't do this to me, please.

153
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,105
Just touch the screen, please.

154
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,356
"I can't see the button."

155
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,943
Listen, mom, pay attention.

156
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,278
One thing at a time. Look at me.

157
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,115
I am here. Yes, ma'am.
Your son, you gave birth to me.

158
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,282
Touch the screen.

159
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,618
Touch the screen. Take the picture.
That's it.

160
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,702
Everybody's happy.

161
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,704
James probably has things to
do, mom,

162
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:54,998
for God's sake.

163
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,334
Yes, Mr. James, that's my mom.

164
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,920
So beautiful. Yes,
you have to be patient with them.

165
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,086
Yeah, so beautiful.

166
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,756
Touch that fucking screen, mom!

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,841
James has to go.

168
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,258
Just touch it.

169
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,555
"Now I see myself."

170
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:12,807
Mom, I'm telling you

171
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,558
touch the center of the screen.

172
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,354
You switched to selfie mode.
Why do you do that to me?

173
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,688
Touch the screen.

174
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,149
- I took a selfie.
- Mom!

175
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,486
It makes you wanna throw a tantrum
like when you were a kid, right?

176
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,239
I have a theory that moms like
to photograph the floor.

177
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,575
There's something about a floor
that seduces them, intrigues them.

178
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,912
They wanna investigate it,
they take pictures of it.

179
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:37,582
They take you a picture and you know
it's not good from the start.

180
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,710
The flash is on
and she points the cell phone down.

181
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,421
And she takes a
picture of the floor.

182
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,676
I showed my friends the picture.
"Guys, this floor tile

183
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,261
was from the day I met James
Rodríguez. Just imagine..."

184
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,098
We all have a video on our phone.

185
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,935
A ten-second video of you and a
friend staying still like this.

186
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,692
Done?

187
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,319
No, I'm not gay.

188
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,323
Touch the screen.

189
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,492
The last two seconds
you approach the camera,

190
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,495
"Maybe it's reco..."
and the video finishes.

191
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,454
There's no room for all of us.

192
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,373
And people get crazy
when they drive.

193
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,458
You don't respond well
to negative pressure.

194
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,752
You like to follow the rules,

195
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,504
but it's so hard to use turn signals

196
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,507
'cause that means warning the enemy.

197
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,175
As soon as they see you indicate,

198
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,178
they pull up to the next car

199
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,470
so as to not give way.

200
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,348
There are people who enjoy it.

201
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,850
And they say so to their passengers.

202
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,769
"I won't give way to this moron.

203
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,189
Ha ha! Look at that asshole
in the car on the left.

204
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,152
He's been wanting to turn for six
blocks, no one lets him. What a shame!

205
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,612
He's furious.
He's cursing to himself.

206
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,824
Look at his face now. Fooled ya."

207
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,410
Why are we like that?

208
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,537
We have to give way to people.

209
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,080
We are very rude in traffic jams.

210
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,250
We curse everyone, we are mean.

211
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,667
Right?

212
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,212
You insult everyone
from the safety of your car.

213
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,213
Right?

214
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,048
But you keep the windows closed,

215
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,216
'cause you're not stupid.

216
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:13,218
You wanna insult everyone, but...

217
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,263
you never know who
you're dealing with.

218
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,265
So you're in your car cursing,

219
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,059
and a taxi crosses the street,

220
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,311
and makes you slam on your brakes,
and the taxi driver looks

221
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:24,856
at the rear-view mirror,
and sees you like this...

222
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,194
But if the taxi driver
gets out of the car

223
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,488
and knocks on your window...

224
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,950
You roll it down and say,
"We almost crashed, buddy.

225
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,662
I suck at driving. It's my fault.
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,122
Hey, this city is full of Ubers."

227
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,793
In this case,
you think twice, right?

228
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,670
But there's no room for all of us.

229
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,381
And I think that deep
inside we know that

230
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,884
and that's why we put
ourselves at risk every day.

231
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,679
Unconsciously we put our
lives at risk in order to die.

232
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,099
For example, when you're lying
in bed, looking at your phone.

233
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,936
You know where I'm going, don't you?

234
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,481
Why do we make such
stupid decisions?

235
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,067
I'm about to fall asleep.

236
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,195
I'm gonna check my phone
and put it near my face.

237
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,697
What could go wrong?

238
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:57,739
You drop it on your face.

239
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,325
That hit wakes you up.

240
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,537
It's so dangerous for people with
glasses. They could break them.

241
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,831
You wake up with a black eye,

242
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,456
what do you say in the office?

243
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,501
"I was just clumsy,
checking my phone?"

244
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,005
No, you have to make something up,
like, "Some morons tried to rob me."

245
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,093
Those little things that make
us feel stupid every day, right?

246
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:20,095
Those things that show us
that we haven't learned how to live

247
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,013
in this world.

248
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,973
When you brush your teeth
in the morning.

249
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,474
Something as simple as that.

250
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,976
You brush your teeth too hard,

251
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,771
and hit your gums
with the toothbrush.

252
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,815
The pain is bearable.

253
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,568
That doesn't hurt, it hurts thinking

254
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,905
that you're over 30 and you haven't
learned how to brush your teeth.

255
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,239
That's so sad.

256
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,076
That cupboard door in the kitchen
that you leave open,

257
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,077
and you forget it's open.

258
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,998
You start doing other things,
like doing the dishes, cooking...

259
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,208
Then you forget it's open...

260
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,667
Boom! Right in your forehead.

261
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,753
Your forehead turns red
and starts to throb.

262
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,880
That doesn't hurt.

263
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,633
It hurts knowing you were the one
who left that door open.

264
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,510
Knowing you're setting traps
for later in your safe place...

265
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,722
that deep inside you hate yourself
and wanna die.

266
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,266
Those kind of things. Those windows,

267
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,435
those large, clean windows.

268
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,437
You don't see them
and walk through them.

269
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,190
That happens to clumsy people.

270
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,857
It happened to me many times.

271
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,610
You walk through it and boom!
That doesn't hurt.

272
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:19,947
What hurts is the stupid instinctive
reaction you have afterwards.

273
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,783
You've just hit your head.

274
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,494
And your reaction is this...

275
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,832
You have to check there's actually
something your head hit,

276
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,918
yet it's hurting.

277
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:35,420
Those little things make
us feel stupid, don't they?

278
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,673
The paving flags on the city streets

279
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,132
which are loose.

280
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,302
When it rains,
they fill with mud underneath.

281
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,014
You're walking happily along,
you just had a bath.

282
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,140
You step on them and...

283
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,143
Boom! One leg is covered in mud.

284
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,231
You're so angry, you wanna step on it
again and cover your other leg in mud.

285
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,149
You wanna fall down.
Yeah, whatever.

286
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,859
I'm covered in fucking mud.

287
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,362
I'm too stupid to walk!

288
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,408
Those little things you let pile up
and make you blow up.

289
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,160
We put our lives at risk every day.

290
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,870
Doing sad, pathetic things.

291
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,748
Like when you choke
on your own saliva.

292
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,001
That's so sad.

293
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,504
Come on, how can you choke
on your own drool?

294
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,758
And you're there, all red, coughing,
about to drop dead.

295
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,926
Humiliated.

296
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,346
When you recover, you think,
"Hey, I could have died."

297
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,434
Choke on your own saliva,
what a sad, pathetic way to die!

298
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,772
They say that more than four people
die every year, choking on saliva.

299
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,566
I always thought the
figure was higher,

300
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,737
the thing is that the family doesn't
want to admit the cause of death.

301
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,196
You say a few words at the wake,

302
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,615
"He was just standing there,

303
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,242
in the park, and...

304
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,911
he gulped and...

305
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,624
We thought he had learned,
he was 37 years old."

306
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,171
Those little things
that make you feel stupid.

307
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,714
Those little things.

308
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,674
People with braces, for example.

309
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,759
When a wire sticks out

310
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,510
and hurts your mouth.

311
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,803
It's awful! Frustrating!

312
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,640
Oral health is very important.
Dental health, I mean.

313
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,225
Right? It's very important.

314
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,645
Oh! You understood
something different.

315
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,147
Okay, it's alright.

316
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,983
Everyone has different priorities.

317
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,234
Everyone.

318
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,235
The thing is that...

319
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,446
I hate going to the dentist,

320
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,782
because it's like taking your car
to a mechanic.

321
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,535
You go to fix a specific problem

322
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,704
and he finds a thousand other things
you had no idea about.

323
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,500
You get depressed and think,
"I must sell that piece of shit."

324
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,669
And you're in that awkward position,

325
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,962
with your mouth open.

326
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,880
Humiliated.

327
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,424
Some dentists talk to you.

328
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,718
If there's a dentist
watching, please,

329
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:46,927
don't do that.

330
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,679
You don't wanna be rude,
so you try to reply.

331
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,307
And it's so sad. You're there...

332
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,016
"Yes, sir.

333
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,979
Sociable chatter.

334
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,856
Yes.

335
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,401
Fourth semester.

336
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,902
Yes.

337
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,155
Sociable chatter."

338
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,657
"Spit."

339
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,910
"Yes, I was saying... Oh, sorry.

340
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,453
Chatter."

341
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,206
I once went
to have my wisdom tooth removed.

342
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,499
It's so painful, right?

343
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Awful.

344
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,002
The dentist was a beautiful woman.

345
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,504
She had the most amazing eyes,

346
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,549
and she was looking at all that
rotting in my mouth. I had no idea

347
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,384
my mouth was like that!

348
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,177
I brush my teeth every day.

349
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,555
And there I was, humiliated.

350
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,766
And she was talking to her assistant
about me... in front of me.

351
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,603
As if I were a piece of furniture.

352
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,689
So sad.

353
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,858
"Look, he has cavities.

354
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,025
Yeah.

355
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,944
Yes, I have to start tooth decay
treatment. Write it down."

356
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,196
I'm like, "Yes, ma'am.

357
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,490
Okay. What about my wisdom tooth?"

358
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,366
"We already checked that.

359
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,909
But look, his teeth are stained.

360
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,411
Too much coffee, or he smokes.

361
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:58,165
Write down teeth whitening,
gum contouring surgery."

362
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,333
"okay, yes, ma'am.

363
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,210
And my wisdom tooth?"

364
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,878
"We already checked that.

365
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,672
Look, he has a bad bite.
I think he needs braces.

366
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,676
Not for too long, but we must start
the treatment, write it down."

367
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,051
"okay, yes, ma'am.

368
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,012
The wisdom tooth?"

369
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,847
"We already checked it.

370
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,974
Half a million for the braces,
the other..."

371
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,685
Doing the numbers in my face.

372
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,563
And I'm squeezing my butt,
I wanna go home!

373
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,148
I have other priorities.
I have no money.

374
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,066
You get depressed and
tell your friends,

375
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,319
"Guys, I have cavities.

376
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,947
My teeth are stained
and I have to wear braces."

377
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,659
- "And your wisdom tooth?"
- "That was the best part of my mouth."

378
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,495
I just left it there.

379
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,872
You can't be that ungrateful. I can't
have the prettiest part removed.

380
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,500
I'm proud of it, even if it hurts."

381
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,629
But I mentioned braces, right?

382
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,298
When a wire sticks out,
and you hurt yourself,

383
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,052
you can take the pain, but let's
say you're kissing someone.

384
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,387
And you hurt that person,

385
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,930
you feel embarrassed.

386
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,681
Regardless of the braces,

387
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,185
the real problem is,
some people don't know how to kiss.

388
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,522
I wasn't gonna mention that today,
but I think it's important.

389
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,941
Learn how to kiss shit.

390
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,402
I mean, "learn how to kiss, comma."

391
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,324
The importance of the comma.

392
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,744
Don't take it so literally. Okay.

393
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,328
I mean,

394
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,455
we've all had that kind of kiss,

395
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,165
a kiss with no chemistry.

396
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,625
The kiss which was like

397
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:26,086
two pieces of jigsaw puzzle
that don't fit together.

398
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,338
And you were trying
to make them fit.

399
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,091
That kiss you had been waiting for.

400
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,260
You think, "Yeah, it may work out,"

401
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:35,304
and after the kiss,
"No fucking way!"

402
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,432
I think extremes are not good
when you're kissing.

403
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,811
One extreme is people who open
their mouth too wide.

404
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,980
Those people who wanna eat
you, but...

405
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,566
not in a cool way,
they wanna devour you.

406
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,068
They wanna process you,
get you inside their body.

407
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,613
Those people who overdo it, like...

408
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,283
After the kiss you say,
"No, I'm busy tomorrow.

409
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,160
No, I think I'm leaving the country.

410
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,330
I think I'm gonna change my number."

411
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,876
It's like when you teach a kid
how to color.

412
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,503
Right?

413
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,380
You say, "There are some lines.

414
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,051
Let's respect those lines,

415
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,678
and have fun inside them!

416
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,764
Let your imagination fly!"

417
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,225
Some people never
learned how to color.

418
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:25,521
They color outside the lines, they put
their tongue in your cheek. Awkward.

419
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,357
I think the other
extreme is even worse.

420
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,444
People who barely open their mouth.

421
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,237
Those who kiss like this...

422
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,032
Their lips are tense,
they don't open them

423
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,992
so nothing can get
inside their mouth.

424
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,995
And your tongue tries
to get in somehow.

425
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,582
Yes, here! Oh, no, that's a tooth.

426
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,337
So, as they don't open their mouth,
you look like the one doing...

427
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,049
I think the coolest kiss
is the one where you just fit,

428
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,468
you don't even have to ask.

429
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,928
But I was talking about those things

430
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,846
that make you feel stupid.

431
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,891
I remember that once
I kissed a girl,

432
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:05,018
a long time ago, who had a...

433
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,313
a loose wire on her braces
and she hooked me here.

434
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,066
It was like a hook in my mouth.
I was like, "Oh, God.

435
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,567
Oh, my God, what should I do?"

436
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,570
She hadn't even
noticed, she was like...

437
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:19,033
I said, "This is what fish feel.
Fuck!

438
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,785
No, no, no.

439
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,953
Just chicken and meat,
starting tomorrow.

440
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,706
No, no, I mean it.
That's just cruel."

441
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,792
She was happy,
she hadn't even noticed.

442
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:31,003
Those little things make
us feel stupid, right?

443
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,921
Like voicemail, for example.

444
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,257
With cell phones,
it is easy to feel stupid.

445
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,634
This is good advice.

446
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,638
If you're gonna leave a message
longer than two minutes, just call.

447
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,307
We're tired of the
never-ending voicemail.

448
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,685
You see eight minutes.
Nobody's got time for that!

449
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,688
I have other things to do. Yeah.

450
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,606
An eight-minute voicemail.

451
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:54,276
And you have no way out,
'cause they ask, "Do you agree?"

452
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,985
Fuck off.

453
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,823
Or when you're sending
a voice message,

454
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,158
and you're busy talking
shit about people,

455
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,953
and then you realize you weren't
pressing the right button.

456
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,665
You were pressing an imaginary spot
on your cell phone.

457
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,333
You can't be bothered
to start again.

458
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,794
"I'll tell you when I see you."

459
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,296
Which is what you should have done
in the first place, right?

460
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,133
So there's... in
WhatsApp, for example,

461
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:21,219
with couples, there are things
that make us feel stupid.

462
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,471
Some people argue with themselves
in WhatsApp.

463
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,434
Some people get mad,
break up, make up.

464
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,644
And the other person hasn't read
any of it.

465
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,147
Those who have a lot free time,

466
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,899
while the other person is busy.

467
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,902
Let's say she messages him one day
at 2 p.m.

468
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,445
Hi, boo.

469
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,824
All cheesy and in love,
"Hi, boo. How are you?"

470
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,118
Two minutes later, "Busy?"

471
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,997
Two minutes later, "Yeah,
you must be busy. Talk later."

472
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,791
Two minutes later, "Let me know
when you have a minute."

473
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,918
Two minutes later, "Now? LOL."

474
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,507
Two minutes later,
"Sorry, I won't bother you again."

475
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:02,595
Two minutes later, "When you're
finished, wanna tell you something."

476
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,848
Two minutes later, "You're
gonna crack up, let me know."

477
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,601
Two minutes later,
"Don't ignore me, it's not nice."

478
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,146
Two minutes later,
"Is it gonna be this way? Okay."

479
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,776
Two minutes later, "What bitch
are you with that you can't reply?"

480
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,570
Two minutes later,
"That flirty bitch from the office?

481
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,655
Think I don't know?"

482
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,534
Two minutes later, "If you're
cheating on me, you're a rat."

483
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:31,248
Two minutes later, "I read it all
and overreacted. I'm sorry."

484
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,294
Two minutes later, "I'm apologizing
and you don't give a fuck."

485
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,465
Two minutes later,
"Is this how it is? Great."

486
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:43,052
Two minutes later, "Too bad
things have to end this way."

487
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,722
Two minutes later, a song,
"Come back" by Don Omar.

488
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,935
After all that bullshit,

489
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,189
you say, "Honey, I was taking
a shit. I didn't think..."

490
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,026
She says, "But you were in there
for half an hour." Yes.

491
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,237
'Cause now we have cell phones.

492
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,864
Some women are very wary of
men, and say,

493
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,075
"He went to the bathroom
with his cell phone.

494
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,118
Who knows who he's talking to."

495
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,869
That's bullshit!

496
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,205
You go to the bathroom
with your phone

497
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,165
because you want to be informed.

498
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,001
It's the only place in this world
where no one will bug you,

499
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,129
where you can take the time you need
to read whatever you want.

500
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,800
You hold your poop in
until you've read everything.

501
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,176
"There was a Champions League game.

502
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,179
Let's see the scores."
You read happily.

503
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,849
"Oh, Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off.

504
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,516
Red card.

505
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,644
And what about the Real Madrid?"

506
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:37,689
The human body is wise,

507
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,942
it gives us signals
to help us know things.

508
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,445
What's the signal to let us know we've
been taking a shit for too long?

509
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,697
Your leg gets numb.

510
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,364
Right?

511
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,867
Yeah, you stand up and think,

512
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,868
"No!

513
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,579
How much time did I stay here?

514
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,914
That can't be true!

515
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,876
I have a real problem.
I should see a therapist."

516
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,505
Those little things make
us feel stupid, right?

517
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,756
Those misunderstandings
with your partner.

518
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,551
Nowadays, it is very hard

519
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,927
to maintain a good relationship,

520
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,430
because they tend to be shorter
than before.

521
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,682
So people who are in a relationship
right now

522
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,435
should know that
it's gonna end soon.

523
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,729
I'm not being bitchy

524
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,357
nor do I wanna jinx you, guys,
but it's gonna end.

525
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,067
Look at the person you love

526
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,652
for three seconds.

527
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,987
That person you love,

528
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,655
who you're in love with,

529
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,742
look them in the eye
for three seconds.

530
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,036
That person is gonna fuck up.

531
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,079
That person is gonna fuck up.

532
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,831
Everything's gonna end.

533
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,207
You'll remember me and say,

534
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,126
"That guy told us and I cracked up,

535
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:42,003
instead of working
on my relationship."

536
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,257
Relationships don't last like
they did, like our grandparents',

537
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,633
which lasted for years,

538
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:49,802
and they put up with anything
so they could be buried together.

539
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:53,014
Not anymore.
Everything is fucked way too easily.

540
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:54,183
Because of a mere like.

541
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,435
It may end because of a like.

542
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:57,518
Right?

543
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,104
I speak from what I see.
And what I see in relationships

544
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,482
is that usually the problem lies
in communication.

545
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,944
'Cause neither of them wants to be
the annoying one,

546
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,654
the pain in the ass, right?

547
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,657
So they hold in
the things they don't like.

548
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,491
They don't say what bothers them.

549
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,577
But it doesn't go away, it piles up

550
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,411
over the years,

551
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:19,083
and then you blow up and drag up
things that happened two years ago.

552
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,709
Those little things.

553
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,963
Some people expect too much
from their partner.

554
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,463
That's another problem.

555
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,006
They expect too much. Okay?

556
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,509
Women, for example, expect us to do

557
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,511
those little things

558
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,638
on our own initiative.

559
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,973
Like when they say,

560
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,184
"I think he will realize and do it."

561
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,814
Please don't have faith in us.

562
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,232
We're thinking about some bullshit

563
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,150
that is not important,

564
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,154
we are definitely not thinking
about what you're thinking.

565
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,030
She says,

566
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,242
"He's gonna see the dirty dishes
and wash them."

567
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,412
She's waiting for you to do it.

568
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,872
"Yeah, it also smells
when he passes by,

569
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,917
he's gonna realize
and then he'll wash them."

570
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,793
Nope. That's not gonna happen.

571
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,712
Probably,
if they asked you to do it,

572
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,797
you'd say, "I'll do the dishes.
No problem."

573
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,799
But they don't ask you.
They're waiting.

574
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,677
So you don't do it,
and they get mad.

575
00:25:13,262 --> 00:25:15,430
They don't tell you
they're mad at you either.

576
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,933
Because you, on your own initiative,
should know

577
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,519
that she's in a bad mood,
'cause you know her.

578
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,063
So while one of us thinks
the relationship is going well,

579
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,441
the other's about to break up.

580
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:28,360
It's very easy to fuck up.

581
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,486
With a present, for example.

582
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,197
Men are more relaxed
when it comes to presents.

583
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,658
Because, I mean...

584
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,743
they give you anything
and you're happy

585
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:38,829
because it's some shit
you didn't have. Period.

586
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,414
On your birthday,

587
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,250
"Honey, a purple belt. Beautiful!

588
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,334
Thank you so much. A purple belt.

589
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,462
This purple belt you
gave me is so pretty!

590
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,463
It goes with...

591
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,467
Well, this purple belt is beautiful,
anyway,

592
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,218
and I promise you
I'll find a special occasion

593
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,096
to wear the purple belt you gave me
with such love.

594
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,723
I love you. Thank you so much!"

595
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,310
And you find a special occasion
to wear the purple belt.

596
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:04,520
"Honey, October 31, Halloween,
I'll wear the belt.

597
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,438
I love you.

598
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,066
It goes well with my costume.
I love you. Thank you.

599
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,359
I'm the life of the party."

600
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,488
Now, giving her a
present is quite harder.

601
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:13,906
'Cause she lies.

602
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,450
See? Some women here are angry.

603
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,159
But it's true.

604
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,369
She lies. She says,

605
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,288
"I'm super-relaxed.

606
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,209
It is so easy to make me happy."

607
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,672
That's bullshit, and she knows it.

608
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,884
"I like simple things."

609
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,428
Guys who are watching,

610
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,097
just try this out,

611
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,100
give her a handwritten poem
for her birthday.

612
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,019
I'll tell you what's gonna happen,

613
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,939
she'll see it and wait
for something else.

614
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,866
Thank you, honey.

615
00:26:58,367 --> 00:26:59,660
Thank you, so beautiful.

616
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,745
Yeah, look, your feelings.

617
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,751
She doesn't say anything to you,
but she tells her friend,

618
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,546
"How can he be so stingy?

619
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:14,049
I paid 400,000 pesos
for that purple belt!

620
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,552
I saw Maluma wearing it.

621
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,931
A parchment? Is this what our
relationship is worth for this asshole?

622
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,267
No one thanks you.

623
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,684
It's so hard.

624
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,478
"I like simple things.

625
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,689
I like shoes."

626
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,440
But what they really mean
by "I like shoes"

627
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,318
is "I like shoes, but...

628
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,028
not high heels 'cause I get tired.

629
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,490
Why would I want shoes I can't wear? I
have like, four pairs of high heels.

630
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:42,577
I don't want flats either, I'm not
a grandma who can't wear heels.

631
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,787
I need shoes in vivid colors,
I'm a young woman.

632
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,623
But not too bright, I'm not a whore.

633
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:51,043
No dull colors either. I don't
wanna look sad and depressed.

634
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,213
I'm a happy person. I need
shoes that convey that message,

635
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,631
'I wanna take on the world.'

636
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,136
But I want to keep the distance
from people looking at my shoes..."

637
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:02,388
While she's thinking
about all that bullshit,

638
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,389
you're thinking,

639
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,017
"Sports shoes.

640
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:07,978
I'm gonna surprise her."

641
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:12,024
Your arguments for buying shoes
are very different.

642
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,819
You're in the shoe store and
say, "okay,

643
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
sports shoes

644
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,657
with a thick sole
so they last longer.

645
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,117
These are hiking boots.

646
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,077
Yes! So she can get
in and out of mud

647
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,913
without slipping. That's perfect!

648
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,749
And in pink,
'cause they're for a lady."

649
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,920
The salesman looks at you,
"He's gonna fuck up, big time."

650
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,924
"Don't you want to see other models,
other colors?"

651
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:38,842
"No, no. I know her."

652
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,347
There's a sad moment that both men
and women have experienced,

653
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:46,850
when you realize
they didn't like your present.

654
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,518
That never-ending minute

655
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,022
when they hold it,
and they don't try it on.

656
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,524
They don't even look at it.
"Thank you."

657
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:56,985
And you're there
squeezing your butt.

658
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,988
"She didn't like it.
Should've given her a poem."

659
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,740
And...

660
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,909
And to get out of
that awkward moment,

661
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,369
you say something even worse.

662
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,413
"I have the receipt,
if you wanna change it."

663
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:11,082
It's... it's so hard.

664
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,375
It's so hard to agree.

665
00:29:12,376 --> 00:29:15,002
'Cause men give other
kind of presents, okay?

666
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,089
You have other arguments
on what is a useful present.

667
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,550
You think, "What can I buy her
for her birthday?

668
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,678
A coat. A winter coat.

669
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,721
I hate when she puts my jacket on
when she's cold,

670
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,100
and I freeze like a jerk. A coat.

671
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,809
"Honey, look, a winter coat,

672
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,061
and it's my size."

673
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,066
They love wearing our
clothes, don't they?

674
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,401
I guess this happened to many men.

675
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,321
One night, she comes out of the
bathroom with a T-shirt you like,

676
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,157
and tells you,
"Honey, I wanna sleep in this one."

677
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,369
Would you mind?" You say you don't.

678
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,039
But you think,
"Oh, it's gonna be full of bobbles."

679
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,959
She's sleeping next
to you in your bed,

680
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,336
and you can't sleep.

681
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,588
"She moved, another bobble."

682
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,633
Yeah. It's the T-shirt you like.

683
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:03,843
A winter coat.

684
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,803
"Baby, a winter coat.

685
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,721
I love you."

686
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:07,764
She says, "Thank you."

687
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,683
"Don't you like it?"

688
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:12,476
"Yeah, yeah, it's very nice,

689
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,479
for a special occasion."

690
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,650
And the occasion is never special
enough to wear the fucking coat.

691
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:22,446
"Honey, it's your nephew's birthday.
You can wear the coat."

692
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:27,658
"It's too special a coat to wear
to a mere birthday party.

693
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,911
We always have birthday parties, Let's
save it for a special occasion."

694
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,829
"Okay, then."

695
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,416
"Honey, it's your uncle's wedding.
You can wear the coat."

696
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,710
"It's just that the
coat is too casual.

697
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,378
Don't you think? It's like..."

698
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:41,006
"You didn't like that fucking coat.

699
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,175
Give it to me, I'm gonna give it
to a starving kid

700
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,553
and he can eat it or change it
for something else."

701
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,222
She really pisses you off.

702
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,808
And she says, "No, it's not that.
I can't go to a wedding

703
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,228
in a Millonarios F.C. coat,
it's not appropriate."

704
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,358
"But it's from the last championship
we won. Wear it with pride."

705
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,822
It's easy to fuck up.

706
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,533
In WhatsApp chat,

707
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,743
men and women see different things

708
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,162
of the same conversation.

709
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:15,248
For example, she messages you
at 2 p.m. saying, "Hi, love."

710
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,044
You see the message half an hour later.
You reply as soon as you see it.

711
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,922
"Hi, love. How are you?" Just that.

712
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,384
You see she's online
and not replying.

713
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,845
You don't worry about it.
She replies later,

714
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,305
"What are you up to?"

715
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,724
"Fine, love, I'm home.
What about you?"

716
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,144
She replies, "Fine.
Fine, kind of bored.

717
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,895
No plans for today.

718
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:39,523
There's not much to do."

719
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,943
You say, "You're chilling at home.
Cool."

720
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,031
You think it's nice.

721
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:51,367
You think, "She worked all week,

722
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:52,326
today is Saturday,

723
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,955
I hope she goes to bed early
and sleeps in on Sunday."

724
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:57,082
But she doesn't think so.

725
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,877
She says, "Wanna go to the movies?"
You reply, "Yes, honey! Sure!

726
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,753
Let's watch <i>The Conjuring!</i>

727
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,296
What a great movie!

728
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,714
It's scary. It'll be awesome!

729
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,175
What time does it start? Where?"

730
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:08,677
She says, "Oh, that one.

731
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,637
At 6 p.m., at the mall."

732
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,973
"okay. See you there."

733
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,600
For you,
the conversation ends there.

734
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,687
You start getting ready
to see the woman you love.

735
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,439
She's about to break up with you.

736
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,483
But she says nothing to you.

737
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,692
She tells her friends,

738
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,944
"What's up with this guy?

739
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,571
He's MIA all fucking day.

740
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:31,323
I had to put my pride aside
and text him, 'cause yesterday

741
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:33,325
I texted him too,
and there are two of us.

742
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,494
It should be one time each,

743
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,246
'cause we're both in love, I guess.

744
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,457
But the stupid girl who puts
her pride to aside

745
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,749
messaged him again.

746
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,085
He takes ages to reply,

747
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,670
and I have to reply quickly

748
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,173
or he gets mad.
But I, the secretary,

749
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:50,218
have to be available around
the clock for that jackass.

750
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,011
I started giving him clues,

751
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:54,014
to see if he picks up on it one day.

752
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,640
Like telling him I'm
bored, that I'm free,

753
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,185
that I have nothing to do, no plans,
and he tells me,

754
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,854
'You're chilling at home. Cool.'

755
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,316
What the hell is he thinking?

756
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,609
How do I have to say it?
I feel pretty,

757
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,486
I wanna go out with him!

758
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,447
I take the initiative for the
15th time and ask him out.

759
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,532
He chooses a shitty movie
that I don't like,

760
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,367
he doesn't even ask for my opinion.

761
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,661
I can't even go to the
kitchen at night for water

762
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,581
and now I have to
watch <i>The Conjuring!</i>

763
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,377
And on top of that, he says
he'll meet me there!

764
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,796
What happened to the gentleman
I once knew?

765
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,799
Who picked me up, who cared
how I was gonna get there.

766
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,177
Now I have to take a bus
where people touch you,

767
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,263
to meet this asshole
who doesn't give a fuck!"

768
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,099
Meanwhile, you're on your way
to the mall, happy.

769
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,978
You have no idea about
all that bullshit.

770
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,523
You're on your way
thinking how you love her.

771
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,652
Women, I will explain what happens
on a man's mind.

772
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,695
We have a lot of brain cells working
in there.

773
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,864
Like all human beings.

774
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:54,615
But there's one brain cell

775
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,867
which is in charge
of not letting you

776
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,244
fuck up your relationship.

777
00:33:58,245 --> 00:34:00,247
That's its only function.

778
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,915
Not to fuck up your relationship.

779
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,251
But that brain cell is about to die.

780
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,710
That brain cell is
in intensive care,

781
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,713
its days are numbered.

782
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,091
So when the other cells come and ask
something important,

783
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,345
that brain cell replies some
bullshit to get out of trouble.

784
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,556
That's what happens to your mind.

785
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,723
The other cells ask,

786
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,518
"Do you think we
should pick her up?"

787
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,979
That brain cell replies,
"She'll get there."

788
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,899
That's what happens to your mind.

789
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,403
But it's easy to know
when they're angry.

790
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,864
'Cause when women are angry,
they reply with one word.

791
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,575
And normally, they are talkative.

792
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,286
I mean... yeah.

793
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,871
If she speaks little,
something's wrong.

794
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,250
"Are you getting
ready, love?" "Yes."

795
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:50,213
"See you soon then." "okay."

796
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,927
"Oh, my God, when did I fuck up?

797
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,306
What day is today?
Did I forget our anniversary?

798
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,809
Maybe I cheated on
her and I don't know.

799
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,605
Maybe she saw I liked some boobs
on Instagram.

800
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,648
Oh, my God!

801
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,650
I can't be that stupid!

802
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,735
I have to do what this guy told me,

803
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,947
like the boobs pic, and seven football
players pics, so it gets lost."

804
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,493
And you stress out
thinking when you fucked up.

805
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,912
It's easy, guys,
just follow the clues.

806
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,038
Follow the clues.

807
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,458
We use social media
to let it all out,

808
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,835
to say what we think.
Log in to Facebook.

809
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,546
Go to her profile.
She wrote something like,

810
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:34,966
"They fuck up and then you have to
explain to them what they did wrong."

811
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:36,593
What a nerve!

812
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,304
And the hashtag, #raisingkids."

813
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,435
And 15 likes from her friends and
family who already know what happened.

814
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:49,356
You see that and think,
"Maybe something happened at work."

815
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,359
You don't have a clue.

816
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:54,152
And you fuck up even more.

817
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:58,198
You open Instagram and you see
she posted a quote picture.

818
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,284
"When you expect too much
from the people you love,

819
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:02,911
and they let you down,

820
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,997
it makes you understand,
only count on yourself."

821
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,042
And you like it.
"What a good phrase.

822
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:11,961
What book is she reading?"

823
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:14,673
You don't have a clue.

824
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:25,141
You fuck up even more
and you don't realize.

825
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,934
Right? It's...

826
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:30,312
It's easy to realize,
but you don't pay attention.

827
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,899
You go to meet her and you're late.

828
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,818
Raise your hand if
you're always late.

829
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:36,903
Come on, be honest.

830
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:39,364
Be honest. Most of you, see?

831
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,866
I'll be the voice of the latecomers

832
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,577
and we're going to apologize
to punctual people.

833
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,996
We know it sucks to wait for others

834
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,707
when you are a punctual person.

835
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,168
If we said at 8, we meet at 8.
That's it.

836
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,253
You don't have to wait for others.

837
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:56,839
In favor of the latecomers,
I'll explain something.

838
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,425
It's not that we wanna be late,

839
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
we feel ashamed.

840
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,137
We feel sorry.
We don't wanna be late.

841
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,471
We don't wake up and say,

842
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,307
"I'll be late, I don't give a fuck
about other people's time.

843
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,145
They have to wait for me,
'cause I'm a diva. Beyoncé and I."

844
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,981
We don't say that.

845
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,232
We don't say that.

846
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:17,818
We feel ashamed. The problem is
that we miscalculate time.

847
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,946
We plan everything to arrive early.

848
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,366
But those plans are designed
for punctual people.

849
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,286
They'd be useful
for punctual people,

850
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:30,622
but we lie to ourselves with our
plans 'cause we don't stick to them.

851
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,166
We have a meeting at 8 a.m.,

852
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,669
and the night before, we think,
"I'll wake up at 6 a.m.

853
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,671
okay, 6:30 a.m.,
that should be fine.

854
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,632
I think I'll have plenty of time.

855
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,802
I can lie down for ten minutes,
check my phone.

856
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,013
Five minutes to take a shower,
five minutes to get dressed.

857
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,600
Three minutes to eat something."
We're just not like that.

858
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:51,311
The following day, we lie down

859
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,563
for half an hour and we fuck up.

860
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,940
Sometimes, we are lying in bed

861
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,610
consciously fucking up.

862
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,863
We know we're fucking up
and we don't do a thing about it.

863
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,031
We just stay still.

864
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,744
"Fuck, I'm gonna be late."

865
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,371
But we don't get up.

866
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,622
We stay there.

867
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:16,669
"I'm gonna get fired."

868
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,339
And we just hide under the covers.

869
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,132
We look at our watch and say,

870
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,761
"It's 6:35 a.m.
I'll get up at 6:42 a.m."

871
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,934
Then we say, "There's no way
it's been seven minutes."

872
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:34,520
"okay, 6:45 a.m."
And we keep putting it off.

873
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,898
Sometimes we leave the house
at the meeting time.

874
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:40,609
I overslept once.
The meeting was at 8 a.m.

875
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,694
and I was still snoring.

876
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,112
The phone ringing woke me up.

877
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,697
I answered half asleep, "Hello?"

878
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,700
"We're waiting for you, man.
What happened?"

879
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,327
I said, "I'm almost there."

880
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,205
With that silence around me,

881
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,248
with that sleepy voice.

882
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,375
"I'm almost there."

883
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,087
"We're calling your
landline, asshole."

884
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,175
At least come up with a better lie.

885
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:07,512
"It's a long cord."
You don't know...

886
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,765
You don't know how to lie
when you just woke up.

887
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,017
You're late.

888
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,603
She's mad at you.
And she has every right to be mad.

889
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,146
She's furious. You're late.

890
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,149
After everything you've done.

891
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,818
You're late, and she says, "Look,

892
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,069
you missed the trailers,

893
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,656
the movie's started
and we can't buy anything to eat.

894
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,825
You say, "No, I brought popcorn.

895
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:31,786
And I put sausages too."

896
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:34,831
You think that's nice.

897
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,125
Popcorn that is now cold,

898
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,211
all greasy and gooey,

899
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,546
you may think that's nice.
When you made it,

900
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:44,549
you thought it was a good idea.

901
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:49,511
But she thinks you're too stingy
to buy food at the cinema,

902
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,681
and that her purse will smell like
shit because she has to carry it.

903
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,516
You can't go in with
a bag of popcorn,

904
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,395
feeling proud about it.
"I make them." No, no.

905
00:39:58,021 --> 00:39:59,898
Honey, let's sneak
them in in your purse.

906
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,859
You're watching the movie,

907
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,528
happily eating cold popcorn.

908
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,197
And she's about to
break up with you.

909
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,490
But she says nothing.

910
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,493
It piles up until it explodes.

911
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,411
And when she says all that bullshit,

912
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,040
you say, "I had no idea our
relationship was that bad."

913
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,499
So...

914
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,043
the relationship ends.

915
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,711
The problem is

916
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,256
that men and women
react very differently.

917
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:28,759
Let's say that women have
a more loyal social circle.

918
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,928
When she's sad or she's ended
a relationship,

919
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,387
her family looks out for her,

920
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,681
"We know you're sad,
we're here if you need us.

921
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,517
We are here for you.

922
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,186
You just have to call."

923
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,979
When her friends hear
about the break-up,

924
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,356
they go to wherever she is.

925
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,650
"Fuck that asshole.

926
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:47,569
He doesn't deserve you. He's
an idiot. We knew he'd fuck up.

927
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,406
We never liked him. We didn't
tell you 'cause you were in love.

928
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,867
But we don't like him.
And we always knew it.

929
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,702
Fuck him! You're gonna dress up,

930
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,788
you'll look great
and we'll go for a drink.

931
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,791
We don't need men to be happy.
Fuck them!"

932
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,295
When she's single again,
there's like five...

933
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:07,381
motherfuckers who've waited a while
for that opportunity,

934
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:08,298
there,

935
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,760
like raptors hiding,

936
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,387
waiting for their chance,

937
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,473
checking social media for new prey.

938
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,643
She writes on
Facebook, "Love sucks."

939
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,523
They all come at the same time,
commenting,

940
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:25,023
"Are you alright?"

941
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,483
"Do you need to talk?"

942
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,361
"Do you need a shoulder to cry on?"

943
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,780
"Let's drink tequila,
it's not that strong."

944
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,409
But not your friends,
they're bad people.

945
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,869
That's why they're your friends.

946
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,789
Your friends are pervs.

947
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,833
Your friends use you as an excuse

948
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,877
to do things they've been
wanting to do for a long time,

949
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,381
but didn't do
'cause they didn't get the chance.

950
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,800
So you tell them, "I'm sad,
I broke up with my girlfriend."

951
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:53,635
"To the brothel! You need to relax,

952
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,304
you need to... yeah."

953
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:58,016
But you don't wanna go.

954
00:41:58,141 --> 00:42:00,393
"No, you need to get over her."

955
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,270
I'll admit I feel awkward
in those situations.

956
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:05,105
I'm shy in those situations.

957
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,566
When I've been to bachelor parties
and that stuff,

958
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,276
it's like I don't know what to do.

959
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:11,611
So I talk to some girl
and make her laugh,

960
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,322
and then, we're like, "What now?"

961
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,868
Paying and all that
makes me feel awkward.

962
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,536
When you're shy in those situations,

963
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,580
you have a friend

964
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:22,373
who is a bad influence.

965
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,585
That friend women silently hate.

966
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,253
Women know which friend that is,
don't you?

967
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,422
The one you've silently hated
for a long time.

968
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:33,717
You can't say you hate him out loud
'cause you'd be in trouble.

969
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:34,969
But it's that friend.

970
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:36,679
That bad influence.

971
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,348
You say, "Oh,
you're going out with... Ah.

972
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:41,434
Have fun."

973
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,396
But you're thinking, "That son
of a bitch leads him astray."

974
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,608
The friend who knows you're shy
in the brothel,

975
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,570
and he's there, "Put your boobs
in his face to see what he does."

976
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,908
You're there, "I don't think
this is the right way."

977
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,370
You're drunk,
your friends make you drink.

978
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,790
Then, that sad moment comes,

979
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,083
which all resentful guys go through,

980
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,251
the drunk dial.

981
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:10,420
That phone call we make when drunk
and regret the day after.

982
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,673
It was even worse
when cell phones didn't exist.

983
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,050
You called the landline.

984
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,427
Her father picked up
and it was a disaster.

985
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,972
Now you call her cell phone,
and she can divert the call,

986
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,183
or ignore it.

987
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,559
Yeah, whatever.

988
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,685
So you have to send a voice message.

989
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,686
Drunk voicemail.

990
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,322
"This is a message...

991
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,533
'cause...

992
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,921
you don't pick up the phone...

993
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,050
you, doctor.

994
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:02,306
You're too important

995
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:06,435
to pick up the phone at 4:35 a.m.

996
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,022
You're doing doctor stuff.

997
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:13,984
Alright.

998
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,321
Yesterday you called me boo.

999
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,994
Now I'm just some motherfucker.

1000
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,375
No, young lady.

1001
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,128
Things don't work that way.

1002
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,090
I invested in some
sports shoes for you,

1003
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:38,718
with a durable sole!

1004
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,347
For mountain climbing, forest stuff.

1005
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,225
You never put them on.

1006
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,647
You showed contempt.

1007
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,445
The Millonarios F.C coat...

1008
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:01,824
rotting in your closet.

1009
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,287
And I'm wearing this
fucking purple belt.

1010
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,919
That's the way it is.

1011
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:17,256
I... I chopped a sausage.

1012
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,010
I invested my money...

1013
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,763
so we could do something nice.

1014
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:27,016
I chopped it fine.

1015
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:30,268
She's all about fitness now.

1016
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,146
I soaked up the grease
with paper towels.

1017
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,775
I do something nice...

1018
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,405
She says, 'How could you sneak
popcorn into the cinema?

1019
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,616
How could you sneak popcorn?

1020
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:45,992
They sell popcorn here.

1021
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,995
Shame on you! So rude!'

1022
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,164
Showing contempt.

1023
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,877
If I'd put in fried plantain,
she would have freaked out.

1024
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:08,391
'How could you sneak popcorn
into the cinema?

1025
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,810
That's so rude. That's...

1026
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,312
Stingy. They sell popcorn here.'

1027
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:15,940
It's the same popcorn.

1028
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,819
Or did the cinema popcorn go to Uni?

1029
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,156
That's why it's more expensive.

1030
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,158
Probably.

1031
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,460
The cinema popcorn
is more important.

1032
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,380
It has a degree...

1033
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,216
in sweet and salty cuisine.

1034
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:45,927
That's why it's more expensive.

1035
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,972
'How could you sneak
popcorn into the cinema?'

1036
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:51,182
Don't eat it, then.

1037
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:58,816
If you wanted me to pick you up
to go to the movies,

1038
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,735
you just had to say it.

1039
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,947
But no! The fucking mentalist...

1040
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,325
the fortune-teller

1041
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,910
will get inside your brain

1042
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,080
and he will find all those...

1043
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,583
questions, thoughts, and situations

1044
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,044
that you expect in
your relationship.

1045
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,212
No, you're not stupid."

1046
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,716
Fuck, I'm not recording.

1047
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,928
Let's start all over again.

1048
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,937
Let's start all over again.
"Two, three.

1049
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,229
Checking.

1050
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,397
Two, three.

1051
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,485
No, young lady!

1052
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,116
I recorded a voice message
and accidentally deleted it.

1053
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,204
I'm gonna recap and continue.

1054
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,248
I gave you sports shoes,
you never put them on.

1055
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,460
The coat from Millonarios F.C.
is rotting.

1056
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,797
The sausage-chopping situation.

1057
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:07,009
Oh, I brought popcorn to the movies.

1058
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:11,013
The popcorn from the
cinema has a degree.

1059
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:14,850
Mentalist situations.

1060
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,104
That's where we left off.

1061
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,610
You're single, so you go out

1062
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,612
with those witches,

1063
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,614
who never liked me.

1064
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,451
They let me into their social circle
with so much hypocrisy.

1065
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,579
'Hello. How are you?'

1066
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,582
They always hated me.

1067
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,127
You're happy, drinking.

1068
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,671
And you post stories.

1069
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,841
You never post a fucking
video or picture.

1070
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,718
There you have it,
500 stories drinking.

1071
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,388
With your hashtags.

1072
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,266
Just because it's Friday.

1073
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,018
<i>Taki Tara taki.</i>

1074
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,024
<i>Guaro, Perico, Popper,</i>
sex situations.

1075
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:08,154
Partying hard.

1076
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,490
You're there drinking tequila,

1077
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,993
with five motherfuckers
I don't know.

1078
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,580
Happily twerking to <i>Scooby Doo Papa.</i>

1079
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,626
And I'm all depressed in a brothel.

1080
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,839
Then she finds out,

1081
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:30,258
and says, 'Oh,
you were in a whorehouse.

1082
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,218
You were in a whorehouse.'

1083
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,596
Showing contempt.

1084
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:38,601
No, they have talent.

1085
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:43,022
Everyone hones their
talent as they wish.

1086
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,732
I was talking to Sharon,

1087
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:46,984
and she told me

1088
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,778
about her children's dreams.

1089
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:53,199
Little Michael wants to sing
reggaeton. That's great!

1090
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,534
Who are we to judge?

1091
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,703
Everybody develops their art...

1092
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,247
We have to respect that.

1093
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,459
Some people say at a young age,
'I'm good with numbers'

1094
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:05,044
They become engineers.

1095
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,212
Some say, 'No, no,

1096
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,423
I build things,

1097
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,592
and I assemble them. Architect!

1098
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:15,679
Some have their
talent in their pussy.

1099
00:50:17,932 --> 00:50:18,932
That's okay!

1100
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,851
Who are we to judge?

1101
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,987
Who are we to judge
the Lord's decisions?

1102
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,783
He gives talents
to different body parts.

1103
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,076
That's alright.

1104
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,581
She's pretty, so she's there
with all her friends.

1105
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,123
But I'm ugly.

1106
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,418
I have to do what fishermen do.

1107
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:47,544
Throw the net!

1108
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,672
And whatever I get...

1109
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:53,717
Sometimes I get boys,
and I say, 'Oh, no.

1110
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,053
I'm vulnerable,

1111
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:58,013
confused, maybe I fuck up.'

1112
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,100
With all the respect

1113
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,228
gay people deserve. Everyone

1114
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,022
gets love wherever they want.

1115
00:51:08,691 --> 00:51:09,691
It's alright.

1116
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,734
Diversity.

1117
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,735
Respect.

1118
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,031
We can be friends.
You like it in the ass, I don't.

1119
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,825
It's not an obstacle
to our friendship.

1120
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:22,162
We can respect and love each other.

1121
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,581
Even if I'm not gay.

1122
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,167
Well, there was this time
in high school...

1123
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,587
But it was a game, truth or dare,

1124
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,007
and I dared... those motherfuckers.

1125
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,845
They made me kiss a friend
who I didn't even find attractive.

1126
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:42,016
He didn't know how to kiss.
He barely opened his mouth.

1127
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:45,436
I wanted to French kiss him
and he didn't let me.

1128
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,523
He has a wife now.
That belongs in the past."

1129
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,068
The following day,
you see a voicemail

1130
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:54,653
16 minutes long.

1131
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,697
And you don't remember
what you said.

1132
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,700
With two blue ticks,
so she's listened to it.

1133
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:02,243
"Oh, what did I say?

1134
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,411
Let's hear a bit.

1135
00:52:03,412 --> 00:52:05,122
'The popcorn has a degree...'

1136
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,710
What the hell was I thinking?"

1137
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:12,712
And relationships end.

1138
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,506
Let's think about that moment
when relationships end.

1139
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,967
That argument you have in public.

1140
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,554
When you argue with your partner in
public, we've all gone through that.

1141
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,555
Yeah,

1142
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,808
that moment when you're pretending

1143
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,643
to fight, so no one realizes.

1144
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,188
But everybody realizes
because it's obvious,

1145
00:52:29,313 --> 00:52:31,315
and it is hard to hide your anger.

1146
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,025
After you insult each other,

1147
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:36,028
after everything you've said,

1148
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:37,779
there's silence.

1149
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,822
You stay there,
waiting to see what happens.

1150
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,242
You're mad, but you can't leave
'cause it'd be worse.

1151
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:45,453
If you leave, there's no way back.

1152
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:46,497
You stay there.

1153
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,374
And she's in her soap opera moment.

1154
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:49,666
She wants to cry,

1155
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,960
but she doesn't want
people to see her.

1156
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:54,962
She tries to hold back her tears,

1157
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,382
but fails, because she's sensitive

1158
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,385
and she can't hide her sadness.

1159
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:02,429
And that's not bad.
She just doesn't want to be seen.

1160
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,306
So she says those lines...

1161
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,352
"Okay.

1162
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:13,816
Everything's clear now.

1163
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:22,449
We all make mistakes.

1164
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,547
I just hope that you..."

1165
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,761
find someone that...

1166
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,138
She's not crying yet,
but you fuck up and say,

1167
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:46,682
"Come on, don't cry. Calm down."

1168
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,560
Shut up, bro. Leave her alone.

1169
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,685
Right?

1170
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:53,063
And she says, "No, I won't cry.
Relax. I'm fine.

1171
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,482
I'm not sad anymore.

1172
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:58,152
I won't make a show.

1173
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:01,446
A scandal."

1174
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,999
She puts her hand on her nose.
I didn't know what that was for.

1175
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,294
Since I was a kid,
I thought it stopped you crying.

1176
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,630
When my parents told me off,
I went to my room like this.

1177
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,717
Crying my heart out,
"This is not working."

1178
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,722
You know when they cry like this?

1179
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,975
You don't know if they laugh or cry,
you can't see their face.

1180
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,603
Once my ex girlfriend was like...

1181
00:54:33,312 --> 00:54:34,270
And I was like...

1182
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,271
"okay, no, no."

1183
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,486
You don't know what to do,
and you're so mad,

1184
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,447
that in that moment of rage
you use a very rude phrase

1185
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:46,575
many women say when
they're mad at a man

1186
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:48,410
all around Latin America.

1187
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:49,828
"Go eat shit."

1188
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:53,373
She's overreacting.

1189
00:54:53,499 --> 00:54:55,208
That's not the way.

1190
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:56,335
You know she's mad,

1191
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:59,463
but it's not that bad,
we have to be coherent.

1192
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:02,591
Then she's happy again,
and you already ate shit. Not fair.

1193
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,426
It's different when
a friend says it.

1194
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,138
He says it in a friendly way,
in other tone,

1195
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:10,432
laughing, "Go eat shit."

1196
00:55:11,475 --> 00:55:13,811
As if he was singing, dancing,
he says it with love.

1197
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,605
You even consider it, "Shall I go?

1198
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,234
I don't wanna be rude.
Everyone, come join me!"

1199
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,361
But it's different when she says it.
She wants to offend,

1200
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,823
so she crosses her arms,
and there's anger in her eyes.

1201
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,366
Like this.

1202
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:29,618
Grinding her teeth in anger.

1203
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,327
"Go eat shit!

1204
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,746
A lot of shit!"

1205
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,747
That angry.

1206
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:36,958
"Eat shit!

1207
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,836
Eat a lot of shit!"

1208
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,920
So it's not enough eating shit,

1209
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:42,798
you have to eat a lot of it.

1210
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:46,468
Some of them say "a mountain."

1211
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,139
A mountain of shit.

1212
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,267
Why that much?

1213
00:55:54,977 --> 00:55:58,564
Why not a pound, a spoonful?
That's disgusting enough.

1214
00:55:58,856 --> 00:56:00,190
"A mountain of shit!"

1215
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:03,025
A girlfriend once said,
"Know what, Ricardo?

1216
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:04,778
Go eat a mountain of pasties."

1217
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,362
"Pasties?

1218
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,407
Okay. Thank you."

1219
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,702
"Yes, but full of shit!"

1220
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:16,622
So not only do you have to find
a mountain of shit,

1221
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:20,085
but you also have to buy pastry
to make pasty and eat it.

1222
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,464
You're full up on two, three shit
pasties. What do you do with the rest?

1223
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,050
That's not a successful business.

1224
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:29,051
"Shit and oatmeal pasties.

1225
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,013
I have some spare
ones from last time."

1226
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,389
I like to make you laugh
about this

1227
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,683
for one simple reason,

1228
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,810
the things I talk about in my shows

1229
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,020
are those that happen
in everyday life

1230
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,480
and we get angry or sad about them.

1231
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:45,235
And when I talk about
them in my show,

1232
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,444
people laugh.

1233
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,695
That's what humor does.

1234
00:56:47,696 --> 00:56:51,116
It helps you relax, you sleep better
at night if you've laughed, right?

1235
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,369
And I promise you
that at some point next week,

1236
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,705
you'll remember some joke
I said here today,

1237
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,082
and you will laugh again.

1238
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:02,710
And you'll want to tell the joke
to someone else.

1239
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,963
And you'll fuck up,
'cause you don't know how to.

1240
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,840
And that person will
think I'm not funny

1241
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,843
and fewer people will come
to my shows.

1242
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,011
Thank you very much!

1243
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,847
I'm happy you've come tonight!

1244
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:15,848
Thank you!

1245
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:18,852
Thank you very much!

1246
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,776
Thank you! Thank you so much!

1247
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:28,487
Thank you so much!

1248
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,196
Thank you!

1249
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:32,658
Thank you!

1250
00:57:34,034 --> 00:57:35,034
Thank you!

1251
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,746
Bye! Thank you very much! Take care!

1252
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,623
See you soon!
Thank you so much for coming!

1253
00:57:40,624 --> 00:57:41,624
Bye!

1254
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,877
Thank you! Thank you so much!

1255
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:50,424
Thank you! Take care!

1256
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,426
Bye!

1257
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,139
