00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:34,434
<i>Girls and boys,
please welcome to the stage</i>

2
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:36,737
<i>Sarah Silverman!</i>

3
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,476
Hi.

4
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,421
Well, thank you.

5
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,565
Thank you so much.

6
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,833
I am so happy you guys are here.

7
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,770
I'm sorry about the metal detectors.

8
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:13,073
That is my bad. I, um...

9
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,544
tweeted something,
and, uh, it made some people

10
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:21,281
feel the need to express, um,
wanting to kill me.

11
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,517
And...

12
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,787
I'm sorry I called for a military coup.

13
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:30,123
I knew it was a long shot.

14
00:01:32,526 --> 00:01:36,863
You know, when you're a comedian now,
you really have to think things through

15
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,533
before you post them,
you know, on Twitter.

16
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,702
Who do we think we are, presidents?

17
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,177
Oh. Not necessary.

18
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,812
But appreciated.

19
00:01:53,547 --> 00:01:55,616
I'm, uh... I'm not a fancy person.

20
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,184
I don't, um...

21
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,319
You know, I'm wearing a onesie.

22
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:06,526
I'm not... I have friends
that love jewelry, and I love them.

23
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:11,164
But I... I don't really understand
the value of jewelry at all.

24
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:15,135
That said... I love a nice hotel room.

25
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,738
I need a soaking tub.

26
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,306
So, I have my things.

27
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,341
And I was just on the road,

28
00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:24,845
and I got to stay
in some really nice hotels.

29
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:30,717
And, um, I'll never complain,
because I'm so afraid of being, like,

30
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,286
a complaining Jew.

31
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,158
Which is a stereotype.

32
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,698
Based on facts and patterns.

33
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:48,235
And then, like,
deducing from those patterns.

34
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:51,805
Why are you selling out
your culture, Sarah?

35
00:02:51,872 --> 00:02:53,206
Sorry.

36
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:56,877
Did it get a laugh? Yes. Okay.

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,315
Um... But I did call down.

38
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:04,918
And I was like,
"Everything is so amazing.

39
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,486
Thank you so much.

40
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,388
Um, but I...

41
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,426
noticed there seems to be, um...

42
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,897
semen on the...

43
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,800
I think it's called a duvet.

44
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,802
And... Or a comforter.

45
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,970
And also, um...

46
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:28,708
There's also some on,
like, the nightstand.

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:35,449
And, um, also, I noticed
there's come all over my tits. It's...

48
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,519
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,490
I just, you know, if there's a...

50
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,492
I hate to complain.

51
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,295
If there's an upgrade to be had,
I would...

52
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,797
in I'd take it."

53
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,900
Can you hear me
when I just talk like this?

54
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,301
This is a good
sound system.

55
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,648
You can hear me
when I just talk like this?

56
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:04,678
I, uh, got laser hair removal.

57
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,012
And...

58
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,915
Did you just applaud that?

59
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,617
You're like, "Finally."

60
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,787
I got laser hair removal.

61
00:04:13,854 --> 00:04:16,690
I waited a really long time to do it.

62
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:20,460
Uh... I wanted the science
to be at its peak.

63
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:26,800
You know, like, we landed on Mars...
I think it was August 2012.

64
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,641
Are you just impressed
that I remember the date?

65
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:37,744
What I'm saying is...

66
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,882
we landed on Mars in 2012.

67
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,917
I waited four more years.

68
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:51,525
And then I looked up
the highest-rated laser hair removal place

69
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,593
within three blocks of my apartment.

70
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,661
And I went there.

71
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,298
It was called LaserAway.

72
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,466
And, um...

73
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,736
it wasn't what I...

74
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,705
I think I was naive,
and I just thought you go,

75
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:09,342
and you get... And your hair gets removed.
But it's a much longer process.

76
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,946
For every section of hair
you want removed,

77
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:17,584
you have to go
have eight separate sessions,

78
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,052
you know, like on each...

79
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,690
So, for me, I was doing, like,
from right below my belly button

80
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:25,425
down to the floor.

81
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,395
And then back up
to about the middle of my back.

82
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:32,098
And, um... Isn't that funny
that that's funny? And it's a lie.

83
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,600
I did my arms, too.

84
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,769
But, um...

85
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,738
I can't lie to you guys.

86
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,539
I can't.

87
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,410
Uh... Right.
So, they make you pay up front.

88
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,112
Which makes so much sense,
now that I think about it.

89
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,516
Because... it hurts so much.

90
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:54,054
By the second session you're like,
"Oh, I would gladly pay $3000

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,957
to never come back here again.
That would be a bargain."

92
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,058
It's so painful.

93
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,660
And I have a...
I feel like I have a high pain...

94
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,731
I think most women
have a high pain threshold.

95
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,868
I've been punched in the face thrice.
And that's another story for another time.

96
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:09,935
But I...

97
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,940
It's a different kind of pain.
It's like nerve ending...

98
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,007
Like nerve damage.

99
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:18,712
Like, they give you stress balls,
and you squeeze them.

100
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:22,382
And by the time
you pry your fingers open,

101
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:26,553
they're just, like,
pyramids of powder, basically.

102
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,422
It hurts so much.

103
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:33,426
I remember telling myself like,
"You are a grown woman.

104
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,062
That is your money to waste.
You earned that money.

105
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,131
Throw it out the window.
It doesn't matter."

106
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:43,870
And, uh, as I was walking back to my car
after the second session...

107
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:48,642
I actually can remember exactly,
like, the words I was saying to myself

108
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,644
as I was walking to the car. I was like:

109
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,747
"What you just went through was trauma.

110
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,485
That was traumatic."

111
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,122
And right in that moment
I got a text message from my boyfriend,

112
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,758
who was in Guatemala at the time
with UNICEF.

113
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,861
And it just said...

114
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,797
It said, "I just spent the morning

115
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,733
with a woman
who watched her son get murdered."

116
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,104
And I was like, "You think that's bad?"

117
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:20,006
'Cause I have...

118
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,846
I have a hard time with perspective.

119
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:30,784
Like, I don't gain it
with experience, I guess.

120
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:37,757
I was walking around
here in Los Angeles, judging people.

121
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,027
And that's not me being my best self.
I'm not proud of it.

122
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,862
But that was just the scenario.

123
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,198
And I remember just thinking,
like, "You fucking...

124
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:49,869
petty, small-minded, materialistic twats.

125
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,071
You do not get it."

126
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,606
With their, like, $1500 purses.

127
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,608
It's a bag. It holds shit.

128
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:56,977
Get a backpack. You're silly.

129
00:07:58,011 --> 00:07:59,980
You know? I'm like,
"You don't even get it.

130
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:03,850
We're breathing egos,
acting like we aren't a speck of dust

131
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:07,120
on a speck of dust on a speck of dust
hurtling through outer space.

132
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,187
We're nothing."

133
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,890
And then in the very next moment
I'll be like:

134
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,226
"I want my face on money."

135
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,229
I really do.

136
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:21,735
I feel like I deserve...
I want my face on money, period.

137
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:22,801
I just...

138
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,606
I want my period face on money.

139
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:27,607
It's like:

140
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,142
No, it's more stoic. It's like:

141
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,022
Aw, I just heard my sister laughing.

142
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,125
She's dead.

143
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,194
No, she's here. I'm kidding. She's here.

144
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,805
I, um... I had a dog for many, many years.

145
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,307
And he was my best friend.

146
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,843
And I was always talking to him.

147
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,679
Whenever I was home,
I was talking to him.

148
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,284
And then he died,
and I stopped talking to him.

149
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,551
Makes sense.

150
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:16,322
Or does it? I don't know.
I mean, does that really make sense?

151
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,226
He's just as much a part
of the conversation now...

152
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,864
in a box on my desk.

153
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,203
I stopped... This is what it is.

154
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,940
I stopped talking to myself
because there wasn't a dog in the room.

155
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,007
That's crazy.

156
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,346
So, now I have a new dog, Mary.

157
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:42,649
I, um... I rescued her.

158
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,217
Or I like to think she rescued me.

159
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,619
I don't know which is the less cunty way
of putting it.

160
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,622
But I have her.

161
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,794
And she is my world.

162
00:09:55,228 --> 00:09:58,364
And, uh, I love her so much.

163
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,632
She's my everything.

164
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:01,334
She's young, and she's full of life.

165
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,336
And she's obsessed with squirrels.

166
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,948
And she's kind of gotten me into it, too.

167
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,708
And she's just, like, such a cuddler,
and we play.

168
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,310
And we, like, spoon at night, and...

169
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:15,348
I'm just gonna put a pin in that
for a second and double back and say...

170
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:21,054
that squirrel line, I would call that,
in comedy, a throwaway joke.

171
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,656
I knew it was gonna get a laugh
when I said:

172
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:26,759
"She's obsessed with squirrels,
and she's kind of gotten me into it, too."

173
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,131
But you just keep going to that main joke.

174
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,333
That's a throwaway joke.
It makes it extra cool.

175
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,937
Now I've ruined it 'cause I doubled back
and, like, I'm, like, talking about it.

176
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,004
Now it's ruined.

177
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,107
It's not a throwaway joke anymore.
But it was.

178
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,843
This is probably for two people
in the audience,

179
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,013
but I would say
a throwaway joke is cool...

180
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:50,049
the way that it's cool, like...

181
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:53,920
I play basketball.
If you, like, during a pickup game,

182
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,022
you make, like, a sweet three-point shot,

183
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,058
and then afterwards, you don't smile.

184
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,896
You just go right back into defense.

185
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,232
That's the same coolness
of a throwaway joke. All right.

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,435
So... Really?

187
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,171
That's never gotten a laugh before.

188
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,041
Well, you didn't have to undo it.

189
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,043
Keep laughing.

190
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,078
So, um...

191
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,415
The truth is,
I am... I have gotten into squirrels.

192
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,851
And now I'm gonna get you into squirrels.

193
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,019
I'm not kidding.

194
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,153
Wait until you see.

195
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,056
I learned a fun fact about squirrels...

196
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,960
that I'm so excited to tell you.
I can't... I'm...

197
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,896
Okay, this is what it is. It's this.

198
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:39,799
Squirrels...

199
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,272
cannot find 80 percent
of the nuts they hide.

200
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,810
Are you kidding me?

201
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,382
Is that the greatest thing
you've ever heard in your life?

202
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,355
First of all,
animals aren't supposed to make mistakes.

203
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,190
But secondly...

204
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:07,427
I made this realization
that is gonna blow...

205
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:11,197
Hold your skulls in, because your brains
are gonna fucking explode.

206
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,902
That's how trees are planted.

207
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,770
Are you fucking kidding me?

208
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,176
That's how trees are planted.

209
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,446
God, or the universe,
or nature, or whatever the fuck,

210
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:29,515
created this anxiety-ridden...

211
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,053
paranoid cokehead...

212
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:37,757
that thinks that everybody
wants their acorns.

213
00:12:37,824 --> 00:12:39,425
Nobody wants your acorns.

214
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,197
No one else in the world eats acorns.

215
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,263
Only you.

216
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,935
That they hide them everywhere.

217
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,405
And then they're so fucked up on coke...

218
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,845
they can only find two out of every ten.

219
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,350
Squirrels plant trees.

220
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,020
In Israel.

221
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,822
Right. That I added.
That's not true. I added that.

222
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,496
So, Mary is my dog.

223
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,231
And I love her.

224
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,833
And she got me into squirrels.

225
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,437
And she's young,
and she's full of energy. But...

226
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,173
she's dying...

227
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,878
in that, it's out there.

228
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:38,484
It might be in two weeks.
It might be in 12 years.

229
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:42,422
But it's out there,
and it's looming over me.

230
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,890
And my heart can't take it.

231
00:13:43,956 --> 00:13:46,359
I made a mistake.
I shouldn't have gotten another dog.

232
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,426
It's too much.

233
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:53,398
I'm...

234
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:56,836
Don't judge me.
I'm gonna put her to sleep now. I just...

235
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,874
I need it to be done.

236
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:10,316
And you know what? In my defense...

237
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:13,186
in the scope of history...

238
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:18,291
whether she dies tomorrow when
I put her to sleep, which I'm doing...

239
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:24,597
or she dies naturally in 12 years,

240
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,967
it's not even a blip
in the scope of history.

241
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,302
It's the same exact time.

242
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,038
So, I'm right.

243
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,105
And I...

244
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:38,411
And she won't die in vain,
'cause I'll crucify her.

245
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,481
Oh, my God. How cute would that be?

246
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,517
I didn't tell you, she's little,
and she's got, like, long legs.

247
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:48,454
And, like, her feet kind of naturally
do that thing anyway.

248
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:52,325
And then like:
Oh, I would have to break her arms.

249
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,227
I would.

250
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,463
Listen, if you wanna be a legend,
you've gotta suffer.

251
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:03,336
You think Jesus would be famous
if we put him down like a household pet?

252
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,403
No.

253
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:07,407
Jesus, son of God...

254
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:09,976
died for your sins...

255
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,547
uh, in his sleep
while surrounded by his favorite toys?

256
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,183
That's ridiculous.

257
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,687
I'm gonna... Okay.

258
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,222
I'm gonna be indulgent...

259
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:26,526
and tell a story that's just a true story.

260
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:31,397
Um... It's about one of my sisters.
I have three sisters.

261
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,033
This is about one of them.

262
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,003
Um... I won't say which one. But...

263
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,238
her name is Jodyne.

264
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,044
Um, Jodyne went to Boston University.

265
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:49,348
And if you're familiar with BU,
they have coed dorms.

266
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:52,084
Which most universities have now. Um...

267
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:56,456
But they have coed bathrooms
in the coed dorms.

268
00:15:57,523 --> 00:16:02,028
And Jodyne, uh, got the drunkest
she had ever been her freshman year,

269
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,362
like so many freshmen do.

270
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:11,237
And she stumbled back to her room,
and she managed to get her, uh, jeans off,

271
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:15,408
you know, and just passed out
in a T-shirt and underwear.

272
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,046
And a few minutes later,
the room started spinning.

273
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:24,684
And she ran to the bathroom,
and she started throwing up.

274
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,252
And she's vomiting.

275
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:30,389
And while she's vomiting, she can feel

276
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,227
that somebody
is tugging her underwear down.

277
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,531
But she couldn't turn around
or stop it, um,

278
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:40,633
because she was throwing up so hard.

279
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:46,038
And she's vomiting and vomiting,
and they're tugging her underwear down.

280
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,307
It's going down,
all the way down to the ground.

281
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,478
And she finally finishes throwing up,

282
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,248
and she whips her head around
to see who's there.

283
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,517
But she didn't see anybody.

284
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:00,686
Because she had been shitting herself.

285
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,170
That's... That's a true story.

286
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:25,511
I'm gonna say...

287
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,216
Like, I would call that a relief laugh.

288
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,286
Or, like, a release laugh.

289
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,090
I know that I'm your show.

290
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:41,060
But you have to understand,
like, you're my show.

291
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:44,297
And you were so beautiful.

292
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,799
You were so... You had so much empathy.

293
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,568
You were so worried.

294
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,237
You could hear a pin drop in this story.

295
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,706
It was so nice.

296
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,608
And, you know, I understand.

297
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,410
You thought she was gonna get raped.

298
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,446
And she thought she was gonna get raped.

299
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,151
She thought she was about to get raped.

300
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,820
And I've really thought about this.
And I...

301
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:14,293
I think this may be one of
the only scenarios where you can look down

302
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,729
at a pair of underwear...

303
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:19,164
just:

304
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,401
Just filled with your own shit...

305
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,673
and think, "Oh, thank God.

306
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,308
Oh, my God.

307
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,514
Oh, literally, yay."

308
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:44,690
My sister came to visit me.

309
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:48,561
Not the "shitting in her pants" sister,
but the, um... My oldest sister.

310
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,896
Although, I'm sure she's shit her pants.

311
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:56,369
She's a Silverman, after all.

312
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,641
Uh, no, this is my oldest sister, Susie.

313
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:03,175
She is a rabbi.

314
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,611
She lives in Jerusalem.

315
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,781
Um... "Oh, my God, a godless comedian

316
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:12,852
and, like, a total God-person rabbi
are sisters?

317
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:16,322
What must that be like?" is something
you can muse about in the car.

318
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,625
So, Susie came to town.

319
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:23,663
And she said, "Sarah,
I'm meeting my friend Amber tomorrow."

320
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,865
And then she told me all about Amber.

321
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,900
She's like, "Amber is so amazing.

322
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,236
She was born and raised in Ethiopia.

323
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:32,905
She single-handedly
ran an orphanage there.

324
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,540
She's so inspiring.

325
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,475
I'm meeting her tomorrow at 8 a.m.

326
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,277
Can we use your apartment to meet?"

327
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,379
And I said, "Of course, sure." You know.

328
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:42,448
"Use your key.
I'll be sleeping. But, yeah."

329
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:45,718
So, the next morning,
she forgot her key, of course.

330
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,255
And she's knocking at the door,
and I go to answer the door.

331
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,856
My eyes are, like, glued shut.

332
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,560
And I open the door, and she goes,
"Sarah, this is Amber."

333
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,662
And I said,
"Amber, it's so nice to meet you.

334
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,331
I've heard so much about you."
And I grabbed her hand.

335
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:02,668
And her hand was a hook.

336
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,371
And...

337
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,308
Not important to the story,
just for color,

338
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,943
both of her hands were hooks.

339
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,548
But, um... I was in too deep.

340
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,583
I just... I shook it.

341
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,453
I shook her hook.

342
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,491
And it was such a false moment, too.

343
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,461
I'm sure she would have appreciated
if I was like:

344
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:31,564
"You have a hook for a hand.
I don't know what the etiquette is."

345
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,434
And she'd be like,
"Thank you for being real with me.

346
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:36,802
Nobody's ever real with me.

347
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,704
Yes, you can shake it, whatever."

348
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,508
And then we would be real friends,
and we'd probably have inside jokes,

349
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,344
and that's how it plays out in my mind.
But...

350
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,916
I just shook her hook as if to say:

351
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,619
"This is what a hand feels like to me."

352
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:55,521
Bye.

353
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,789
And went back to sleep.

354
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,892
And pretended it was all a neat dream.

355
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:03,562
But Jesus Christ, rabbi.

356
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,398
She must have told me nine things
about Amber.

357
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,273
Two of them should have been hooks, right?
I'm not being an asshole.

358
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,308
Minimum.

359
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,979
She's got hooks for hands.

360
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,280
She's amazing.

361
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:22,648
She lives in Ethiopia.

362
00:21:22,715 --> 00:21:24,383
She single-handedly ran an...

363
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,918
That would have made more sense.

364
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,721
She's brilliant, she's inspiring.

365
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,757
Double back, just a reminder...

366
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:33,559
she's got hooks for hands.

367
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,764
But not Susie, not the rabbi.

368
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,832
She doesn't see color.

369
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:41,667
She doesn't even see hands.

370
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,702
That's how amazing she is.

371
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,475
I'm a... I'm a...

372
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,645
I'm a very sexual person.

373
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:57,016
Um... You can always tell a sexual person

374
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,920
because they, um, tell you as a segue

375
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:03,889
to their next bit in their stand-up act.

376
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,391
It's kind of a little hint.

377
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,759
I am, though. I...

378
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,629
I know that it's cool
to talk crazy during sex,

379
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,965
and I... I have tried that.

380
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,068
And it doesn't work for me,
because I just...

381
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:20,406
I find that the truth, uh,
gets in the way, I guess.

382
00:22:20,472 --> 00:22:21,473
Like, I...

383
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:26,912
Like, "God, your cock is so...
Oh, no, never... It was a shadow."

384
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,053
What I do, I feel like, is way crazier.

385
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,057
I like to talk crazy right after sex.

386
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,794
When things have calmed down a beat.

387
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,998
Get right in his face, real quiet.

388
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,704
"What do you think would happen
if I went to the hospital

389
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,072
and got a rape exam right now?

390
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,508
Yeah, what do you think?

391
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,084
You think they'd find your semen
all over and inside me?

392
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,150
'Cause I do.

393
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,520
Oh, I really do.

394
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,160
Maybe you should tickle my back
till I fall asleep.

395
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:17,863
Is that a good idea, motherfucker?"

396
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:25,537
My boyfriend's foreign, so, then I get,
like, really nose to nose with him

397
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:28,540
and go, "USA's number one."

398
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:34,097
He'll be like,
"Number one in what?"

399
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:36,482
"You don't worry about it.

400
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,652
It's important to us
that we're number one.

401
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,188
Juvenile diabetes."

402
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:49,995
What is the etiquette...?

403
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:53,032
I don't know if there are, like,
any Emily Post-ish people here.

404
00:23:53,999 --> 00:23:59,471
But for postcoital cuddling, uh,
or after-sex cuddling, if you're stupid,

405
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,440
what is the...?

406
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:06,178
What is the etiquette
for where I would put my...

407
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,480
"his asshole" fingers?

408
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,786
Is it just straight out to the side?

409
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,588
Or... under a pillow?

410
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,591
Or just... Just sever it.

411
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:21,493
Just cut it off completely.

412
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,796
That's...
That's what happened to Amber's hands.

413
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,101
I'm kidding, you guys.

414
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,469
Come on.

415
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:32,905
Relax.

416
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,074
It was land mines when she was 7.

417
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:43,015
Look, sometimes I like to end a joke
with a sad truth.

418
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:47,820
Thank you, Jodyne.

419
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,494
You're killing it, Sarah.

420
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:03,802
We give our daughters Barbie dolls
so that they have an image

421
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:08,273
of what they should look like
when they grow up that is not attainable

422
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,876
so that they can learn
that they're a piece of shit

423
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,544
and they should kill themselves.

424
00:25:13,045 --> 00:25:14,780
It's so important.

425
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,216
We have to teach them young.

426
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,652
I'm not sure, uh...

427
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:25,657
who designs the schematics
of these Barbie dolls, or Bratz dolls,

428
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,960
or any of the sex-worker dolls.

429
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,097
I'm not sure who we're protecting.

430
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:33,232
Uh...

431
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,136
Where the obscenity lies, or...

432
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,871
Okay, so, Barbie.

433
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:42,241
Like, her legs are twice the length
of the rest of her body.

434
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:45,577
And her feet are just:
They're just on tiptoes.

435
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,579
She can only wear high heels.

436
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,015
She couldn't wear flats if she wanted to.

437
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:53,218
When she's taking a shit
at 3 in the morning, she's in heels.

438
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:54,853
'Cause she's a lady.

439
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,792
Her breasts... Okay.

440
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,161
So, uh...

441
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:05,898
she only has, like, the big,
fat, shiny part of the breast

442
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,733
that guys jerk off to.

443
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,770
We have to protect our daughters...

444
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,307
from the life-nourishing nipple.

445
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,042
We... That's just too obscene.

446
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,811
No nipples.

447
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:25,751
We can't have our daughters
seeing what nourishes life.

448
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,253
Just the part
that can sandwich a hard cock.

449
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,027
No pubic hair.

450
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,763
That is attainable.

451
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,097
You're right, audience.

452
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,134
You know what?
Thanks for keeping me honest.

453
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:43,902
That's important. It is attainable.

454
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:46,371
Not everybody can pull that look off,
but yes.

455
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,108
People always want Angelina Jolie's lips.

456
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,946
And I'm not bragging.
I basically have Angelina Jolie's lips.

457
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,714
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

458
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,684
But, um, mine are in my underpants.

459
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,750
But...

460
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,258
That's why I like a nice...

461
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,695
groomed but triangular...

462
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,931
nuanced bush.

463
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:17,002
That doesn't technically make sense,
but it sounded fancy.

464
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:22,641
I did a, um...

465
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:28,680
Art reflects life.

466
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:34,786
Okay?
And then, uh, life informs art, you know?

467
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:35,988
And then, um...

468
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:40,926
But we don't... Movies, I don't feel like
really reflect life totally for women.

469
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,328
It's more of like
a male's projection of it.

470
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,298
It's getting a little better,
but even in artsy-fartsy movies,

471
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,668
like, if you see a woman masturbating
in a scene,

472
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,905
she's always on her back.
All dreamy and sexy.

473
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,942
She's never on her stomach,
dead-eyed and slack-jawed, like it is.

474
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:00,379
It's work.

475
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:09,988
We learn what love is
from movies and television,

476
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,790
and it's ruined love for us.

477
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,460
Romantic comedies, all that shit,
it's ruined love.

478
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,698
We... It's taught us
that we are incomplete people

479
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:24,169
who need to find that one person
in the whole world that will complete us.

480
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:26,438
I promise you,
there are thousands of people

481
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,441
that are perfectly good matches
for any one of you.

482
00:28:30,776 --> 00:28:32,744
And I don't want to be complete...
I don't...

483
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,915
I'm working very hard to be
a complete person every day, you know?

484
00:28:36,982 --> 00:28:38,850
I don't... I don't wanna make you whole.

485
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,052
I want you to come whole.

486
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,821
I want you to be in...
And I know I just said "come hole."

487
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,395
Another thing Barbie does not have.

488
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,936
That would be
a really weird feminist stance.

489
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,305
"Why doesn't Barbie have a come hole?"

490
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:09,214
"I don't know. What is that?
It's subjective."

491
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,018
Noted.

492
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,924
I did a fundraiser here a few years ago

493
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:23,128
with, um, my friend Lizz Winstead's
organization, Lady Parts Justice.

494
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,997
Check it out.

495
00:29:25,063 --> 00:29:29,434
And, uh, it was basically...
I always say it was like a, you know, um,

496
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,003
"right to choose" kind of thing.

497
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,806
But it was, technically,
literally, just for women in Texas.

498
00:29:34,873 --> 00:29:37,342
Because, at the time,
every abortion clinic

499
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:39,945
was being shut down in Texas.
They were down to five.

500
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,081
It's since gotten much worse. But, um...

501
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,917
And we just literally
wanted to raise money

502
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,552
to give to women in Texas

503
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:50,422
so they could, like, hire a babysitter

504
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:53,058
while they drive 12 hours
to get an abortion.

505
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:57,162
Or an affordable mammogram,
or a, you know, pap smear, or whatever.

506
00:29:57,562 --> 00:30:03,001
And, uh, so, we did this show,
and there were protestors outside.

507
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:08,940
Um, you know, "right to life," uh,
Westboro Baptist Church-y, NPR people.

508
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:10,575
And... Not NPR.

509
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:11,843
NRA.

510
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,381
That is... They are different.

511
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:22,087
Completely different tote bags.

512
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,926
Um, and they were outside protesting.

513
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:32,597
And I'm not gonna shit on them,
because I am them.

514
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:33,864
We're the same.

515
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,034
You know,
I'm the product of how I was raised.

516
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:41,473
I was raised by a couple
of liberal bleeding-heart Democrat Jews,

517
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,242
and now I am one.
And I would love to think

518
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,945
that I'd get there on my own,
but probably not.

519
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,914
I'm the product of how I was raised.

520
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,917
And these people were raised
by people who loved them

521
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,954
who said, "There are people out there
that want to murder babies."

522
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,490
If I was that kid, I'd be like,
"We have to stop them."

523
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:01,059
And I'd be outside there protesting.

524
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,464
So, I went outside,
and I just wanted to say hi

525
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:10,502
and show a warm, friendly face
to baby murderer.

526
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:16,375
And I said, uh, "Hey, hi.
Isn't it great...? I just wanna say,

527
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:21,113
isn't it great that we live in a country
where I can put on this show

528
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,181
because it's something that I believe in,

529
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:26,585
and you can protest this show
because of what you believe in,

530
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:30,021
and we can occupy
the same space peacefully?"

531
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,191
And he said, "God, you're totally right."

532
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,494
I'm just kidding.
He goes, "You're going to hell."

533
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,529
And I was like, "Okay, nice to meet you."

534
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:45,170
But there was, like, a 9-year-old girl
there with a little pink cardigan.

535
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:48,473
And she had a huge...
She had a sign, like, twice her size.

536
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:53,078
And it said, uh,
"Abortion is bloody murder."

537
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:58,417
And the "bloody" was, like, in red paint,
dripping down.

538
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:02,320
And that was the first time I was like,
"Oh, they had to go to, like,

539
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:06,525
Michaels or Blick's
or something and buy crafts.

540
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,995
Hobby Lobby, probably."

541
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,501
And she goes:

542
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:14,633
"God hates you."

543
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,271
And I was like,
"Do you really think God hates?"

544
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,506
And she goes, "Yeah, he hates you."

545
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:25,110
And then... Oh, I told her a doodie joke.

546
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:26,177
And she was like:

547
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,984
It really is the great unifier.

548
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:38,423
But she is right.
Abortion does kill, like, your whole day.

549
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,329
It literally sucks the life out of you.

550
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:53,038
Look, I know those last two jokes,
they aren't smart.

551
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:56,007
They have nothing deep to say.
They're just wordplay.

552
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,709
But I love them like my...

553
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,679
very own aborted fetuses.

554
00:33:03,014 --> 00:33:04,014
Um...

555
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,117
Put a pin in that.

556
00:33:06,184 --> 00:33:07,252
Congratulations, Texas.

557
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,555
Texas was almost the third state...

558
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:14,459
uh, but then a judge
put the kibosh on it.

559
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,396
You should know this. I'm not blaming
you for not knowing about this law,

560
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:19,498
because we've been...

561
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:24,069
Just atrocity after atrocity
has been coming at us every day.

562
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,171
But you're not gonna believe this.
It's true.

563
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:29,741
They have a law where
if you get an abortion in those states

564
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,743
or have a miscarriage,

565
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:36,314
you are responsible
for paying for a funeral

566
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:37,649
for the fetal tissue.

567
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:39,784
What?

568
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,051
What?

569
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:43,354
Crazy.

570
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:45,524
And heinous.

571
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,427
And I want to speak
at those funerals so bad.

572
00:33:57,269 --> 00:33:59,170
He died the way he lived.

573
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:07,112
The size of a sesame seed
with no discernable brain function.

574
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,449
He will be returned now to the soil...

575
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:13,618
where he will...

576
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:16,488
I don't know,
get eaten by a cricket, maybe.

577
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:24,195
So, anyway, this fundraiser.

578
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:30,168
This is the thing, is the religious right
knows that it will be a bear of a...

579
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,171
Not the religious right.
I guess the government now...

580
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:37,242
knows that it would be a bear of a job

581
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:42,247
to overturn <i>Roe v. Wade,</i>
to just make abortion illegal all at once.

582
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:47,319
So, what they do is they chip away at it
from the sides, you know.

583
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:52,357
They make little laws, insincere laws,
that kind of are an ends to their means.

584
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:56,728
You know, uh, "All right, uh,
your clinic has to have hallways

585
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:58,296
that are 18 feet wide."

586
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,099
And then the clinics are like, "We can't...

587
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,570
We don't have... I mean, that would cost...
We couldn't afford to... "

588
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:08,506
"Well, I guess you're gonna
have to close, then, aren't you?"

589
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:11,876
You know, it's very, uh, Boss Hogg
from <i>Dukes of Hazzard </i>or something.

590
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,779
You know, like,
smashing your headlights and going:

591
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,726
"Looks like you can't drive.

592
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,451
You got a smashed headlight."
It's exactly that.

593
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:22,554
And violating... Uh...

594
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:27,892
Infantilizing laws about abortion
where women have to think about it.

595
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,128
Go home for three days and think about it.

596
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,897
Yeah, I think I've been thinking about it,
fuckface.

597
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:34,833
Or, like...

598
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:39,571
Violating ultrasounds, you know,
where they shove a camera inside you

599
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:44,476
and make you look at the ultrasound
and see the life in your uterus.

600
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:47,278
And... Put a pin in that for a second.

601
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:50,715
Because I have another fun fact for you
you're gonna love.

602
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,153
This is true. Scientists have known this
for almost two decades.

603
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,588
If you believe in science.

604
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,289
That...

605
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,190
And this is it.

606
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,528
Sperm can smell.

607
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,500
I know... I know sperm can...
We all know sperm can smell.

608
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,669
But...

609
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:14,639
sperm cells... Seashells by the seashore.

610
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,875
Sarah, come on, focus.

611
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,543
This is a big night.

612
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,514
This is serious, though.

613
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,618
Sperm cells have a sense of smell.

614
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:29,754
They have olfactory senses. That's true.

615
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:35,660
And you know what that means.
That means that sperm is life.

616
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:38,863
And you know what that means.

617
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,201
We've gotta legislate that shit.

618
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:49,741
We have to protect the babies.

619
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:52,544
I... I just wanna save the unborn babies.

620
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,480
That's all I'm worried about,
and this is what we're gonna do.

621
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:59,517
The next time you feel like
you're gonna jerk off into a gym sock

622
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,253
or down your shower drain or, uh...

623
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,924
I don't know why,
I peg you as an "on the belly" guy.

624
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,259
It doesn't matter, though.

625
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,329
It doesn't matter.
Whatever your jerk-off style,

626
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:12,564
there is no judgment here.

627
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,333
I was right, wasn't I?

628
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,935
I have a sense.

629
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:22,674
If only that was a superpower
that could help the world.

630
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,741
But...

631
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:27,846
This is what we're gonna do.
Before you do jerk off,

632
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,447
whatever style it is...

633
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,383
Um... I feel like keeping going. Like...

634
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:36,721
you are like a hands-free
fucking the mattress.

635
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,523
Like, you're just flat...

636
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,528
Blink once if... I knew it!

637
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,029
You guys are humoring me.

638
00:37:45,296 --> 00:37:46,397
You guys are nice.

639
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,665
All right. Come on, Sarah.

640
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,637
Before you do it,
you're gonna come on down to the clinic.

641
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,774
We're gonna take a long, thin...

642
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,544
Like a knitting-needle-shaped
GoPro camera, basically.

643
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:04,582
It's gonna go up your urethra,
your penis hole.

644
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:06,384
Up, up, up. Really picture it.

645
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,921
And then down,
down into your testicular sac.

646
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,624
We're gonna bring the ultrasound around,

647
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,360
and you're gonna be able to actually see

648
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,363
the life in your balls.

649
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:23,434
I truly believe...

650
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:28,006
that most men
will not even want to jerk off after that.

651
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,607
And that's a beautiful thing.

652
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,982
Show business is so weird.

653
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,852
I don't know why this is when
it really struck me.

654
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:44,789
But I did an episode... A few years ago,
I did that show, <i>The Good Wife.</i>

655
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,692
Okay? And it's, like, a law drama.

656
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:48,960
And it was really fun.

657
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:52,630
And maybe it's 'cause I was, like, sitting
and watching a lot of them shoot.

658
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:56,367
You would never believe
how show business works. It's so crazy.

659
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,669
Like, okay.

660
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,705
Let's see if I can explain this.
Like... It's...

661
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:05,643
So, this scene is a big boardroom scene,
right, 'cause it's a law drama.

662
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,912
And it's got a bunch of characters in it.

663
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,748
And they're all talking,
and all this shit happens in it.

664
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:16,087
So, the first shot they do, they do a big,
wide shot of the whole scene

665
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,089
with all the characters and everything.

666
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,593
They do that a few times.
Then they go in close

667
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:24,729
and they shoot, like, a tight shot
where it's just, like...

668
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,065
You only see, like,
three of the characters.

669
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:31,035
And when they exit that scene,
like, in our minds we see the whole room

670
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:32,570
because we've seen it before.

671
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:36,407
But in reality, when they're shooting it,
the rest of the room isn't even there.

672
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,842
It's, like, filled up with, like,

673
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,912
reflecting boards and cameras and lights

674
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:44,048
and, you know,
all this other shit, you know.

675
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,483
I don't know all the words.

676
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,954
Cameramen and, uh, all that shit.

677
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:53,958
So, it's like, uh,
Christine Baranski will go:

678
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,661
"I want those papers
on my desk Monday morning."

679
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:03,635
And she's literally
in her skirt suit and heels.

680
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:10,541
Christine Baranski in a ball
because she can't leave entirely,

681
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,977
'cause there's so much shit
blocking the way.

682
00:40:13,044 --> 00:40:14,879
But she has to get as low as possible

683
00:40:14,946 --> 00:40:18,549
so she doesn't block the lights
for the rest of the scene,

684
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,586
for the actors that are still
in the scene. So, she's like this.

685
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,021
And then Josh Charles is like:

686
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,690
"She's a piece of work.
I'll see you Monday."

687
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:30,995
Everything you watch is that.

688
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:36,901
I just burped.

689
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,169
I'm a human being.

690
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,147
I was, uh...
Three weeks ago, I was at a red light.

691
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:53,117
No, put a pin in that for a second.
Okay.

692
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:57,789
I took an acting class
when I was 10 in New Hampshire.

693
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,558
This goes together.

694
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:05,063
And, first of all,
this acting teacher was mean.

695
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,931
I remember he said, like, um...

696
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,600
Oh, one assignment was,
bring in your favorite song

697
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,536
and, like, act out to it.

698
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,706
And then I brought in my favorite song,
which is, like, um...

699
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,744
♪ <i>Just a city boy</i>
<i>Born and raised</i>... ♪

700
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,112
"Don't Stop Believin'."

701
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,213
Sorry.

702
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,751
And, like,
I thought that acting was mouthing it.

703
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27,818
So, I was like:

704
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:32,223
And he went bananas on me.

705
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,861
And you know, I wish at 10
I had the wherewithal to be like:

706
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,198
"You know what?
He's probably going through something.

707
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:42,967
That's his."

708
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,170
No.
I didn't know to do that when I was 10.

709
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:48,039
I just assumed I was a piece of shit.

710
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:50,508
But that's not the story I wanted to tell.

711
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,077
So, the first day of acting class,
he said this:

712
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,178
"Acting...

713
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:59,851
is reacting."

714
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,786
And I'm like, "What does that mean?"

715
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,554
Like, "re"?

716
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,990
I knew "re" meant again.

717
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,892
So, I was like, "Acting again?"

718
00:42:07,959 --> 00:42:08,959
Anyway...

719
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:11,629
Three weeks ago, I was at a red light.

720
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:12,696
And I was like:

721
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:14,966
"Oh, reacting.

722
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,569
Right.

723
00:42:18,636 --> 00:42:19,636
Oh, yeah.

724
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,074
I agree with that, yes.
Acting is reacting.

725
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,810
You should have said it that way."

726
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:29,747
Latent...

727
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,583
realizations.

728
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:36,220
That's the theme of this chunk
when I do my special.

729
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:40,591
Latent... Latent realizations. Like...

730
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,694
Okay, I had to go to sleepaway camp...

731
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,598
every year since I was 6 years old.

732
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:52,336
And, uh, it was terrible for me

733
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:55,640
because I was a chronic bed wetter
till I was, like, 15.

734
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,842
So, it was a nightmare.

735
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,612
I learned a lot of skills,
like complete disassociation.

736
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:08,319
Making a cot over soaking-wet sheets
while I stink like piss

737
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,289
and pretending like that's not the case.

738
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:17,195
What kind of parents would send
a chronic bed wetter to sleepaway camp?

739
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,030
They must be monsters. No.

740
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:21,065
They're not monsters.

741
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:22,900
Here's the thing. Okay.

742
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,002
Like, my dad...

743
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:29,807
his dad beat the shit out of him
every day.

744
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:36,214
And then during the school year
he was sent away to goyim.

745
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,316
To boarding school. I'm sorry.

746
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,785
To boarding school.

747
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:42,987
And then at boarding school...

748
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:46,224
he got the shit kicked out of him
every day,

749
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,992
called a dirty Jew kike,

750
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,694
because it was back when, like...

751
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,029
America was great.

752
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,030
And...

753
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,881
And then in the... All right.

754
00:44:00,905 --> 00:44:03,274
That was pretty good.

755
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,777
And then in the summertime,

756
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,215
he went to camp and blossomed

757
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:15,119
and was a star and was, like,
everything he wanted to be.

758
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:18,356
And so, parents, they just think...

759
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,092
You know, he just thought,
"No, camp is great.

760
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,261
It will define her. It will be her joy.

761
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,429
Because that's what it was for me."
You know?

762
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:27,865
So, I had to go to camp.

763
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:31,335
And as a compromise,
he would give me joke books.

764
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,171
Because I loved jokes.

765
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,007
And then, also,
maybe I'd make friends that way.

766
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,176
So, I remember the summer I was 8

767
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,913
because I had just learned to read
when I was 7.

768
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,850
Someone in the audience when I was
in Vermont was like, "I was 4."

769
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,418
Fucking good for you. I was 7.

770
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,921
I learned to read when I was 7.

771
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:52,256
So, I was 8, I was excited.

772
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:54,225
I had books. I was gonna read.

773
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,694
And my dad has no boundaries.

774
00:44:56,761 --> 00:44:59,997
I don't know if he flipped
through these at all or didn't.

775
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,801
Um, but it was <i>Truly Tasteless Jokes</i>
book one and two.

776
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:09,373
And I remember the first joke
on the first page.

777
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,176
It was a paragraph long,
but I can tell it in two seconds.

778
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:15,279
It was "Little Red Riding Hood,
blah, blah, blah.

779
00:45:15,346 --> 00:45:18,049
And then the big bad wolf is like,
'I'm gonna eat you.'

780
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,718
And then Little Red Riding Hood's like,
'Eat, eat, eat.

781
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:22,386
Doesn't anybody fuck anymore?'"

782
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,488
And I'm like, "What does this mean?"

783
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:34,432
Then when I was 30
I was like, "Oh, Jesus Christ.

784
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:36,133
That's so inappropriate."

785
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:41,839
He was, uh... My dad isn't...
He has no boundaries.

786
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,774
He's not approp... I don't really...

787
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:46,077
He... He treated us like bros.

788
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,981
Like, um, I remember one time
when I was really young,

789
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,816
he and my mom went on a double date.

790
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:55,486
And when he came home,
he, like, plopped down on the front hall...

791
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,855
There was, like,
a bench in the front hall.

792
00:45:57,922 --> 00:46:00,524
And I was sitting there,
and I asked him how it went.

793
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,860
And he was like,
"Oh, it was the fucking worst.

794
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:05,162
Uh, we were supposed to go out
with the Sterlings,

795
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:07,164
and then only Mr. Sterling showed up.

796
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:09,333
Because he said Mrs. Sterling
had her period.

797
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,003
And when she gets her period,
it comes out like liver.

798
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:14,038
And I'm like,
'I don't need to know that.'"

799
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,445
I was like, "Dad, I get it.

800
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:24,415
Like, I'm 5,
and I don't even need to know that."

801
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:28,319
But my dad, um...

802
00:46:29,253 --> 00:46:30,521
Camp was where he thrived.

803
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:33,190
And, like, they're still his best friends
to this day.

804
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,292
His best friends
are his friends from camp.

805
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,997
And he's about to be 80,
and they're having a reunion, even.

806
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:44,535
And he has a picture of all of them,
uh, when they became counselors.

807
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,405
And it's amazing. It's from 1953.

808
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,907
And I said,
"Dad, you have to send me this."

809
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,210
And he sent it to me with, like,
a glossary of who everybody is

810
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,446
and what they're doing now. And it's like:

811
00:46:55,513 --> 00:46:58,516
"This is Phil Holman. He's a judge now.

812
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:00,217
This is Arnie Goldstein.

813
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,820
You know, he owns Martin's House of Cloth.

814
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,321
This is Danny Gold.

815
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:09,427
Danny Gold once gave Punchy Kramer a BJ
and we all watched.

816
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:12,096
This is Cy Schwartz.

817
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:14,165
He works at the Clam King.

818
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,300
This is bah, bah, bah. He da, da, da.

819
00:47:16,367 --> 00:47:18,069
This is Morris Simon.

820
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:20,104
This is Punchy Kramer.

821
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,406
This is, you know, blah, blah, blah."

822
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:25,409
I'm like,
"Dad, open with it or close with it."

823
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,278
He has no sense.

824
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,617
So, he went to camp all the way up
until he became a counselor.

825
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:37,321
And, uh, you know, we think of counselors,
like, as grown-ups.

826
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,224
But, you know, they're 16-year-old kids.

827
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:44,161
So, for each camper,
he had to fill out a form,

828
00:47:44,562 --> 00:47:46,430
uh, every week for each camper.

829
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:49,166
And it would say, like, "Is he behaving?

830
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:51,268
Is he sleeping? Did he brush his teeth?

831
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,970
Did he go to the bathroom?"

832
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:56,340
And under that it said, "L/H."

833
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,976
And my dad didn't know what that meant.

834
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,445
But he was too embarrassed to ask anybody.

835
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:04,515
So, he just used his logic,
and he's like, "Okay.

836
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:09,220
It comes after bathroom,
so it must mean...

837
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:11,956
'loose or hard.'"

838
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:19,330
So, for a summer...

839
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:28,139
my dad had his campers come get him...

840
00:48:29,607 --> 00:48:31,475
after they took shits...

841
00:48:33,944 --> 00:48:36,113
so that he could go look at them...

842
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,219
and make a rough guesstimate...

843
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,090
if it was indeed loose or hard.

844
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,393
I love that so much.

845
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:54,031
It just means there's, like, a generation
of old men in therapy...

846
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:56,132
who are like:

847
00:48:57,234 --> 00:49:01,238
"Well, I did have a camp counselor
that was, like, obsessed with my shits.

848
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,305
Is that...?"

849
00:49:04,475 --> 00:49:05,943
You were sexually abused.

850
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:12,216
Oh, it meant "letter home."

851
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,687
But thank God he didn't ask.

852
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,556
That would have been so embarrassing.

853
00:49:22,493 --> 00:49:25,129
My parents got divorced when I was 7.

854
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:28,632
And my mom went back to college
to get her degree.

855
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:30,534
And my sisters were older.

856
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:32,736
So, I got babysat by nuns.

857
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:36,140
I went to, like, a nun...
A convent, I guess.

858
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:37,408
But it looked like a...

859
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:41,145
Like a Victorian house or something,
where nuns were.

860
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:42,980
And they had day care.

861
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:45,649
And I have since met amazing nuns.

862
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:47,685
These were not them. These were cunts.

863
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,387
They... They were.

864
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:51,689
They hit us.

865
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:55,092
It was...
I had not been hit before, you know.

866
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,228
And I was so scared of them.

867
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:01,031
Like, if we weren't sleeping
on our, like, little mats during nap time,

868
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:02,600
they would hit us.

869
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,002
And then, like, um, for lunch

870
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:07,705
we would go out into the woods,
'cause it's New Hampshire,

871
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,408
and they gave us
these peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches,

872
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:14,478
and we had to eat the whole thing,
or they would hit us.

873
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,482
And I loved peanut butter and jelly.

874
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,585
But this was different.

875
00:50:21,652 --> 00:50:23,254
It was peanut butter and jam.

876
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,721
And jam is...

877
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,625
I hadn't experienced jam before.

878
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:30,127
It's like... It's different.

879
00:50:30,794 --> 00:50:33,631
It has, like, pieces in it.

880
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,136
But we had to eat the whole thing,
or they would hit us.

881
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,604
I was so scared, I...

882
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:43,741
'Cause I didn't know I could take a punch
at that time.

883
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,510
And I... Okay, wait.

884
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,811
Put a pin in that.

885
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,148
Put a pin in that
while I tell you something.

886
00:50:52,116 --> 00:50:56,620
This is human behavior,
that we tell ourselves horror...

887
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,522
Horror stories.

888
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,557
Horror stories.

889
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:01,759
Horror stories.

890
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,193
Horror stories.

891
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,395
Horror.

892
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,498
Horror stories. We tell ourselves...

893
00:51:08,365 --> 00:51:10,100
I said it too many times.

894
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:14,505
We tell ourselves horror stories.

895
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,174
That's just the human condition.

896
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,512
You know, like we go, uh,
"I have to pass that crack in the road

897
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,415
before that car passes me, or I'll die."

898
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:27,451
That wasn't just you. That's everybody.

899
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:29,186
Everybody does that.

900
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:32,623
My therapist says
it's how we deal with mortality.

901
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:38,729
Um, so, I was eating
this peanut-butter-and-jam sandwich,

902
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:42,633
and I was telling myself horror stories.

903
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,235
And the horror story was...

904
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:49,206
this jam is the nuns' period blood.

905
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:58,749
But I had to eat it all.
I was so scared of getting hit.

906
00:51:58,816 --> 00:51:59,850
I ate it like this.

907
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,888
And I gobbled it down.
I don't know what...

908
00:52:06,724 --> 00:52:08,392
put in my head that...

909
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:15,165
jam would, you know, have, like,
chunky liver-like pieces in it.

910
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:22,439
Okay, I'm gonna try
to tell you this story.

911
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,675
I almost died this summer.

912
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:26,543
I really almost died this summer.

913
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,345
I, um... I was on the road.

914
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:30,414
Had a shitty sore throat.

915
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,849
Didn't think much about it.

916
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:34,785
Kind of turned into a cold,
that kind of thing.

917
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,921
Uh, then I came home,
and I got that same sore throat again.

918
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,791
So, I go, "Ehh, I'm home.
I'll go to the doctor."

919
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:42,292
Which I never do.

920
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:43,594
So, I went to the doctor.

921
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:47,164
And, uh, he made me wait,
like, a long time.

922
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,800
And I was going to go, like,
"Oh, fuck this." But I stayed.

923
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,669
He looks down my throat, and he's like:

924
00:52:52,736 --> 00:52:54,538
"We're going to the emergency room."

925
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:58,842
I had a...
Like an abscess at the top of my...

926
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:03,480
windpipe, which is where
your breathing comes from.

927
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:08,452
So, um, like, this abscess was either
gonna grow another millimeter

928
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,189
and stop my breathing and I would die,

929
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,924
or it was gonna explode,

930
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,860
and it's filled with poison,
and that would kill me.

931
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,429
Um...

932
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:21,565
Don't be scared. It's really rare.
It's not going to happen to you.

933
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,901
Unless it does, I guess.

934
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:24,967
But...

935
00:53:25,836 --> 00:53:27,805
So, I had to go to the hospital.

936
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:33,510
And then, um, they put me under,
like, a general...

937
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,879
Like a... Some sort of drug

938
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,949
just to chill me out before surgery.

939
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,518
And, like, unbeknownst to me,

940
00:53:41,585 --> 00:53:45,522
they're telling my, uh, friend Amy
and my boyfriend, Michael,

941
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:48,258
they're like, um,
"This is a very dangerous surgery.

942
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,461
She might not make it.

943
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,796
You know, it's very risky."
Blah, blah, blah.

944
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:55,566
Meanwhile, I feel fine.

945
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,002
And I'm just like, "I'm not high enough."

946
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,271
I was complaining
that I wasn't high enough.

947
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:06,543
And I can tell you exactly what happened
because Amy had the utter distaste

948
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,712
to record this whole thing.

949
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,413
So...

950
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:14,518
You just see me going like,
"I'm not high enough."

951
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:16,353
And then they're like, "You're okay."

952
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:19,623
And then I proved to them
that I wasn't high enough,

953
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,693
um, by explaining Brexit.

954
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:27,664
And it was very nuanced,
and I had opinions.

955
00:54:27,731 --> 00:54:29,466
It was, like, really perfect.

956
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:31,835
Like, you can hear
the anesthesiologist go, like:

957
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:33,637
"Wow, she's right on."

958
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:35,438
And, um...

959
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,610
And then, uh, you see me,
like, getting wheeled out.

960
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:43,680
And then, um, like, Michael and Amy
couldn't come with me,

961
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,483
like, past the operating-room doors
or whatever.

962
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:50,921
So, as I'm leaving, I said to Michael...
Which is something we like to do,

963
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:53,423
if the elevator doors are closing
or something:

964
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,858
"I wanna see other people."

965
00:54:54,925 --> 00:54:55,925
And then...

966
00:54:58,629 --> 00:55:02,933
And then the last thing you see
on the video is me looking into her phone

967
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,069
and going like, "Play this in slow motion
on my death reel."

968
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:07,336
So, um...

969
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:12,509
So, then I had this surgery.

970
00:55:12,576 --> 00:55:14,711
And I lived. And, um...

971
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:18,448
But it was really... It was a rough week

972
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:22,653
because I have very low blood pressure,
I guess.

973
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,622
And so,
they couldn't put me to sleep for it.

974
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:28,325
And so, I had to have...

975
00:55:28,392 --> 00:55:32,062
Once the surgery was done,
they put a breathing tube down my throat.

976
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,533
And then because it's human nature
if you're awake

977
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,703
to pull something
that's in your throat out,

978
00:55:40,103 --> 00:55:42,773
they had to tie my hands down.

979
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,842
So, every time I would wake up,

980
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,779
I would go to pull this thing
out of my throat.

981
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,682
And then I would see that my hands
were tied down,

982
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,651
and then I just thought
what anyone would think

983
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:57,888
in that situation, which is,
"I've been captured by ISIS."

984
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:00,524
And it was so scary.

985
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:03,393
And then a sister would have to come
to my side and be like,

986
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,495
"Sweetie, you're okay.
You just had surgery.

987
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:08,765
They have to have your hand... "
You know, and then I would understand.

988
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:11,868
And then I would fall asleep,
and a minute later I would wake up

989
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,837
and the whole thing would happen again.

990
00:56:13,904 --> 00:56:15,105
And it was really scary.

991
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,507
It was a nightmare. I don't remember...

992
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:21,878
Like, I was awake,
but I don't remember anything.

993
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,414
And there were a few funny stories.

994
00:56:24,481 --> 00:56:25,481
Like, um...

995
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,719
I would be really itchy.

996
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,921
The medicine that was in me was so itchy.

997
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:32,656
But my hands were tied down.

998
00:56:32,723 --> 00:56:34,691
And my sisters would fight
with the nurses

999
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:37,594
to just let one hand free
so I could scratch.

1000
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,962
So, they finally did.

1001
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,164
And, uh, it was...

1002
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:44,835
like, I had an itch, like,
just vagina-adjacent.

1003
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:48,105
And I... It felt...
It was, like, so much relief.

1004
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:51,508
And then my friend John
was standing in the corner.

1005
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,910
And I guess... I don't remember this.
I was told this.

1006
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,445
I pulled my hand out

1007
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,648
and then I, like, served it to John.

1008
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:02,119
And then, another time, like,
my hands were tied down.

1009
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,719
And, um...

1010
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:06,523
That I served it?

1011
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,693
And then, um... He was like:

1012
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:13,096
In my mind. I don't remember.

1013
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,134
Oh, another time...

1014
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:20,938
I was told, a nurse was in the room,

1015
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,975
and I, somehow, like,
even though I had no mouth or hands,

1016
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,945
but I, like, made it clear to her, like,
it was an emergency.

1017
00:57:28,011 --> 00:57:31,648
I had to tell her something.
And they had given me paper and a pencil.

1018
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:35,485
And I'm writing,
and it's, like, so important.

1019
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,754
And I finally finish,
and then I show it to her,

1020
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:41,458
and she looks, and it just says,
"Do you live with your mother?"

1021
00:57:41,525 --> 00:57:42,859
With a picture of a dick.

1022
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:46,095
And, I mean...

1023
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,668
it's really proof that once
your conscious mind is out of the way,

1024
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:53,971
it's just, like, sheer comic genius.

1025
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:59,209
You guys, we've reached the denouement.

1026
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:05,816
Were you making a noise because
you're impressed that I knew that word?

1027
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,483
Thank you.

1028
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,855
You've been very vocal,
but in the perfect amount.

1029
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:14,857
You're welcome.

1030
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:23,834
Like, the next time you wanna, like,
be like, "Yay," for me or something,

1031
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,669
let's do this. You can go like this:

1032
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,640
Okay, the denouement.

1033
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,742
Did I say it right?

1034
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,014
Now we're gonna have to, like, pick up
a shot of you going:

1035
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:43,720
Um, yeah, because we're here.

1036
00:58:45,088 --> 00:58:47,124
Um... Jesus is coming back.

1037
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,793
Oh, on my back.

1038
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,795
That's what it is.

1039
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,166
It was water. He turned it to come.

1040
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:59,169
How clever is that?

1041
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,776
I don't know if there's God.

1042
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:08,211
I mean, I cannot imagine there's God.

1043
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:10,247
But I don't know.

1044
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,648
Neither do you, you know?

1045
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:14,851
But if there is God,
it's a God that's, like,

1046
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:17,287
totally fine with murder

1047
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:22,659
and, uh, children starving
and... spin class.

1048
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:25,796
You know, all the...
All the atrocities of life.

1049
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:27,831
I take...

1050
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,166
Spin class is great,

1051
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:33,036
if you love being punched in the vagina
70 times a minute.

1052
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:37,107
While just an ocean...

1053
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:38,642
Thank you, Steve Agee.

1054
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:45,682
While just an ocean of white people
are singing the N-word with such glee.

1055
00:59:49,286 --> 00:59:51,988
It's because they play hip-hop music
in there.

1056
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:53,290
Did I need to say that?

1057
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,925
Oh, my gosh.

1058
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:59,963
Were you guys like,
"Is that what they do in there?

1059
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,868
Can I burn calories doing that?"

1060
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:05,935
Yes.

1061
01:00:09,139 --> 01:00:10,139
I feel...

1062
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,376
I feel like a fraud
because I feel like I talk so much

1063
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,712
about God and Jesus and all this stuff,

1064
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,648
and... I'm embarrassed to admit this,
but I'm going to admit it.

1065
01:00:18,715 --> 01:00:20,684
I have not read the Bible.

1066
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,653
I've tried. I have tried.

1067
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:26,323
In my defense, it's unreadable.

1068
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:29,659
It's so boring.

1069
01:00:30,327 --> 01:00:31,628
It's so dense.

1070
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,131
But it's, like,
not as deep as it thinks it is.

1071
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:39,302
And it just reads like a super-shitty
<i>Game of Thrones</i> spec script or something.

1072
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,942
When is that coming back, <i>Game of Thrones?</i>

1073
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,277
- Not until...
- June.

1074
01:00:47,344 --> 01:00:48,979
- April?
- June.

1075
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:50,046
- June.
- June?

1076
01:00:50,113 --> 01:00:51,648
It just was June.

1077
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,683
Oh, my God.

1078
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,784
I love it so much.

1079
01:00:54,851 --> 01:00:55,919
It's not perfect.

1080
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,188
It isn't perfect, though.

1081
01:00:58,255 --> 01:01:02,659
It's like they... 'Cause, look,
everybody wears 900 pounds of armor.

1082
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:05,896
Then nothing from here to here.

1083
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,331
They just have this area to breathe.

1084
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,170
You know what the number one cause
of death is in Game of Throne-y times?

1085
01:01:13,236 --> 01:01:14,871
Neck stabs.

1086
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:17,307
Head-chopped-offs.

1087
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:20,243
Throat slits.

1088
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:25,448
I'm just saying, there's a blacksmith in
the fictional past that should be fired.

1089
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,822
The app that I do Twitter with,
I can, um...

1090
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,859
I just sounded so old saying that.

1091
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:38,295
The app that I do Twitter with,

1092
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:42,232
it's like I can schedule tweets.

1093
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:45,368
Which I like, because sometimes
I'll think of two, three tweets.

1094
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:46,937
I don't wanna spoil you.

1095
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,405
I space them out.

1096
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,909
Many years ago now,
the beginning of Twitter, practically,

1097
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,212
I scheduled a tweet.

1098
01:01:56,913 --> 01:02:01,184
I scheduled it for 8:05 p.m. Pacific Time.

1099
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,485
Why would I remember that?

1100
01:02:03,787 --> 01:02:06,389
Because at 8 p.m. Pacific Time...

1101
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:10,093
we captured and killed Osama bin Laden.

1102
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:13,897
The Twitterverse was aflame.

1103
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,434
At 8:05...

1104
01:02:19,936 --> 01:02:21,371
I tweeted:

1105
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:26,176
"Why do my dog's doodies come out cold?"

1106
01:02:34,251 --> 01:02:37,454
Let me just remind you,
I scheduled that tweet.

1107
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,256
That's how good I thought it was.

1108
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,394
And I feel a little bit like Peter Sellers
in <i>Being There.</i>

1109
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:49,065
Like, people put more depth on me
than I have at all.

1110
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:52,102
I bet there were people
that saw that tweet and were like:

1111
01:02:52,168 --> 01:02:55,171
"You know what? That was cold.
But it is our duty."

1112
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,349
Okay, this is how I'm gonna end.

1113
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:11,888
I'm guessing this is
a pretty godless crowd.

1114
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:16,326
Um, I like to... I've been on the road,
and I like to end by asking if there's a...

1115
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:18,528
Now I feel like a bully
because it's so godless.

1116
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,097
Usually when I'm in the rest
of the country,

1117
01:03:21,164 --> 01:03:22,899
I'm the only godless one,

1118
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,801
and then I don't feel like an asshole.

1119
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:28,872
But are there any guys here
that believe in God?

1120
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,375
Not like, "I believe there's something."
I mean, like, an organized religion.

1121
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:36,012
Like Christian, Muslim, Jewish,
bah, bah, bah...

1122
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,949
You've got, like, five seconds
to raise your hand, if you're close.

1123
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:41,985
Yeah, I didn't think so.

1124
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:43,052
Really?

1125
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:46,890
Can you come up closer to me
so that I'm in the light?

1126
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:49,192
But just come up to the stage.

1127
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:50,960
What's your religion?

1128
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,396
Uh... I would say I'm Christian.

1129
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,934
You would say you're Christian?

1130
01:03:58,001 --> 01:04:00,470
There's, like,
a lot of different words we could use.

1131
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:01,538
I'm Protestant.

1132
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:04,074
I would probably classify myself
as Lutheran.

1133
01:04:05,075 --> 01:04:06,009
All right.

1134
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:07,076
Okay.

1135
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:09,612
What is your name, sir?

1136
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:11,381
- Troy.
- Hi, Troy.

1137
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:13,116
- Hi.
- Thank you for doing this.

1138
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,351
This is very brave.

1139
01:04:15,018 --> 01:04:16,886
We're in Los Angeles. It's very godless.

1140
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,955
I draw the godless out.

1141
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:21,991
So, I don't want you to feel bullied
or something.

1142
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:24,894
It's okay.
I raised my hand voluntarily.

1143
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:26,529
What did you say your name was? Troy?

1144
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:28,932
- Troy.
- Oh, okay. That's fun.

1145
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:29,998
All right, Troy.

1146
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,202
I'm dying to ask this question.

1147
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:34,537
I'm so excited there's a God person here.

1148
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,940
All right, you're a Christian.

1149
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,326
- Right.
- Protestant area.

1150
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,544
This is a question...

1151
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:46,983
that I think should be
one of the big questions, even.

1152
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,151
Okay.

1153
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,218
Yes or no...

1154
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:53,390
would you let God come in your mouth?

1155
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,898
- No, no.
- No?

1156
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,442
- No.
- Okay, go back to your seat.

1157
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,001
Oh, my God, no.

1158
01:05:05,068 --> 01:05:06,102
Thank you very much.

1159
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,169
Thank you, Troy.

1160
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,506
No. That's mind-blowing to me.

1161
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,508
And yet not unique.

1162
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:14,511
Not a unique answer, I'll tell you that.

1163
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,047
I would say the answer has to be yes.

1164
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:22,218
Um, but I will tell you
that as I've been touring the country,

1165
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:26,055
80 percent, at least,
of men say no, like Troy.

1166
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:29,292
So, congratulations on not being unique.

1167
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:32,695
And yet being wrong, in my opinion.

1168
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,965
That is, uh, so petty, I think.

1169
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,936
You know, it's like, up until now,
Troy, you're saying, "God...

1170
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,973
I know that there's AIDS and rape

1171
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,543
and famine and genocide and murder.

1172
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,213
But I know you have a plan,
and I am your servant.

1173
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,514
Unless you're serving come.

1174
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,581
Then I'm out."

1175
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,087
That's so petty.

1176
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:05,495
God told Abraham to kill his son.

1177
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,131
And you know what Abraham said?

1178
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:10,099
"No problem. Chip!

1179
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,968
Get down here!"

1180
01:06:15,238 --> 01:06:19,108
I know, I didn't read the Bible, but
everybody knows Abraham's son was Chip.

1181
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:24,714
And Abraham was gonna murder his son.

1182
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,084
And then right before he did,
God was like, "I'm kidding.

1183
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:29,752
Can I come in your mouth?"

1184
01:06:36,726 --> 01:06:40,497
Abraham's like,
"Is that a test of my faith?"

1185
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:44,334
God's like, "Sure. Yes."

1186
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:51,341
And then God came in Abraham...

1187
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:55,645
This is turning into fan fiction.
But God came in Abraham's mouth.

1188
01:06:58,114 --> 01:06:59,148
And Abraham's like:

1189
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:05,154
"Wow, I really thought that
you were gonna stop at the last second

1190
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,791
like you did with the killing my... "
Or I guess he'd be like,

1191
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:11,761
"Like you did with the killing my son."

1192
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,269
God's like, "I work in mysterious ways."

1193
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:21,771
Thank you guys so much.

1194
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,422
- Okay.
- I'm sharp as a tack.

1195
01:07:40,323 --> 01:07:42,668
- There you go.
- But they did just put something

1196
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:46,229
in intravenously.
And it... And it feels like maybe...

1197
01:07:47,163 --> 01:07:48,197
I'm getting high.

1198
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,101
Am I getting high?

1199
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:56,339
It feels like...

1200
01:07:57,807 --> 01:07:59,576
It's not that big a deal, actually.

1201
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,377
It's not very intense.

1202
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,547
I feel like I could give a...

1203
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:07,116
I could argue a political side.

1204
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:11,588
Mm-hm. So, tell me...
Talk me through Brexit.

1205
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:16,259
Brexit is like, you know,
the same people that, uh...

1206
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:21,130
name their kids... Bentley

1207
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,333
'cause they think that's classy.

1208
01:08:23,399 --> 01:08:25,835
They are the people voting for Brexit.

1209
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:31,341
Completely unknowing, innocent.

1210
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:34,277
Uh...
Thinking it's in their best interest.

1211
01:08:34,344 --> 01:08:36,746
They're voting
completely against their best interest.

1212
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:43,319
These things that the EU provide
their lives to make them livable.

1213
01:08:44,354 --> 01:08:46,189
Uh, they've just ousted that.

1214
01:08:46,556 --> 01:08:50,660
And they're counting on the NHS,
and that was a big sham promise.

1215
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:52,361
Mm-hm.

1216
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:54,430
Uh...

1217
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:56,531
You know.

1218
01:08:57,266 --> 01:09:00,370
So, what are you gonna do?
There are a lot of Bentleys in the world.

1219
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,406
A lot of Mercedes and Porsches.

1220
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:06,509
And they're gonna be strippers.

1221
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:09,746
But some of them might be
Supreme Court justices.

1222
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:10,880
Mm-hm.

1223
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,282
And I have hope.

1224
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:15,218
And I believe in people.

1225
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:17,320
We're all just listening to the same...

1226
01:09:17,787 --> 01:09:19,689
To different sets of lies.

1227
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:22,484
Maybe you should...

1228
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:25,638
- And she's still making sense, too.
- Maybe you should give her more.

1229
01:09:25,662 --> 01:09:27,230
I am. I don't feel very high.

1230
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,765
No, that's right.

1231
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,767
No, no. That's good. You're perfect.

1232
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:34,504
You know...
just if people were spoken to...

1233
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,372
This is what she's like
every day.

1234
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,174
by people
who don't have agendas

1235
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:40,309
and can just honestly
make an earnest decision

1236
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:43,913
based on what they think is best
for themselves and the country,

1237
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,683
we would have wild success all around.

1238
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:48,284
I know, right?

1239
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:53,356
But we don't have that,
unfortunately.

1240
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:56,325
I'm not high yet at all.

1241
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,927
This stuff is shit.

1242
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:03,965
Well...

1243
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:07,203
They're gonna roll me into the ER

1244
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:10,206
and put me to sleep for a few days
with a breathing tube.

1245
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:14,911
Some kind of new diet.

1246
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:17,413
Is that what you were expecting
when you woke up?

1247
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,080
That wasn't what
I was expecting.

1248
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:23,920
- Okay.
- Bye. I love you both so much.

1249
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,826
- I love you.
- See you soon.

1250
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:27,523
See you on the flip side.

1251
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:29,292
Michael,
I wanna see other people.

1252
01:10:31,761 --> 01:10:32,962
Damn you.

1253
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,336
Okay, we love you.

1254
01:10:40,403 --> 01:10:41,771
Love you. Bye-bye.

1255
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:46,008
Play that last bit
in slow motion on my death reel.
