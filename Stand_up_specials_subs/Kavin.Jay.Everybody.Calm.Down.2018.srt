1
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,280
<i>welcome to</i> Kavin Jay: Everybody Calm Down!

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,720
<i>Now, please put your hands together</i>

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,320
<i>for the guy whose name is in the title,</i>

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,440
<i>Kavin Jay!</i>

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,120
Singapore, how are you guys doing?

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,120
Oh, yeah, it's a lot...
It took a lot of balls.

8
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,280
It took a lot of balls for a Malaysian guy
to shoot his special

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,840
in Singapore.

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,840
Oh, this is gonna be...
You guys look beautiful. All right, uh...

11
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,360
Singaporeans, make some noise!

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
Malaysians, make some noise!

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,720
I would like to thank
the production company,

14
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,840
because, uh, they put me up
in a very nice hotel. All right.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,080
It's so posh,
that the towels are so fluffy,

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,120
I couldn't close my suitcase.

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,480
I had to take out the shampoo
and conditioner.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,840
All right, before I start,
ladies and gentlemen,

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
please, please give yourselves
a round of applause.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,840
I love that phrase, right,
"Give yourselves a round of applause."

21
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,840
It's such a beautiful phrase, right?

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,640
A lot of emcees use it,
a lot of, uh, you know, comedians use it.

23
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,800
But it's one of those things
where I find it to be very Asian.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Right? Because y'all did all the work.

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,560
You all bought the tickets.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,720
You all braved the jam.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
You all came here,
you all found your seats.

28
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,360
And now, you all are great audience.

29
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,560
And now, give yourself the reward.

30
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,680
That's like my wife coming home
and saying, "Oh, you did the dishes.

31
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,360
Give yourself a blowjob."

32
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,480
Which I've tried, it's very difficult.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,240
Which is also why I picked up yoga. Uh...

34
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,760
You'll never see Downward Facing Dog
the same way again.

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Uh...

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Aw, ladies and gentlemen, look,

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,240
I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring it out
right in the front, right, I'm gonna...

38
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm gonna tell you all something
that maybe you all may not have noticed.

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Uh, I am a bit overweight.

40
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,840
You laughed a bit too hard there,
my friend.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,960
I know, I know I'm big. I know I'm big.

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,800
Like, you see, the thing is, I travel
around the world doing comedy now,

43
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,240
and it's weird, though,
because I went to Europe,

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,080
and I found out I'm not that big.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,520
I went to America,
I found out I am a medium.

46
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,120
And I had to shop in Baby Gap.

47
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,200
Right, but it's one of those things,
in Asia, I'm the Michelin Man.

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,680
I am so fat that parents use me
to discipline their children.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
Hey, I was walking down the street,
a mother looked at me,

50
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,480
looked at her child and said,
"If you don't behave,

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,320
that man will eat you!"

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,320
And that's what I do,
I eat children. Uh...

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,480
They are delicious and gluten-free.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,920
I'm only joking. They are not gluten-free.

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,280
Uh...

56
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,200
Uh, but Malaysians, Malaysians, they have
this honesty about them, right?

57
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,360
They don't care whether you're fat,
ugly or whatever.

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,840
They tell you straight to your face.

59
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
Right? Like...

60
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,480
I don't know if you know this,

61
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,440
but for a few years,
I did radio in Malaysia, right?

62
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,360
As I was doing radio in Malaysia,

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,480
a lot of people didn't realize
that I was the stand-up comedian Kavin Jay

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
and the radio personality Kavin Jay.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
They thought it was two different person.

66
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,520
One lady in a show made that connection.

67
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,920
Like, for her, like, "Wow!"

68
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,640
Right? After the show, she came up to me,

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,760
she's like, "Oh, you're
the Kavin Jay on radio, is it?"

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm like, "Yeah, I also do radio."

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,560
And she's like,
"Wow, you sound skinny on radio."

72
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,520
Fuck your mother!

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
What do you want me to do?

74
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
Why... How do you sound fat on radio?

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,520
What, like constantly having
a heart attack the whole time?

76
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,280
I love chicken rice, salad, and burger.

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
But let me tell you,
let me tell you a story

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,560
about how I came
to this realization that maybe,

79
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,200
maybe I should lead a healthier lifestyle.

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,640
Right? This is what happened.

81
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,400
This is a true story that happened to me
a couple of months ago.

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,840
Now, I had a show in Manila, right?

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,520
And I had to fly to Manila,

84
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,760
and I had to book
the tickets myself, right?

85
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,640
So, as a Malaysian,
I always fly AirAsia, right?

86
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,880
Because it's cheap, right?

87
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,600
But, this time, I decided,
you know what, let's make a difference.

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,240
Let's try to make better choices, right?

89
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,400
Let's, let's do something different.

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,320
Right, I decided to fly Cebu Pacific...

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,440
because it was cheaper.

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,520
I booked the tickets online.

93
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,800
I was happy, I was going to Manila,
you know, it's gonna be a good trip. Right, I walked up to the counter
to check in, right.

94
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,040
And then the lady behind the counter
looked at me,

95
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,240
and she said something
I was not expecting.

96
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,000
I was expecting "Hello.

97
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,160
How are you?"

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,480
Maybe even a <i>"Mabuhay,"</i> right?

99
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,920
The lady behind the counter looked at me
and she said, "Sir,

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
how much do you weigh?"

101
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Straight to my face.

102
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,520
There were tears coming down of my eyes.

103
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,920
Thank you for laughing
at my impending diabetes.

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,040
Well, I didn't know what to do.

105
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,160
The only thing that came out
of my mouth at that time was the truth.

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
Right, the truth came out.

107
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,840
Right, I looked at her, and I said, uh,

108
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,840
"I weigh 120 kilograms."

109
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,720
I see a lot of faces of disbelief.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,480
I understand.
I completely understand this,

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,160
because I know I'm deceptively slim.

112
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,880
Okay? Because every time I try to buy
a T-shirt in Malaysia,

113
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,080
they look at me,
the shop owner looks at me,

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,920
and then goes, "For you, L. L.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,480
This one is a big size for you.
Come on, don't worry, L."

116
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,200
And then I walk out with a sports bra.

117
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,120
I have a few sports bras now.

118
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,320
Which is very nice.

119
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,240
But also, like, it's very difficult.
I like wearing clothes, guys.

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,920
I really like wearing clothes.

121
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,640
But it's so hard for me
to buy clothes in Asia.

122
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,040
Like, I... Look.

123
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,800
When I was coming here, I like to wear
funny T-shirts, as you can see.

124
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,040
I like to wear funny T-shirts.

125
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,920
I wanted to buy a T-shirt
that I could wear for this special. Right.

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,640
I was in Singapore yesterday,

127
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,240
I saw a T-shirt that said,
"Fat people are hard to kidnap."

128
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,040
I laughed, too, right?

129
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,800
I wanted that T-shirt.
Right, I wanted to buy the T-shirt.

130
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,720
I walked up to the shop owner, I said,
"Do you have this in double XL?"

131
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
"Uh...

132
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,960
Don't have."

133
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,360
I said, "What's the biggest size
you have?"

134
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,000
"S."

135
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,000
What a dickhead. Uh...

136
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,040
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is,
if you're a size S,

137
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,840
and you're wearing a T-shirt that says,
"Fat people are hard to kidnap,"

138
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,080
I will stab you, all right?

139
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
Back to our story, back to our story.

140
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,960
I'm 120 kilograms, right.

141
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,720
And then, this lady, she looked at me, and she said something
even more unexpected, right.

142
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,600
She looked at me and she said,
"Sir, if you weigh above a certain amount,

143
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,200
you must buy two seats...

144
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,120
on the plane." Right.

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,919
Lowest point of my life.

146
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
I didn't know what to do,
I didn't wanna argue.

147
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,040
I didn't wanna argue.

148
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,280
Right, you know what, I bought two seats.

149
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,560
I just bought two seats.

150
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,120
Right, because I thought to myself,

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,080
"Two meals."

152
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,640
I took the tickets and I very solemnly,
very solemnly...

153
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,480
very sadly walked to the plane...

154
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,560
to find my seats.

155
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
And that's when I found out

156
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,840
that the seats were not together!

157
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,400
What the fuck, guys!

158
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,160
One was at the front of the plane
and one was at the back of the plane!

159
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,600
What are you trying to do,
balancing, is it?

160
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,800
Unbelievable!

161
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,720
I realized now, I realized now
I've come to a point

162
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,760
I'm so fat that when I drop things
on the floor, I let it go.

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,160
Right?

164
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,040
The other day, I was walking around,
five ringgit fell down,

165
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,760
"Fuck it, I'll make more money.
It's fine."

166
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,240
Right. Dropped my car keys,
"Fuck it, I'll take Uber!"

167
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
Like Malaysia and Singapore,
okay, I have to explain

168
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
the history a bit, right, for some people.

169
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,120
Like, do we have anyone here from outside
of Malaysia and Singapore?

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,040
Make some noise!

171
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,160
Hey, where are you guys from?

172
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
Australia.
-Australia. All right, so,

173
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,840
the thing is, you have to understand
Malaysia and Singapore,

174
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,520
we have a relationship, right?

175
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,240
And we have some animosity.

176
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,040
It's like Australia
and New Zealand, I guess. Yeah?

177
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,040
It's like India and Pakistan, right?

178
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,880
It's like America
and the rest of the world.

179
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,520
Right, there is some animosity.

180
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,480
And here is the thing,

181
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,480
I think the best example would be
India and Pakistan, right?

182
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,480
Because they were... They were one family.

183
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,920
And then, they split up.

184
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,640
Right? Like, India and Pakistan,
they were cousins.

185
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,680
Right, they lived, they grew up together.

186
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,280
And then, one day, Pakistan left.

187
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,880
And came back with an AK-47.

188
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,760
"Calm down, Pakistan. What are you doing?"

189
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,320
Like, you know, like Malaysia
and Singapore, it's the same thing.

190
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,080
We were cousins, we were family,
we grew up together, right?

191
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,840
And then, Singapore left.

192
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,320
And came back with a BMW.

193
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,600
Right. It's one of those things
where Malaysians, we...

194
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,160
Okay, let me tell you one thing,
we're a little bit jealous.

195
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay, we also want a BMW.

196
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay, but what we got...

197
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Proton.

198
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,280
Right, so...

199
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,400
Never mind, never mind.
It's okay, we like our Proton.

200
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,400
We love our Proton.

201
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,160
Right? But here's the thing, though.

202
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,680
I mean, I'm sure you guys are lovely,

203
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,480
I'm sure you Singaporeans
are lovely, right?

204
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,360
But there are Singaporeans,
who, you know, I don't like.

205
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,960
And those are the people who think

206
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,840
that Singapore is better
than Malaysia, right?

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,840
Is there anyone who thinks like that here?
Make some noise!

208
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,680
Gosh!

209
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
I still got people clapping like...

210
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,160
Uh... No, but the thing is,
some people do think

211
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,760
that Singapore is better than Malaysia.

212
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,520
I always hear this from my..
From these guys. Right, "Oh,

213
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,320
Singaporean <i>nasi lemak</i> is better
than Malaysian <i>nasi lemak</i>."

214
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,880
No!

215
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,320
No! Of course not. Right?

216
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,160
I tried your <i>nasi lemak</i>.
I tried your <i>nasi lemak</i>, guys.

217
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,520
I went to Punggol

218
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,400
to try your Punggol <i>nasi lemak</i>, famous.

219
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,400
Right.

220
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,440
When I ordered my <i>nasi lemak</i>,
they gave me so little sambal.

221
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
Right. On the menu,
it said "a hint of sambal."

222
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,200
What I saw was a rumor of sambal.

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,680
Where the fuck is my sambal?

224
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,760
Right? And I did
what any Malaysian would do,

225
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
I asked for more sambal.

226
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,960
I went up to the counter,
I asked for more sambal.

227
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,800
You know what they said?
I had to pay extra for sambal.

228
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,600
Pay extra for sambal?
What kind of Communist country is this?

229
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,280
Fifty cents extra,
that's like Malaysian ringgit,

230
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,320
3,000 or something, right?

231
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,640
Around about, around about, you know.

232
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,800
It's not accurate,
but, you know, you get the point.

233
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
Right? And then another one. Oh, oh...

234
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,680
Singaporean <i>bak kut teh</i> is
better than Malaysian <i>bak kut teh</i>.

235
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,640
Is that true?

236
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
No. Even the Muslims are answering
at this point.

237
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,440
Hey.

238
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,480
Even the Muslims are like, "We don't know
what <i>bak kut teh</i> tastes like,

239
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,800
but we believe!"

240
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,760
Right? Because, look, your <i>bak kut teh</i>
is white in color.

241
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,000
It's white in color.

242
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,880
It's so white,
it's trying to get a local wife.

243
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,200
That is how white it is. Right.

244
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,720
Oh, another one. Oh.

245
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,960
Singaporean government is better than...

246
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,800
Malaysian...

247
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,200
Listen, guys, we can't win
every argument, all right?

248
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,920
But at least we got <i>nasi lemak</i>! Yeah!

249
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,840
We hold on to what we got.

250
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,200
Right.

251
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,400
Well, here's the thing, I come down
to Singapore to do a lot of shows.

252
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,800
And a lot of my Malaysian friends
would come around and say,

253
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,200
did you know that they do
the usual Singapore stereotype?

254
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,120
"Hey, Singaporeans have no sense of humor,
why do you comedy do there?

255
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,640
Singaporeans have no sense of humor."

256
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,800
And I find this to be wrong.

257
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,120
Singaporeans, you all have
a sense of humor.

258
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,640
Right? You all have a sense of humor.

259
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,080
It's just a little misplaced.

260
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,920
Like, for instance,

261
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,080
right, in Singapore, right,
you all thought it was a good idea

262
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,200
to have a restaurant called Hooters...

263
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,240
in Singapore.

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,160
Really?

265
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,400
I mean, for those of you
who are pretending

266
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,040
not to know what Hooters is,

267
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,480
because you are sitting next
to your girlfriends or wives.

268
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,440
Hooters is a place where they wear
skimpy outfits

269
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,400
to show off their assets, right?

270
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,200
So that they get tips
at the end of the night, right?

271
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,880
To show off their assets in Singapore.

272
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,000
What is the fucking point?

273
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,520
Because when I went there,
I had the biggest breasts.

274
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,440
Not only did I win
the Wet T-Shirt Contest,

275
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,040
I got second and third.

276
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,720
It's free drinks all night, man.

277
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,200
And another thing, another thing
I realized about Singapore

278
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,600
is that you have,
you guys have trouble letting go. Three years ago,
this was three years ago, guys.

279
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,600
Three years ago,
you all had a riot in Singapore.

280
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,320
Little India riots. Right?

281
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,920
Still fresh in everybody's mind.
Everybody's like, "Yeah, correct." Right?

282
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,120
I opened the newspaper,
"Singapore is ready for new riots." Hello?

283
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,680
Hello.

284
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,360
Twenty-seven Indians overturned a car.

285
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
You all call that a riot?

286
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,640
How cute!

287
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,880
In Malaysia, we call that Tuesday.

288
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,120
And as I found out, in India,
they call that a wedding.

289
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,880
Oh, it's... I make fun of you, guys,
but I love coming to Singapore.

290
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,280
I love coming to Singapore, right.

291
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,440
Uh, the last time I came here, though,
it was a little bit of a weird experience,

292
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,120
because I lost my passport, right.
I lost my passport in Singapore.

293
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,520
And if you ever lost your passport
in a foreign country,

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,960
you will know what this feels like.

295
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,520
If you haven't, try not to do it, right,
because it's a hassle.

296
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,280
You have to make a police report. Right.

297
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,960
And I walked into
a Singapore police station.

298
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,160
I saw things...

299
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,320
that I've never seen before in my life.

300
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,000
All right.

301
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,200
I walked in, and your policemen...

302
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,600
were doing work.

303
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,520
What kind of sorcery is this?

304
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,960
How do you all pick your police?
Can you tell us?

305
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,640
Right. I walked up
to one of the policemen. He looked at me and he said,
"How can I help you?"

306
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
The fucker spoke English!

307
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
I gathered myself, I gathered myself,

308
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,840
I looked at him, I said,
"I lost my passport." Right.

309
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,440
The guy looked at me and said,
"Sir, where are you from?"

310
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
I said, "I'm from Malaysia."

311
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,000
He said, "Sir, can you prove it?"

312
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
So I gave him 50 ringgit and left.

313
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,960
You know, I'm glad you guys laughed, okay,

314
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,560
but he put me in jail!

315
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,880
Do we have any Americans in the audience?
Make some noise!

316
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,360
Uh, well, which part of America
are you from?

317
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,240
New York!
-New York! Yeah!

318
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,840
I don't know where that is.

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
And now you know how that feels, right?

320
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to make fun of you,

321
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,240
but, uh, I did a show in the U.S.

322
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,800
It's a very small place.

323
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,480
Uh, I don't know if you have heard of it.

324
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,320
It's called the American Embassy
in Jakarta.

325
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,720
It's a beautiful place. It is beautiful.

326
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Right, but here's the thing.
Right, here's the thing.

327
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,400
The American immigration officers
that were there,

328
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,800
uh, they were...

329
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,440
a bit strict. Let's put it this way.

330
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,000
Uh, they looked at my passport, right.

331
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,880
My name in my passport
is Kavin Anak Lelaki Jayaram,

332
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,280
which is a typical Malaysian name.

333
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,720
Anak Lelaki is "son of,"
and it's abbreviated to A/L.

334
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,200
So, what they read was, "Kavin Al Jayaram?

335
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,080
I have not heard of that organization.

336
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Bob, get the lube!

337
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,880
Code Brown."

338
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,520
Right, here's...

339
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm not saying...

340
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,200
I'm not saying... I know,
I'm a brown man with a beard.

341
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,000
I understand the stereotype.

342
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,880
Right, I have a mirror at home,
I know what I look like.

343
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,280
All right, but here's the thing,

344
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,120
I grew my beard,
because I wanted to look a bit hipster.

345
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,720
I may have misjudged the length of beard,

346
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
allowed for the color of my skin.

347
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,800
Right? So, basically, everybody
just thinks I'm a terrorist, right?

348
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,880
And flying in airports
is so difficult, right?

349
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,040
Because of "Kavin Al Jayaram." It's...

350
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,440
It's hard, but all I'm saying is,
look, I know what I look like.

351
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,320
But use a bit of common sense.

352
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,960
Okay, use a bit of common sense.

353
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,720
Because have you ever seen
a fat terrorist?

354
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
Right? Think about this.
Nobody is going, "Death to America.

355
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,400
But first,

356
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,920
McDonalds.

357
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,720
Supersize." No, no.

358
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,680
Nobody is doing that, right?

359
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
But I'm from Malaysia.
I'm from Malaysia, right?

360
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,440
And I know, for a fact, that in Malaysia,
we will never have terrorists.

361
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,560
We will never have terrorists in Malaysia.

362
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,840
Right
Think about this.

363
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,960
If you're a terrorist
in the middle of Kuala Lumpur,

364
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,680
carrying a backpack full of explosives,

365
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,480
we have snatch thieves.

366
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,160
You're not gonna get very far.

367
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,560
Right? I mean...

368
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,800
It's like, "Death to America!

369
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,280
No 72 virgins for me, huh?"

370
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,840
Uh...

371
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,760
Seventy-two virgins,
that's the best thing about terrorism.

372
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,920
Wait, hold on, that came out wrong. Uh...

373
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,760
It's funny though, like, look,

374
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,600
they believe
that if they martyred themselves,

375
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,560
if they kill themselves
in the name of terrorism,

376
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,360
they get 72 virgins in the afterlife.

377
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,360
Seventy-two virgins, right.

378
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,160
Which is a great marketing plan.

379
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
If you're a guy.

380
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,880
Right, what if you're a female terrorist?

381
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,160
Right, what then?

382
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,160
Seventy

383
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,840
That's not a reward, you know.

384
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,840
That's a punishment, right?

385
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,040
Seventy-two men who don't know
what the hell they're doing.

386
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,560
Seventy-two premature ejaculations.

387
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,320
Seventy-two Singaporean men.

388
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,280
Everybody, calm down!

389
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,360
It's just jokes, all right?

390
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,600
You know, look, I'm not gonna lie
to you, we do have an accent.

391
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,360
Malaysia, Singapore, it's very similar.

392
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,200
It's very similar. We have Manglish,
you have Singlish, right?

393
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,320
It's very similar, though.

394
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,160
I mean, in a way that we put the "lah"
at the end of every sentence

395
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,760
just to fuck things up, right?

396
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,720
And then, there's also...

397
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,240
There's also the fact that...

398
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,960
Malaysia and Singapore,
I mean, in Malaysia,

399
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,760
there's a lot of people, who,

400
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,440
you know, English is a second language.

401
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,600
Like Singapore as well, some of you all,
English is a second language, right?

402
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,920
So it's very difficult for us to grasp
some grammatical things.

403
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,640
Like, for instance, pluralization, right?

404
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,360
It's very difficult to understand

405
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
when do you pluralize something
and when you don't.

406
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,840
So, what we do,
is we just pluralize everything.

407
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,720
Right? That's a good way to start,
I guess.

408
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,760
Like, you know, like,
when you call a receptionist,

409
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,320
"Hows may I helps you?"

410
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,920
Right? That happens.

411
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,680
And like, I was talking
to a friend of mine,

412
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,000
like, I was talking
about his favorite anime, right.

413
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,760
He looked at me and said, "<i>Dragons Balls.</i>"

414
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm like, "No, that's <i>hentai.</i>
What are you doing?

415
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,400
It's different. Don't."

416
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,680
You know, it's weird, though, but, uh...

417
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:57,560
sometimes, just one word of a sentence,
can screw things up tremendously.

418
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,440
Right? Like, for instance,
a few years ago,

419
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,520
we had the Typhoon Haiyan
that hit the Philippines, right?

420
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,720
Now, I'm not making fun of it.
I'm not making fun of it.

421
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,600
Right, it's a tragedy,
people lost their homes,

422
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,000
people lost their lives.

423
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,520
Right? And as the ASEAN community,

424
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,760
Singapore, Malaysia,
we wanted to help out.

425
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
Right? I wanted to help out.

426
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,040
Giving donations of food
and, you know, water and stuff like that.

427
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,320
Right, so I walked up to this counter,

428
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,600
collecting donations in Malaysia.

429
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,640
And the lady behind the counter
looked at me and said, "Sir...

430
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,920
do you want to send 'aids'...

431
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,200
to Philippines?"

432
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,520
I'm like, "What are we sending
to Philippines?"

433
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,800
"'Aids. Aids' to the Philippines."

434
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,120
I'm like, "Hold on, wait, hold on
a minute, okay? Calm down. Wait, what...

435
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,920
How are we sending 'AIDS'
to the Philippines?"

436
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,560
She's like, "Don't worry, sir,
you just give me the 'aids.'

437
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,680
I will personally send it for you."

438
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,240
Which I thought
was a good delivery system.

439
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,320
Until I found out
the Americans beat us to it. Uh...

440
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,760
Everybody, calm down!

441
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,720
It's just jokes, all right?

442
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,480
Uh, but accents work both ways, though.
Accents work both ways.

443
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,200
Like, when I was 17 years old,
uh, I went to England to study.

444
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,680
Right, I lived there for five years.

445
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,880
Now, do we have anyone from England?
Make some noise!

446
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,480
Good. Fuck them, right.
Because, you see...

447
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,240
You see, because I was going to...
I was going to England, right.

448
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,560
And I thought I was going to England
where they spoke English.

449
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,960
I thought I was prepared.

450
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,840
Right, I did really well in the exams.

451
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,640
I thought I was prepared.

452
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,240
Right. My mother was an English teacher.

453
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,480
I thought I was prepared, right.

454
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,720
I even had friends
who were English people,

455
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,600
from England, uh, in Malaysia.

456
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,760
And he taught me some phrases.

457
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,120
Like, I learned from him,
that if I say "I'm tired,"

458
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
they would say, "I'm knackered."

459
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,280
Right? Difference.

460
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,600
Right? Like, if, for instance, I say,
"That's a transvestite."

461
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,720
He would say, "That's my girlfriend."

462
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,800
Subtle differences, right?

463
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,920
I thought I was prepared,
I knew everything.

464
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,720
Now, I was going to, you know...

465
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,080
And then, I took a flight from Malaysia,

466
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,000
and I landed in Newcastle Airport.

467
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,440
Now, if you don't know what Newcastle is,
Newcastle is like the Kelantan...

468
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,000
of England.

469
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,040
Where they spoke in a different accent,
nobody understood them.

470
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,360
Right, I remember I walked out,

471
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,280
17 years old, I walked out from the plane,

472
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
and people were looking at me like,
<i>"Why aye, man?"</i>

473
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,240
I'm like, "<i>Sí, señor.</i>"

474
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,680
"Did I take the wrong flight?
What is going on?

475
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,080
Have the Vikings not left?

476
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,560
Where am I?"

477
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,480
Right? I got over the accent,
I got over the accent quite quick.

478
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,000
Right, but there was one thing
I didn't get over.

479
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,440
Which is the way
the British people told time.

480
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,760
Which was very different
from the rest of the world.

481
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,000
Because I'm used to the usual way
that we have learned in school.

482
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,360
Which was, if you asked someone the time,

483
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,440
they would look at you
and go, "It's 8:30, 4:15."

484
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,920
Hour, minute, no bullshit.

485
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,600
So easy, right?

486
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,800
But as a 17-year-old boy,

487
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,080
I remember asking someone the time,

488
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,200
he looks at me, he says...

489
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,440
"Quarter past four."

490
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,280
And I looked at him, I said,

491
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,400
"Dickhead.

492
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,040
Why are you making me do maths?

493
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,880
I asked for the time, not a riddle,
what are you doing?

494
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,560
Why am I solving
a quadratic equation right now?

495
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,160
Why do I need a scientific calculator
to tell the time?

496
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
Why"

497
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,360
Right? And then, I realized that sometimes
they don't even tell you the hour.

498
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,520
They would just look at you and go,
"It is half past."

499
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,360
Half past what?

500
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,520
That's like going to McDonalds

501
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,080
and ordering a Big Mac,
and they give you a bun.

502
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,960
You figure out the rest.

503
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,440
Hey, come on.

504
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,840
Like, just tell me the time,
what's wrong with you

505
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,040
Now, when British people
ask me the time...

506
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,960
Right. Because it took me three years,
it took me three years, for...

507
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,120
I was there for five years.

508
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,400
For the first three years,
I didn't know what time it was.

509
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
The whole time,
I just kept looking at the sun.

510
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,040
"Where the fuck is the sun?"

511
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,280
How fucked up does a place have to be,

512
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,360
that the sun refuses to show up?

513
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,480
It took me three years.

514
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,800
I read books, I did research.

515
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,600
Right, at the end of three years,
I became a maths genius.

516
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,280
Right, I became a maths genius.

517
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
Now, when British people ask me the time,

518
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,600
I fuck with them.

519
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,960
Now, when British people
ask me the time, I go,

520
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,520
"It is five past...

521
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,440
quarter to...

522
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
half past six."

523
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
And when they look at me all confused,

524
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,080
I go, "Divided by eight!"

525
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,760
Uh, ladies and gentlemen...

526
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,840
uh, as I said, you know,
traveling the world doing stand-up comedy,

527
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,120
I realized one thing.
I don't know if you've noticed this.

528
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,160
Uh, I am Malaysian,
but I'm Indian by descent.

529
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,720
Right, my parents are Indian
from Malaysia.

530
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,080
And my grandparents
were from India, right.

531
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,960
And, uh, you see, the thing is,
Indians have moved around the world.

532
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:52,960
Right? Everywhere, everywhere
in every country, there are Indians.

533
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,400
Like, I've been to Switzerland,
there are Indian people there.

534
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,200
Like, I've been to Fiji,
there are Indian people there, right. And the thing is, everywhere in the world,
this is the stereotype of Indian people.

535
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,920
"Tiki, tiki, tiki, I work at 7-Eleven.

536
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,200
Tiki, tiki, tiki, I fix your computer.
Tiki, tiki."

537
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,120
Fuck you guys for laughing at that.

538
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,280
But in Malaysia,
it's a little bit different.

539
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
It's a little bit different.

540
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,800
Right, this is the stereotype
of Indian people.

541
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,560
"Tiki, tiki, tiki, I stab you.

542
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,120
Tiki, tiki, tiki, I steal your computer."

543
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,400
Right? You know, but the thing is,

544
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,800
that is the stereotype
of Indian people in Malaysia, right.

545
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,800
And I grew up in Malaysia
as an Indian, right.

546
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,480
And it's hard, though.

547
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,960
Because my dad... My dad has a very thick
Indian accent, right.

548
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,600
My dad... I didn't quite understand him
when I was younger because when...

549
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,960
He used to give me advice, right.

550
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,320
When I was younger, he would come up
to me and say, "Son,

551
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,240
if you're looking for the right woman,

552
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,120
you must look for the three B's.

553
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,920
The brains,

554
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,680
the beauty...

555
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,760
and the 'bersonality'."

556
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,400
I have not found the "bersonality" yet,
ladies and gentlemen.

557
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,200
But here's the thing, me and my dad
have a relationship, right.

558
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,240
Like every other Asian dad and son. Right.

559
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,520
Like, for instance, you, sir.

560
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,160
Like you and your dad.

561
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,000
Do you have a good relationship
with your dad?

562
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,360
Yes.
-Yeah. Fair enough.

563
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,600
Did your dad ever tell you, "I love you,"

564
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,320
in your whole life?

565
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,920
-Maybe once or twice.
 Maybe once or twice.

566
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,320
Well done.

567
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
Because my father has never been
that drunk, I guess.

568
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,360
I...

569
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,400
I don't know, my dad has never told me
he loves me.

570
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,040
Right, he has never told me he loves me.

571
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,120
Like, it's weird, because now,
I have a child of my own,

572
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,960
right, a beautiful six-year-old girl.

573
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,120
Right. And I love her, I love her,
I tell her I love her every day.

574
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,560
And I realized that my father tells her...

575
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,600
he loves her, too.

576
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,720
What about me?

577
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,800
With her, he can say it,
but with me, he cannot.

578
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,160
And I asked him, I looked at him
and I said, "Dad, why...

579
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,120
How come you've never said
'I love you' to me?"

580
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,360
And he looked at me and said,
"Why must I tell you?

581
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,760
You're alive, aren't you?"

582
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,480
Right? Like, my dad,
my dad loves alcohol. He drinks...

583
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
a lot.

584
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,440
Borderline alcohol problem, right. But...

585
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,040
But he drinks a lot, and the thing is,
I owe everything to my dad.

586
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,040
I owe a lot of things to my dad, right.

587
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,080
Because I wouldn't be a comedian
if it wasn't for my dad.

588
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,480
Right, because my dad would tell me jokes
when I was younger.

589
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,720
Right. Maybe they were
a little bit inappropriate,

590
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,200
but he would tell me jokes when he drinks.

591
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,840
Like, I remember this one joke he told me.
Let me see if you like it, right?

592
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,320
Uh, when I was younger, he came up to me
and he said, "Son,

593
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,320
why do Chinese people like to watch
porno movies backwards?

594
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,960
Because they like to see the prostitute
give the money back."

595
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,639
Listen, listen, I'm glad
you guys liked it, all right.

596
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,440
But I was five years old, all right?

597
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,320
And I remember, like, my dad...
I looked at my dad, like,

598
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,960
"Dad, what's a prostitute?"

599
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,280
And my dad was like, "Your auntie!
Your auntie is a prostitute!"

600
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,440
My mother recently added me
on Facebook. Right.

601
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,000
Uh, it's hard to get up in the morning

602
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,800
to find out you have been poked
by your mother.

603
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,480
I remember the first time
my mother poked me,

604
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,800
my father liked it.

605
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,760
It was very bad.

606
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,280
Like, okay, my mom is...
She has a smartphone now.

607
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
She has a smartphone.

608
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,679
Right, like, how many of you all
are in a family WhatsApp group?

609
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,880
Make some noise.

610
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,720
How many of you all wanna kill yourselves?
Make some noise!

611
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,240
Right! It's one of those...
The worst thing ever!

612
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
The family WhatsApp
where you can't leave the group.

613
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,680
It's like leaving the fucking family.

614
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,720
Like what is the point
of the family WhatsApp group?

615
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,520
Ten thousand messages in the morning.
"Good morning, family."

616
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,680
Really

617
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,240
You have never said good morning
to me to my face!

618
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,000
But now, suddenly, so many messages,
all with pictures...

619
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,440
of angels. "Good morning, family."

620
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,440
What are you doing

621
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,280
And my mom, she likes
to forward messages, wholesale.

622
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,440
Wholesale forward messages
from one group to another.

623
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,480
Doesn't read through the messages.

624
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,960
She just forwards the messages
from one group to another.

625
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,480
Like, the other day, I got a message,

626
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,960
"Oh, chicken causes cancer."

627
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,560
Three minutes later, "Rice causes cancer."

628
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,200
Five minutes later, "Come home,
chicken curry and rice for dinner."

629
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,920
Commitment, Mother.

630
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,120
I realized, I didn't have
a very good relationship

631
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,760
with my parents when I was growing up.

632
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,760
And I guess I understand why.

633
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,360
Because I wasn't a very good kid
when I was growing up.

634
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,760
Right, for instance, for instance,

635
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,000
this is something I used to do,
I used to shoplift a lot.

636
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,200
I used to shoplift, right.

637
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,240
I guess it's a way
to get attention. Right?

638
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
It's a way to get attention.
It's also a way for... You know, I didn't get a lot of money
when I was a kid,

639
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,080
so I thought, there's things that I wanted
and I just took it right from the shops.

640
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,480
Like, for instance,
here's one thing, uh...

641
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,480
As an example, I used to steal condoms

642
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,880
from the shop.

643
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,120
But, okay, look, I still do it now.

644
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,880
I still steal condoms,
not because of attention.

645
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,160
Now, I just do it, because I can't deal

646
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,560
with the judgment
of the person behind the counter

647
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,800
when you buy a condom, right?

648
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,480
It's very difficult. It's very difficult.

649
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,480
Like, when I buy condoms,
I put it in the counter,

650
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,320
they look at me,
look at the condoms and go...

651
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,960
"Oh...

652
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,840
You're having sex, huh?

653
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,720
Twelve pack, huh?

654
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,320
Strawberry flavor, huh?"

655
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,480
Right, it's very difficult
to deal with that.

656
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,440
Right? So what I do, I just steal it,
I just stole it, right.

657
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,840
And then...

658
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,480
Well, it came to a time
when I was 17 years old

659
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,200
that I wanted to use one of the condoms.

660
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,640
Basically, what I'm saying is,

661
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,320
I lost my virginity
when I was 17 years old.

662
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,080
Calm down.

663
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,200
Don't be so happy I lost my virginity.

664
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
I lost my virginity
when I was 17 years old.

665
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,440
And I found it again
when I got married, though.

666
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,120
Uh...

667
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,040
It was in the drawer all along, right.

668
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,760
There came a time when I had to use it,
and I realized,

669
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,280
at that time, in the '90s,
I had made a mistake.

670
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,640
Right, I had made a mistake.

671
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,280
Instead of stealing condoms,
I had stolen Femidoms.

672
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,880
Female condoms. Right.

673
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,080
And, look,
if you don't know the difference,

674
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,840
it's the same thing,

675
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,440
only the size of a dinner plate.

676
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,560
I remember looking at it, going, "Shit.

677
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,080
Is that the normal size?

678
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
Am I Chinese"

679
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,240
Right.

680
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,320
When I was young, I used to watch
a lot of porn movies.

681
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,960
I used to watch a lot of porn movies.

682
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,320
Okay, to be fair, I still watch it now.

683
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,640
Because I am married.

684
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,960
Do you remember the first porn movie
you ever watched, bro? No. You don't watch porn, of course.

685
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,880
No. No, of course.

686
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,520
I don't know. I don't even know
why I looked at you, right.

687
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,760
Because you look like the kind of guy

688
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,560
I wanna go to your house
and download your hard drive.

689
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,120
Yeah, you look like the kind of guy
I would download your hard drive,

690
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,600
lock myself in a room
for three months, come out just blind.

691
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
All dissolved.

692
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,600
But, okay, the reason I asked you

693
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,440
is because I remember
the first one I watched.

694
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,560
It was called
<i>Sorority Girls and the Creature from Hell.</i>

695
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,440
Right.

696
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,440
It's absolutely true. Google this.

697
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,400
Google this. It's absolutely true.

698
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,720
It does exist, right.

699
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,960
I remember my friend...

700
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,160
uh, got this videotape from...
Brought this videotape to school.

701
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,680
Remember VHS tapes?
Do you guys remember VHS tapes?

702
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,840
Yeah, it was on VHS tape, right.

703
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,400
He brought it to school,
told everybody that it was wrestling.

704
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,040
But I knew what it was.

705
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,000
I knew what it was, right.

706
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:53,080
VHS tapes, the cutting-edge technology
of our time.

707
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,520
Right, the cutting-edge technology
of our time.

708
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,360
Because before that,
all we had was the TV, right?

709
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,280
And you always, like, MediaCorp,
or TV1, TV2, that's all you had, right?

710
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,960
If you wanted to, you could not...

711
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,880
If you wanted to go to the toilet,
you either had to wait for an ad break,

712
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,160
or you had to miss two to five minutes
of the movie. Right?

713
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,360
Then, came VHS tapes.

714
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,560
You can rewind, you can forward.

715
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,480
You can pause.

716
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,960
The...

717
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,960
The pause button.

718
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,320
It was not a pause button,
it was a dance button, wasn't it?

719
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,880
Right, you can be watching
the most violent movie in the world,

720
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,800
like <i>Rambo.</i>

721
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,720
Pause.

722
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,880
Unpause.

723
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,800
Right?

724
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,680
You can make any movie
into a Bollywood movie,

725
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,720
that's what I'm saying.

726
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,480
How many of you all
were growing up in the '80s?

727
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,480
Make some noise!

728
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,520
How many of you all grew up in the '90s?
Make some noise!

729
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,120
You all can fuck off, right. Because...

730
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,640
No, here's the thing. Here's the thing.
Look at the guys who grew up in the '80s.

731
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,080
They're the most innovative,
the most creative,

732
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,720
the most hardworking people in the world.

733
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,920
You know why?

734
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,840
You know why?
Because we had to work for our porn!

735
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,160
We had to work for our porn.

736
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,120
Because I grew up in a time
before the Internet.

737
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,600
Before the Internet.

738
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,160
Right now, you can download your movies,
it's like a high speed Internet.

739
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,520
You don't even have to download,
you can stream.

740
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,240
We didn't have the Internet.

741
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,520
The only thing I had was the Avon catalog.

742
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,280
I remember the Avon catalog,
my mother was an Avon lady.

743
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,480
I used to steal the catalog,
run up to the toilet,

744
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,280
turn to page 32.

745
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,440
Bras and panties.

746
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,320
I remember very clearly, like, because...

747
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
Here's one thing you need to understand.

748
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,640
Like, Malaysia, we didn't have real women
modeling the bras and panties.

749
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,600
It was headless mannequins.

750
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,360
Right, we had to imagine the breasts.

751
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,320
Right, so we... And you know,
we had to work hard for our porn.

752
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,600
Like, do you guys remember
dial

753
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,480
Do you guys remember dial
Yeah.

754
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,720
You don't know pain.

755
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,200
You don't know pain
until you've had dial-up fucking Internet.

756
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Oh.

757
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,680
Dial-up Internet. It was so hard.

758
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,600
It was so hard, you had to wait

759
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,240
till three o'clock in the morning
to do anything questionable.

760
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,680
Because we all had one computer
in the hall.

761
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,520
The family computer.

762
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,360
Right.

763
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:44,120
I remember, because we... I had to wait
until three o'clock in the morning, right.

764
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,960
When everybody, my father was asleep,
my mother was asleep.

765
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,400
My dog was asleep.

766
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,320
Right, because... And my dad,

767
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,000
my dad had a very good
alarm system in the house.

768
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,120
Right, so, whenever we wanted
to go down the stairs,

769
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:59,280
he knew immediately
because we had creaky stairs.

770
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,280
Right, so every time...

771
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,240
He knew. He knew we were going.

772
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,840
But what we did was, me and my brother,

773
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,040
we came, we sat down,
we came up with a plan.

774
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,520
Right, we sat down,
we came up with a plan.

775
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,600
Right. Because we knew, my father
snores very loudly.

776
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,760
So what we did was, we timed our steps...

777
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,360
with the snoring.

778
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,080
Right, so every time...

779
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,360
But then, there was a flaw in the plan,
because, sometimes, sometimes,

780
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,240
my father would turn to his side
and stop snoring.

781
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,840
So, it was like...

782
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
And I was stuck there for hours.

783
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,480
And when we did finally get downstairs,
we had to turn on the computer.

784
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,000
Turn on the computer.

785
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,320
And then, half an hour later,
when the computer has started up.

786
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,240
Windows fucking NT.

787
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:12,200
Then we had to turn on
the loudest thing you have ever heard...

788
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,600
in your entire life.

789
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,480
Which was the 56K modem.

790
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,360
It sounds like you're molesting
a Decepticon, you know?

791
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,040
Why the hell did they have
to make it so loud?

792
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,400
Right. It was difficult
because you had to...

793
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,880
You... Oh, you couldn't download movies,
you couldn't download...

794
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,320
anything, you couldn't download
GIFs or so.

795
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,280
You had to download still pictures.

796
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,240
Still pictures, right?
Only pictures. Right.

797
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,680
Which is bad, because you had
to imagine the movements yourself.

798
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,720
Unless you're a little bit creative
and you download two pictures and go...

799
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,760
Which is very difficult, right?

800
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,880
Because you have to work the mouse
and the joystick at the same time.

801
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,560
Some kind of hand-eye coordination.

802
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,720
It took 20 minutes
to download one picture.

803
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,520
Twenty minutes to download one picture.

804
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,080
I only lasted for three.

805
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,480
Hey, I'm not ashamed to admit this.
I'm not ashamed to admit this.

806
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,080
I've masturbated
to Pamela Anderson's forehead

807
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,480
so many times.

808
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:43,680
I don't even know what she looks like.

809
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,760
But, yeah, VHS tape.
<i>Sorority Girls and the Creature from Hell.</i>

810
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,800
I remember, I was alone at home.

811
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:53,640
It was going to be...

812
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,480
a good day.

813
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,280
I went home, I made myself some Milo.

814
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,640
It was going to be...

815
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,360
a good day.

816
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,880
Put in the tape and start rewinding.

817
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,520
It was going to be a good day.

818
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,400
And then my mother...

819
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,560
comes home early from work that day

820
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,040
to spend more time with her son.

821
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,520
I know, right.

822
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:31,800
And that's when I learned
the most valuable lesson

823
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,080
I have ever learned in my entire life.

824
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,520
Which was...

825
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,120
VHS tapes never ejected in an emergency.

826
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,320
I remember my mom
coming in through the gate, and I'm like,

827
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,760
"Eject, eject, eject!"

828
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,440
Nothing came out. Great.

829
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,600
I'm like, I panicked, I panicked,
I turned everything off.

830
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,720
I turned on the TV, my mom walks in,
she's like, "Kavin, what are you doing?"

831
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,000
"I'm watching the news."

832
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,600
And she's like, "Kavin,

833
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,800
if you're watching the news,

834
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,400
why don't you have any pants on?

835
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,960
And why is there an Avon catalog
next to you?"

836
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,800
I ran upstairs.

837
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,080
I ran upstairs to the sanctuary
of my room.

838
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,400
As a 14-year-old boy,
the only sanctuary you have is your room.

839
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,600
Right?

840
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,800
And, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm not, I'm not a religious man.

841
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,760
But that day...

842
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,480
That day, I was a Catholic priest.

843
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,040
I was 14 years old and molesting myself.

844
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,360
Everybody, calm down.

845
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,400
I prayed, and I prayed, and I prayed.

846
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,680
I've never prayed so hard before
in my life.

847
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,360
I prayed that my mother
would not find the VHS tape

848
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,920
inside the VCR.

849
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,320
And when I needed Him the most,
ladies and gentlemen,

850
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,640
He did not answer my prayers.

851
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,400
Because my mother did not come home

852
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,520
to spend more time with her son, no.

853
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,400
She came home because she wanted
to watch her favorite Indian drama...

854
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,000
that she recorded the night before.

855
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,640
And she thought
the tape was already inside.

856
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,240
And she just presses play.

857
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,760
To be fair, she didn't realize
it was a different movie.

858
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,680
Right, for the first half an hour,

859
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,480
she didn't realize,
she was just looking at it, going...

860
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,800
"What happened to their saris?"

861
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,960
She called me downstairs.

862
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,360
She called me downstairs,
and she looked at me,

863
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,200
and she said, "<i>Sorority Girls
and the Creature from Hell."</i>

864
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,880
She had the tape in her hands,
suddenly ejected.

865
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,600
"<i>Sorority Girls
and the Creature from Hell.</i>

866
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,440
How dare you bring this into my house?

867
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,200
How dare you bring this into my house?"

868
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,680
And then she says
the most terrifying words

869
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,120
you can say to a 14-year-old boy.

870
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:26,800
Which is,
"Wait till your father comes home."

871
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,280
Well, that was terrifying...
That was terrifying for me.

872
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,560
Especially, because both my parents
used to beat me. Let's face it.

873
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,440
Both my parents
used to beat me all the time.

874
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,920
Right, and, to be fair,
I deserved most of the beatings.

875
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:44,920
Right. Because if I wasn't beaten,
I would not be here telling you jokes.

876
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,760
I'll be outside robbing you.

877
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,000
So, fair enough.
But my father was hardcore.

878
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,520
And my father was hardcore.

879
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,240
My father had two sons.
He sat us both down and said,

880
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:58,680
"The reason I had two sons,
is because, one day,

881
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,760
I know I'm gonna kill one of you."

882
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,520
And if I'm being honest,
I miss my brother.

883
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:17,040
I prayed and I prayed and I prayed
that my father would not come home.

884
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,120
I was the only child in the entire world

885
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,520
that prayed his father don't come home.

886
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,400
He did not answer my prayers.

887
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,120
Because my father
did come home that night.

888
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,960
And my mom obviously told him
the whole story.

889
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:37,080
She told him the whole story.
He knows what happened, right,

890
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:40,640
but he decided to ask me. Right.

891
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,880
<i>"Sorority Girls
and the Creature from Hell.</i>

892
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,600
What is this?"

893
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,520
I looked at him and said,
"It's a horror movie."

894
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,280
Because I had hope, right?

895
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,040
And that's when he looked at me, and said,

896
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:02,000
<i>"Sorority Girls
and the Creature from Hell.</i>

897
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,880
Horror movie, huh?

898
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,000
Let's watch it."

899
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,440
Right.

900
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:12,400
He puts in the tape
and starts rewinding it.

901
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,160
Here I am, with my father...

902
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,080
my mother,

903
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,400
my brother,

904
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,320
and my grandmother...

905
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,120
all watching porn.

906
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,680
Like it's some kind of family activity.

907
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,080
As you can imagine,
it was awkward as hell, right.

908
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,600
My mother was screaming,
"How dare you bring this into my house?

909
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,240
How dare you bring this into my house?"

910
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,600
My grandmother going,

911
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,120
"Why aren't they wearing any saris?"

912
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,560
My mother was screaming,
"How dare you bring this into my house?

913
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,160
How dare you bring this into my house?"

914
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,640
My brother was flipping through
the Avon catalog at this point.

915
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:57,440
"How dare you bring this into my house?

916
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,040
How dare you bring this into my house?"

917
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,120
My dog was humping my leg.

918
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,800
"How dare you bring this into my house?

919
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,560
How dare you bring this into my house?"

920
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,360
My father went, "Shut up!

921
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,080
The creature from hell
is not even out yet!"

922
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,320
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much
for listening to my stories.

923
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,920
Thank you so much
for making tonight so special.

924
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,160
Thank you, everyone.

925
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,200
Good night.
