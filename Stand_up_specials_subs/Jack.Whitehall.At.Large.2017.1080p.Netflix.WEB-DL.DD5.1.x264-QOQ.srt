1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,200
<span style="style.default_1"> Please welcome Jack Whitehall.</span>

2
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,560
Show business, baby.

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,560
Show business.

4
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,400
Wow! How amazing is this?

5
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,280
Here we are at the record
of my first ever Netflix special.

6
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,720
Yeah.

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,640
I don't know why I'm talking into this.
I'm on a head set.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,480
I doubt that's even on.
I doubt that is even...

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,040
I mean, not even plugged in.
Literally just a prop.

10
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
This is an international show.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,800
I've realized, right,
trying to do the international show,

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,640
that the cultural divide is
much greater than we think.

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,120
The biggest difference, I realize,
between us and our American cousins,

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,440
when I went to California,
was the attitude to drinking.

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,000
Completely different.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,880
I heard sentences in California
that I've never heard before. Like this:

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,320
"Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

18
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,840
Did you see Larry?

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,400
Larry had four glasses of wine
with dinner.

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,920
I think Larry...

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,520
may be an alcoholic."

22
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,240
Yes, I know.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,240
Four glasses of wine with dinner
in America: you're an alcoholic.

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,720
Four glasses of wine with dinner
in Britain: you're the designated driver.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,200
Nothing, though, sums up the differing
attitudes to drinking in the UK and the US

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,600
than what we encourage our children,
our little babies,

27
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,880
to leave out Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,280
Do you know what the kids in America
leave out Santa Claus on Christmas Eve?

29
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Milk and cookies.

30
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,400
"Hey, Santa, I'm gonna leave
this big old glass of milk.

31
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,440
It's packed full of calcium
so your bones can be strong and sturdy.

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,680
Love you, Santa. Santa Claus, love you.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
I love you, Santa Claus."

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,880
What do the children of Britain leave out
Santa Claus every Christmas Eve?

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,240
Sherry.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
Neat liquor,

37
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,840
which we have our children believe
Santa Claus is downing at every house,

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,480
whilst operating a sleigh.

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,200
"Could we leave him a cookie, Daddy?"

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,560
"No, eating's cheating, you bastard."

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,600
"Go grab some tinnies for the elves,
you little..."

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,560
"Daddy?"
"What?"

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,560
"Why am I American,
and you're from the north of England?"

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,160
"I don't know. Jack messed up your voice.

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,040
Now he's messing up mine.
I've gone Jamaican."

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
Every time.

47
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,200
I probably should have asked,
before I launched into all of that...

48
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,320
And before I ask you this question
as an audience as well,

49
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,080
I need you to understand
something very important.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,960
This...

51
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,720
is a safe space.

52
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,760
Seriously, OK? This is the trust tree.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,320
Everyone climbs and nobody falls.

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,120
Yeah, even I find that one
a bit camp, but...

55
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,200
Trust tree. OK? Safe space.

56
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,640
Do we have any non-drinkers in?

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,920
Burn the witch!

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,800
Sorry. Sorry.

59
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,399
Yes. That was very loud.

60
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,440
This guy nearly shat himself. I'm sorry.

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,520
I didn't meant that, madam. Sorry.
I have a huge amount of respect to you.

62
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,880
I come from a family of heavy drinkers.
My dad, he drinks a lot.

63
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,600
This is how big a drinker my dad is.

64
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,880
I took my dad to a McDonald's
the other day, for the first time ever.

65
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,160
He asked to see a wine list.

66
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,520
Very confusing, McDonald's.

67
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
They've got salads, carrot batons...
I swear, we are a year away from McQuinoa.

68
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,800
That's why I like KFC.
KFC, they know what they are.

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,480
There's no healthy options in a KFC.

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,880
No airs and graces with a KFC.

71
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,200
Here is some deep-fried shit
for you to eat out of a bucket.

72
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,920
We'll even chuck in a wet-wipe because
we can't trust you to wash your hands.

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
Go on, eat it piggy.

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,960
"I wonder what the Colonel's
secret blend of herbs and spices is."

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,520
Salt!

76
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,080
It's not rocket science.

77
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,400
I just want to make clear,
I've never complained in a restaurant.

78
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm British.
I would never complain in a restaurant.

79
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,920
If I'm with someone that complains
in a restaurant, I die inside.

80
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,440
"Don't say anything. Don't make a scene.
Just eat the nut, all right?

81
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,080
We have an EpiPen at home.
We will deal with it later.

82
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,960
What? No.
Everything's wonderful. She's loving it.

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,400
Her neck is always that big.
That's very normal."

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,080
Ex-girlfriend, Ella.

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Or Nut-Ella, as we used to call her.
No, no!

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,600
Oh, God rest her soul.

87
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,920
The other thing my dad can't get
his head round is technology.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,160
I've got a great prank that I play
on my dad. You've got to try this.

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,160
If your parent is a bit of a technophobe,

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,280
what I do, is I wait for my mum to buy
a new bit of machinery for their house.

91
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,680
Doesn't matter what it is:
laptop, coffee machine, new printer.

92
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,400
And then I tell my 76-year-old dad

93
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,480
that said piece of machinery...

94
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,000
is voice-activated.

95
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,760
Oh, my God, you have not known true joy

96
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,880
until you have seen a 76-year-old man tell
an electric blanket to go fuck itself.

97
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,720
I'm not being ageist, OK?

98
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,480
I think it's very important
that we respect our elders.

99
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,360
I was visiting my granny recently.
My dear old Nan.

100
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,440
You know. Got to check the will...

101
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,040
Check they're well.
Check that she is well.

102
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,280
My granny is very much
from a different generation.

103
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,840
Oh, my God, we were clearing out
her house the other day.

104
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,440
We found some quite dubious things
on her shelves.

105
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,320
Oh, dear.

106
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,200
I know. I know.

107
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,240
I took her aside. I was, like,
"Granny, come on. It is 2017.

108
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,080
Who is still using VHS?"

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,720
Yeah, the racist doll is not great either.

110
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,600
Also, this is exactly as I found it
in her house.

111
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,400
If you're going to have
your racist doll out on display,

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,520
which you shouldn't,

113
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,840
please do not have your racist doll
out on display

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,960
above your copy of Nelson Mandela's
<span style="style.default_1">Long Walk to Freedom.</span>

115
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,280
She's unbelievable, my granny.

116
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,520
She's in a nursing home now,
and she sits there in her commode.

117
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,960
You know, the chair
with the potty underneath it.

118
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,600
That's not the funny bit, mate!

119
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,240
She sits there on her potty, knitting,
watching<span style="style.default_1"> Murder She Wrote.</span> Right?

120
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,320
And she doesn't have a lot of fun.

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,960
And it got me thinking,

122
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,280
because I saw this article recently
about the writer, Aldous Huxley.

123
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,040
This is such bullshit. I saw a tweet.

124
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
Do you know what Aldous Huxley
asked for on his deathbed?

125
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,840
LSD.

126
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,240
Now that is the attitude
more old people need to be taking.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,799
More of the elderly need to start
experimenting with recreational drugs.

128
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm not saying do drugs
when you're younger. That's a bad idea.

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,679
You might get into them.

130
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,679
But when you're 85,
living in a nursing home,

131
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,320
fuck it!

132
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,480
If I lived in a nursing home
I'd get on it all the time.

133
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,680
Also, they've got the perfect set-up:

134
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,560
disposable income, nurses on call,
daytime television,

135
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,680
a chair you can shit yourself in...

136
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,480
It's bloody perfect.

137
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,800
I'm just bored of hearing people
talking about their grandparents

138
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,040
when they go, "How did your granny die?"

139
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,880
"She died in her sleep."

140
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,520
Like that's a good thing.

141
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,640
Who wants to die in their sleep?

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
I want my granny to go out
all guns blazing.

143
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,520
I want people to ask me,
"Jack, how did your granny die?"

144
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
"She dropped an E and had a stroke whilst
doing the worm to<span style="style.default_1"> Antiques Roadshow.</span> "

145
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,600
Don't do drugs, kids.
That's not what I'm saying.

146
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm not into the<span style="style.default_1"> drugas.</span>

147
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,080
I did have an experience recently.
I went away on a lads' weekend.

148
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,440
Oi, oi! Lads! Lads! Lads!

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,000
I was with Digby and Rupert and...

150
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,600
Quite the threesome...

151
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
That sounded less gay in my head.

152
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,680
That's the most overrated thing
in the world: the threesome.

153
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,440
Sorry, this is a bit of an aside.

154
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I had a threesome once, at school, OK?

155
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,240
It was with this beautiful
Italian exchange student called Maria

156
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,800
and this chap called Monkford, and...

157
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,840
No, you just get in each other's way.

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,840
Eventually I had to be, like, "I think
it's best if you leave us two together."

159
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,400
Fortunately, she was very understanding.

160
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,360
Monkford. Odd chap,
but a bloody good teacher.

161
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,320
So, lads' weekend. Lads' weekend, OK?

162
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,240
We went to Amsterdam.

163
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,800
So, we're in Amsterdam and me
and my chums, Rupes and Diggers,

164
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,120
we're down this kind of back street,

165
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,040
and one them, Diggers: naughty guy.

166
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
Diggers is smoking some of the weedy puff.

167
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,680
I'm not into it, as you probably guessed
by the fact that I called it weedy puff.

168
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,760
"Weed."
That's how normal people talk, Jack.

169
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,200
So he was smoking some weed,
and he turned to me and he went,

170
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,120
"Jack, do you want a suck on this?"
Not... not suck. Not suck.

171
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,040
That is not the word that he used.

172
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,920
That is not what he...

173
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,000
This is going well.

174
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,320
"I was with my friend
and he asked if I wanted to suck..."

175
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,720
That is not...

176
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,520
I'm having a brain burp.
Not suck. What's the word?

177
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,320
Puff! Thank you to the crack whore
down the front.

178
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,720
"Do you want a puff on this weed?"

179
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,360
Anyway, I said no because,
you know, we're in public.

180
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,520
It's not a great look.
What if someone sees?

181
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,800
He went, "Jack, two things.
Firstly, it's legal.

182
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,600
Secondly, we're in Holland.
No one knows who the fuck you are.

183
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,640
Smoke it."

184
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,800
Now, I'm not proud.
I gave in to the peer pressure.

185
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,120
This is why you cannot smoke a spliff
on the street in the year 2017.

186
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,600
I shit you not.

187
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
As I put this spliff to my lips
I looked up,

188
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,320
and the bloody Google Maps car
with the 360 camera was driving past.

189
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,840
I read something about Google
the other day.

190
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,560
You know last year, in the UK,
from advertising alone,

191
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,200
Google made 66 million pounds.

192
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,440
Which, after tax, is 66 million pounds.

193
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,360
We're going to some highbrow territory
this evening.

194
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,160
We have silliness and gimmicks
at the beginning,

195
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,000
but this is a sophisticated show.

196
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,760
I'm nearly 30 now. OK?

197
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,400
I had a dinner party the other night.
We talked about mortgage rates.

198
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,520
Sophisticated show
for a sophisticated audience.

199
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
So, dick pics...

200
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,720
This is actually a very serious story, OK?
Very serious story.

201
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,320
Because last year I had a dick pic scare.

202
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,400
Why is there laughing over there?

203
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,720
I said that this was a serious story

204
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,920
and if I'm going to share it with you,
there needs to be mutual respect.

205
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,080
Don't blow down the trust tree.

206
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,400
Serious story.

207
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,360
So, last year I had a dick pic scare.

208
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,640
A friend of mine calls me up.

209
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,040
He's, like, "Jack, there is a dick pic
of you circulating online."

210
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,080
Fucking watch it.

211
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,880
"There's a dick pic of you online."
I was so distressed.

212
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
"Oh, my God, this can't be happening."

213
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,960
Then I thought, wait a sec,
this really can't be happening.

214
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,720
I have never taken a photograph
of my penis in my life.

215
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,080
So, unless they've got hold
of Mr Monkford's laptop, this ain't me.

216
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,200
I call my agent. I'm very distressed.

217
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,760
I'm, like, "Make this go away.
Get a lawyer. Shut it down. Make it stop."

218
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,480
Hung up the phone.
So distressed. Heart pounding.

219
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,880
My friend sends me a link
to this dick pic.

220
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,760
I click on it.
Comes up on my computer screen.

221
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,360
I mean, 100%, this was not
a photograph of me.

222
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,320
But, my God, it was...

223
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,120
the most beautiful penis I've ever seen.

224
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,720
It was unbelievable.
It was long and tanned and sinuous.

225
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,960
It looked like Aslan's tail. Magical!

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,440
My agent called me back:
"What do you want to do?"

227
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,440
I was, like, "You know,
I think we should just leave it."

228
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,040
I was re-tweeting it.
I was favoriting it.

229
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,120
I made it my profile picture.
You've got to own these things.

230
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,440
Got to own these things.

231
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,360
This is the thing, OK.

232
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,760
I have had these scandals in my career,
and I'm always on the verge of another.

233
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,480
Because I put my foot in it.
I can't help it.

234
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,840
I nearly did it on a big scale last year.

235
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,440
Last year I was asked to host
the<span style="style.default_1"> Royal Variety Show.</span>

236
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,480
The prestigious, annual charity gala,
attended by a member of the Royal Family.

237
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,520
The year that I hosted it,
it was attended by Prince Harry.

238
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,680
I was, like,

239
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,320
"I'll start by paying Prince Harry
a compliment. Get him on side."

240
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,040
So I walked out. Five thousand people.
Black tie. Royal Albert Hall.

241
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,080
I was, like, "Your Royal Highness,
I would like to start

242
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,560
by complimenting you
on the bravery and the courage

243
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,880
that you showed in Afghanistan.

244
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,880
A ginger in that heat? Fuck me!"

245
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,920
I'm glad you laughed, because on the night
that one went down like a dead corgi.

246
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,120
From there on in, hard work.

247
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,600
End of the show, the one thing you've got
to do, as host of the<span style="style.default_1"> Royal Variety Show,</span>

248
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,240
is lead the cast in a bow
to the royal box.

249
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,800
So, I'm stood on stage, end of the show,

250
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,320
next to Sir Elton John,
national treasure,

251
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,360
and One Direction, regional trinkets,

252
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
and they're there, and they're there.

253
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,560
And do you know why I didn't
do the bow to the royal box?

254
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,520
Because Elton John, Sir Elton John,
national treasure,

255
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,400
a man who I have
never met before in my life,

256
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,760
thought it would be funny, live on TV,

257
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,360
in front of 5,000 people
at the Royal Albert Hall,

258
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,880
as I was about to bow to the royal box,

259
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,280
he leant in and whispered in my ear,

260
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,920
"I wouldn't bend over
in front of me, love."

261
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,400
And there's cameras everywhere.
They caught the exact moment he said it.

262
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,560
Pulled out of the bow.

263
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,960
So that was quite bad:
act of treason, live on stage.

264
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,640
It gets even worse.

265
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,240
Afterwards, they have
this black tie charity reception.

266
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
God, these stories are so relatable.

267
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,040
So, I stupidly decided
that I would invite,

268
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,440
as my plus-one to the charity reception,
my mate, Dave.

269
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,839
Some of them are laughing: "Jack,
you do not have a friend called Dave."

270
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,880
It's short for The Earl of Daventry.

271
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,839
OK, it's a fake name.
He's not called Dave.

272
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,920
I've given him a fake name for this story
because he doesn't come out of it great.

273
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,079
Now, what Dave is:
Dave is your dickhead friend.

274
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,599
So, I'm hanging out
with dickhead friend at the bar.

275
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,480
You don't hang out with a dickhead friend.
You man mark him.

276
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,800
So I'm man-marking dickhead friend
at the bar. Prince Harry walks over.

277
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,520
Prince Harry walks over
with two armed security personnel.

278
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,840
Just remember that for later on
in the story. These guys have guns.

279
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,160
So, he walks over.
Me and Gabe stood here, at the bar.

280
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,960
Dave, not Gabe.

281
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,040
That went well.

282
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,320
Give him a fake name and then
just say his actual name out loud.

283
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,520
What do I do? Do I start again?

284
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
Fuck. No...

285
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,600
I can't believe I've done that.

286
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,240
I normally do that story
and I just say his name,

287
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,600
and the Netflix lawyer was, like,
"You have to give him a fake name."

288
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,200
So I made up the name
and then I just said his actual name.

289
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,120
Can they beep it?

290
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,720
What have I done?

291
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,040
OK.

292
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,920
Well, his name isn't Dave.

293
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,320
His name is Gabe.
So, I guess we're going with Gabe.

294
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,360
Gabe Turner is his full name.

295
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,920
He's on Twitter.

296
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,080
This goes out all over the world.

297
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,920
He's gonna kill me.

298
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
OK. Sorry.

299
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,920
Stop crying and get on with the show.

300
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
OK. Right.

301
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,240
So, Prince Harry walks over to me
and Gabe Emmanuel Turner...

302
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,160
So, Gabe, Dave, whatever.
I've forgotten his name.

303
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,880
Gabe, OK, is a big guy.

304
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,160
He's got cauliflower ears, shaved head,
like, big rugby player, all right.

305
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,440
The kind of guy you wouldn't want
to throw under the bus.

306
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,080
Anyway, Gabe is a big guy.
Prince Harry walks over.

307
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,160
He decides he's gonna do a little joke.
He walks over.

308
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,480
He's, like, "Mr Whitehall,
is this your bodyguard?"

309
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,440
I was, like, "That's so funny, because
he's very tall. You're so amusing."

310
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,720
Probably cut that bit out as well.

311
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,160
So, no, the problem is,

312
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,960
I was so busy laughing
at Harry's little joke,

313
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,200
I didn't realize what was
unfolding next to me.

314
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,840
It was like one of those moments in life
where everything happens in slow motion.

315
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,200
I turned to my left.

316
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,880
I could see that my dickhead friend
was gearing up to drop a clanger

317
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,760
but there was nothing that I could do
to stop it from happening.

318
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,360
Do you know what his response was,
to getting called a bodyguard?

319
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,120
By the fifth in line to the throne?

320
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,960
At a black tie charity reception?

321
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,640
He went, "Oi oi, fuck off, Ron Weasley."

322
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,320
Shots fired. Shots fired.

323
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,120
To be fair to Harry, he leaves it
just long enough for me to think

324
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,600
that my friend is about to be executed
by the security services.

325
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,760
And then, cool as you like, goes,

326
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,880
"Well, I'd rather look like Ron Weasley
than Shrek."

327
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,080
Thanks to Gabe Turner,
my career over here was in tatters.

328
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,960
The knighthood was out the window.

329
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,800
I was never gonna be allowed
on TV ever again.

330
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,480
But I was, like, it's fine.

331
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,320
Because this is gonna be the year
that I break America.

332
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,480
No, don't whoo.
America, very much still intact.

333
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,800
I got an American manager.

334
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,240
Chad, the American manager.

335
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,280
Never heard more crap come out
of a man's mouth in my life.

336
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,080
"Kid, what you gotta think about me
is that I'm not your manager.

337
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,400
I'm your team mate. OK?
And there is no 'I' in team."

338
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,040
No, but there is one in "bullshit."

339
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,440
Tricked me into signing with him,
did Chad, as well.

340
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,600
He was, like, "You sign with me,
there is a movie with a part in it.

341
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,560
Oh, my God. This part, it was written
for you kid. It was written for you.

342
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,800
I represent the director.
You sign with me, the part is yours."

343
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,200
I was, like, "Great, thanks Chad.
Sign me up."

344
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,920
Joined the agency. Auditioned for the part
that was "written for me."

345
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,200
Didn't get it.

346
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
Went to see the film six months later.

347
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,840
Do you know who was playing the part
that was "written for me"?

348
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,720
Idris Elba.

349
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,400
Idris Elba.

350
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,200
I'm not having a pop.
Obviously, Idris is a great actor.

351
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,480
And in hindsight, he made a much better
Nelson Mandela than I would have.

352
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,360
"I have been on a long walk to freedom."
No, it wasn't right.

353
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,360
Don't do the voice.

354
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
It's not even the worst audition
Chad got me.

355
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,960
The worst audition came
when I was in America last.

356
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,120
Before I tell you what this was for,

357
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,840
I need to give some of you a little bit
of back-story about my acting career.

358
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,240
When I was at school
I was a big fan of drama.

359
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
I know. Shock, horror.

360
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,720
Not the only fan of drama, though.

361
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,280
The other guy that was
really into drama at my school

362
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,640
was a chap called Robert Pattinson.

363
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,360
There he is. Young R Patz,
star of the<span style="style.default_1"> Twilight</span> films.

364
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,560
And, every time there was
a school play at my school,

365
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,280
Robert Pattinson would get cast
in the lead role,

366
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,280
and villager 17...

367
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,360
would go to this guy.

368
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,320
Yeah. Laugh it up!

369
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,120
For some reason, my drama teacher
wanted the star of his play

370
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,840
to be the young James Dean
and not the young K D Lang.

371
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,680
It's fair to say that, over the years,
I've built up resentment towards R Patz.

372
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,960
He became my rival.

373
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,120
Rival's a strong word.

374
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,160
Nemesis.

375
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,840
He is my nemesis.

376
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,040
I've made jokes about him before.

377
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,440
I've called him a wooden actor.
I've written an entire show about him.

378
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,120
I have milked that titty dry

379
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,360
for every droplet
of its bitter, bitter milk.

380
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,520
Eventually, one day I was, like,
"You need to put that anger away in a box.

381
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,640
You need to hide it away
and you need to get on with your life."

382
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,600
And I vowed that I would never speak about
Robert Pattinson on stage ever again.

383
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,160
And it was going really well.

384
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,480
Until Chad called me up out of the blue.

385
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,920
He was, like, "Kid, oh, my God,
I got you an audition for a movie.

386
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,720
This part is amazing, and get this:

387
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,480
in this movie you would be
starring opposite...

388
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,000
Robert Pattinson."

389
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,240
OMG.

390
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,040
FML.

391
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,640
WTF.

392
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,760
And, you know what the word was
that chimed? "Opposite."

393
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,240
Not below. Not beneath.
Not behind Robert Pattinson.

394
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,160
Opposite Robert Pattinson.

395
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,440
After all these years
of feeling inadequate,

396
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,200
finally, me and my nemesis
were on a level playing field

397
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,640
and it felt amazing.

398
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,600
I was, like, "Chad, tell me
about the part. What are we?

399
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,160
A couple of swashbuckling heroes?
You know, good cop, bad cop?

400
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,120
Two dashing gents competing
for the hand of a fair maiden?"

401
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,360
He went, "No, not quite.

402
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,680
In this movie, you would be playing Matt,
and Matt..."

403
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,520
Get ready for it.

404
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,280
"Matt is Robert Pattinson's character's

405
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,720
mentally handicapped brother."

406
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Yes.

407
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,840
I thought it was a tasteless joke as well.

408
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,880
Ten minutes later,
that dropped into my inbox.

409
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,360
It was a genuine audition to play
the younger brother of Robert Pattinson

410
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,720
with, to use the politically correct term,
Chad, learning difficulties.

411
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,440
I had to go away and have
a little think about this offer.

412
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,880
I told my friends.
They all thought it was hilarious.

413
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,040
I told my father.

414
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,640
My father, slightly more pragmatic
about the whole situation.

415
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,520
He went, "Well,
you've got to go for it, son.

416
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,480
Those kind of parts are Oscar bait."

417
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,600
"Look at history:
<span style="style.default_1">What's Eating Gilbert Grape,</span>

418
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,560
<span style="style.default_1">Rain Man, Forrest Gump...</span>

419
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,280
You know what they say, son:
play a mong, get a gong."

420
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,520
No, they do not say that.

421
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,360
You have just said that.

422
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,080
But, here's where the ego of the actor
kicks in.

423
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,600
Within about five minutes I'm thinking,
"Well, he has got a point.

424
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,440
This is my chance to prove to the world
that I'm a serious actor.

425
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm taking the audition."

426
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,920
It was the weirdest audition
I have ever done.

427
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,880
The first thing that was unusual
about this audition

428
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,720
is that there was no script.

429
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,120
I was told that I would just have to walk
into the room, with the casting director,

430
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,320
and improvise in character.

431
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,520
Well, I had to ask some questions.

432
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,600
I went in.
The casting director was there.

433
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,880
I was, like, "Um, hello,

434
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,800
I just needed to know, um,

435
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,360
how...

436
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,280
mentally, you know...

437
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,120
do you want me to be?"

438
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,360
He said,
"What you're doing now is fantastic."

439
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,040
I haven't started!

440
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,840
The note that came back was amazing.
They referred me to the original email.

441
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,720
"What we want from your character,

442
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,720
everything about him should be
dulled and emotionless.

443
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,680
From facial expressions
to the tone of his voice."

444
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,840
I said, "Is it not gonna look weird

445
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,720
if I'm doing the exact same thing
as Robert Pattinson?"

446
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,960
Burn! Yeah.

447
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,240
Yeah, I didn't get the part.

448
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,960
It's fine. It's fine. I didn't want it.

449
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,160
My career as an actor
has all been about the near misses.

450
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,200
<span style="style.default_1">Harry Potter.</span> I auditioned
for<span style="style.default_1"> Harry Potter</span> when I was 11.

451
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,440
Got so close and was just pipped
to the post by that bitch, Emma Watson.

452
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,920
<span style="style.default_1">Frozen.</span> Oh, my gosh.
That was another Chad classic, OK?

453
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Chad calls me up out of the blue.

454
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,760
"Kid, I know you love Disney movies.
How would you like to be in<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen?</span> "

455
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,720
I was, like, "My God,
which princess am I playing?"

456
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,280
He went, "You're gonna be a troll."
Fine. I'll be a troll.

457
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
I played Gothi the Troll in<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen.</span>

458
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,560
Yeah. We all remember
Gothi the Troll from<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen.</span>

459
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
One of the main parts. Yeah.

460
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,400
One line in<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen.</span>

461
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,680
This was my one line in<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen.</span> Ready?

462
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,400
"I trollfully bid you farewell."

463
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,960
Don't all applaud at once. Jesus.

464
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,880
I'm well aware of how pathetic it was.

465
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,920
But I was so excited about
my one little part in<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen.</span>

466
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
I went in. I nailed it.

467
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,160
I left that sound studio. I told everyone
that I was gonna be in<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen.</span>

468
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,960
"Gonna be the star of a Disney film.
Grab a selfie while you can."

469
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,440
Film comes out.
I am watching<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen</span> on the screen.

470
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,560
It gets to the bit
in the enchanted forest.

471
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,680
I see my character there in front of me.

472
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,960
Gothi the Troll, the fat little fucker,
right there.

473
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,080
He clears his throat.

474
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,480
He goes to speak,

475
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,080
and the camera cuts away to Princess Elsa.

476
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,440
And she starts singing some
lame Disney song about being a princess.

477
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,960
I'm sorry. I was shouting at the screen.

478
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,160
I was, like,
"Oi, excuse me, Elsa, zip it, bitch.

479
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,160
Gothi had something to say."

480
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,520
Well, I'm asked to leave the cinema.

481
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,160
I call Chad.
I'm, like, "Chad, what happened?

482
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,400
I was just watching<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen</span>
and my line does not appear to be in it."

483
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,200
He was, like, "Oh, kid, I'm so sorry.
I forgot to tell you.

484
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,240
Disney called and, unfortunately,

485
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,920
your part in the movie
has been reduced to a non-speaking role."

486
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,800
"A non-speaking role?

487
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,280
Chad, it is an animation.

488
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,840
That means I'm not in it."

489
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,760
"Hey kid, calm down.
You've got to just... let it go."

490
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,320
"Let it go?
Don't give me 'let it go'!"

491
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,320
"Like, it's fine.
It's gonna look great on your IMDb."

492
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,480
"Oh, it's gonna look great on my IMDb,
is it, Chad?

493
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:48,320
It's gonna look good that I'm
the 81st listed cast member of 82?

494
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,680
I'm below the guy that made the
grunting noises for the fucking reindeer."

495
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,840
"Uncredited."

496
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,600
That is the only evidence
that my performance in<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen</span> exists.

497
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,360
Which is probably for the best,
given the circumstances.

498
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,640
Thank God there is not a picture of me
doing a press interview

499
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,520
in front of a poster for a film
that I'm not in.

500
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
Oh, wait, no. There is.

501
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,200
A picture of me doing an interview
for a film that I'm not in.

502
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,160
And look at that smug face, as well.

503
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,480
You're not in the film, mate.

504
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,320
And that would be fine, if it had
never seen the light of day again.

505
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,360
But, as we've already established,
some of my friends are dickheads.

506
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,920
And one dickhead friend in particular,

507
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,640
Mr Gabe Turner,

508
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,200
found out about
the existence of this picture

509
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,880
and thought it would be funny
to share it all over social media.

510
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,360
Not only that:

511
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,840
Gabe figured that if I was promoting
this film that I'm not in,

512
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,200
maybe there are other films
that I'm also not in,

513
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,240
that I could have been promoting.

514
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:08,840
So, the following day, I log onto Facebook
and this is on his wall.

515
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,640
The next day, I log onto Facebook,
and that is on his wall.

516
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,840
And this is the best one.
Time and effort has gone into making it.

517
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,080
On the third day I log onto Facebook
and that is on his bloody wall.

518
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,680
The troll got trolled.

519
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,520
It's been a challenging year, because
I love Disney more than anyone else.

520
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,600
I love Disney so much,
but it's been challenged this year.

521
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,920
The other thing: I went to America.

522
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,480
I was staying in a hotel for two months
and they messed up my booking.

523
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,160
I check in. They're, like, "Sir, there has
been an error with your booking.

524
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,560
It doesn't matter, though.
We're gonna pop you in our sister hotel."

525
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,720
Well, it turned out their sister hotel...

526
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,280
was the Disney hotel,
in Disneyland, Anaheim,

527
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,160
where they were expecting me to live
for two months of my life.

528
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,280
I went, "No, unfortunately
that cannot happen.

529
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,560
I cannot live in Disneyland
because I am a grown man."

530
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,640
I came to America because
I wanted to be put onto a TV show,

531
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,720
not the sex offenders register.

532
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,200
And, don't get me wrong, I love hotels.
I love staying in hotels.

533
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I love staying in hotels for the same
reason that we all love staying in hotels:

534
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,560
I love stealing from hotels.

535
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,800
And I'm so good at it as well.
I've got it down to a fine art.

536
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,760
They've got their little tricks to try
and stop us from nicking their shit.

537
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,000
You go into the bathroom

538
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,800
and they've got the shower gel
mounted on a wall bracket,

539
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,360
which is why I always take a drill.

540
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,480
Or the little passive-aggressive notes.

541
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,160
Have you been into one of those?
I was staying in one.

542
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,080
I open the cupboard. They've got this:

543
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,640
"If you would like this robe,
it will cost you 30 pounds."

544
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,040
So I nicked it and left that.

545
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,960
Another one they've got
in the Disney hotel:

546
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,520
Disney characters,

547
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,080
embroidered onto all of the towels.

548
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,880
Yes. I know.

549
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,360
That sounds sweet,

550
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,400
until you're drying your bollocks
on the face of the old man from<span style="style.default_1"> Up.</span>

551
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,360
Just there in the bathroom,
tea-bagging a grieving pensioner.

552
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,600
"Oh, God...

553
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,360
I'm sorry about your wife."

554
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,520
There's too much Disney
in the Disney hotel.

555
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,480
This is the problem. They've got
Disney characters on all of the walls.

556
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,920
Disney wallpaper, Disney bedlinen,
Disney music in the elevators.

557
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,800
Disney characters,

558
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,800
that work at the hotel
as members of staff.

559
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,720
All the main ones.
You know: Cinderella, Aladdin.

560
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,560
Gothi the Troll...
All the famous ones that we love.

561
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,040
And they're not allowed to break character
at any point during your stay.

562
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,000
Have you got any idea
how fucking annoying that is?

563
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,560
I nearly turned into Jack Nicholson
from<span style="style.default_1"> The Shining.</span>

564
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,200
You check in and Goofy's on reception.

565
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,040
In the restaurant,
Donald Duck's manning the carvery.

566
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,720
I can pinpoint, though,
the exact moment...

567
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,200
that my childhood died.

568
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,560
I'd been there for two weeks.

569
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,000
I'm in my room. I'm tired. I'm alone.

570
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,640
I call down to the front desk.

571
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,840
Mickey Mouse answers the phone.

572
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,200
"Hey, hey, hey buddy.
What can I do for you today?"

573
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,040
"Mickey...

574
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,400
I need to activate the porn channels
on my TV."

575
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,360
Inner child: dead.

576
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,200
You don't want this.
These are your heroes.

577
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,560
Having an argument with Simba
at the front desk

578
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,360
about your itemized bill.

579
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,200
"I want to speak with someone more senior.
Fetch me...

580
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,120
Mufasa."

581
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
Not good at complaining.

582
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,240
There's certain situations in life, right,
where every time I fall apart.

583
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,640
Complaining is one of them.

584
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,600
Passport control.
That's another. Can't do it.

585
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,800
And I don't have anything to hide.

586
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,440
It doesn't help that I have
the creepiest passport photo

587
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,120
that has ever been taken.

588
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,000
People, thinking you've got
a bad passport photo,

589
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,120
you have not seen anything yet.

590
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,080
Brace yourselves...

591
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,920
for this shit.

592
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,920
What is that?

593
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,280
I look like I've just taken
Liam Neeson's daughter.

594
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,960
Yes. Very funny.
"Benedict." We can all read.

595
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,520
So, every time I approach
passport control, that is in my head.

596
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,080
I'm about to hand that over.

597
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,840
It does not excuse how much I fall apart
under the most basic of questioning.

598
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,040
I walk up. I'm, like, "Hello."

599
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,960
"Where are you traveling from?"
"France... no, Spain.

600
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,880
Shit, sorry, Italy. Didn't sleep on the
plane. Drugs didn't work.

601
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,800
Not drugs, drugs.
I mean, drugs like sleeping pill drugs.

602
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,000
I don't have any drugs on me.
I'm not a mule. Don't look at my bottom.

603
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,200
I have explosive diarrhea...
Not like a bomb.

604
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,560
Shit! Just said 'bomb'.
Well, it's just a word.

605
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,560
The more you say it, the less offensive
it becomes. Bomb!

606
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,200
Bomb, bomb, bomb! You're all
looking at me like I'm a terrorist.

607
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,160
I promise you, I'm not a terrorist.
I'm just plain old Jack.

608
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,960
'Hi, Jack.' Not hijack. Shit!
No, don't shoot!"

609
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,120
Here's another one
I've never understood at airports.

610
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,560
Why do people think it's acceptable
to cut in line at airports?

611
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,440
Never acceptable to barge the line.
All right?

612
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
Some people think there are exceptions.

613
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,880
Like, if you're late.

614
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,760
Not an excuse.

615
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,800
I was waiting to check in,
in the airport.

616
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,240
This woman comes barging to the front

617
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,880
and proffers this bullshit:

618
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,000
"Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

619
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,680
I've got to get a flight."

620
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,080
Well, no shit, Sherlock.

621
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,520
We're in a fucking airport.

622
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,720
Why do you think I'm here?
To buy a big Toblerone?

623
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,840
Please, let me get out of your way
with these bags which I take everywhere.

624
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,800
Back of the line!

625
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,840
Is what I wanted to say.

626
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,400
Unfortunately, as I'm British,
that came out as:

627
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,840
"Please, after you... dickhead."

628
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,280
The celebrity queue-barge.
Not acceptable.

629
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,040
I've seen that happen first-hand.

630
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,560
I was in Disneyland, the park.
Thunder Mountain.

631
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,760
Got to make the most of these situations.

632
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,760
In the line, 30 minutes.

633
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,920
All of a sudden,
this little jumped-up Disney star,

634
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,120
this little, kind of,
precocious Justin Bieber type,

635
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,280
with his entourage,

636
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,240
swept to the front of the queue.

637
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,880
All the Americans were fine with it.
I'm sorry. I'm British.

638
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,400
I had to say something.

639
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,240
I had a full-blown argument
with his manager, then and there.

640
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,120
She kept name-dropping
this show that he was on,

641
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,760
like I gave a shit.

642
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,600
She kept going, "He is from Make a Wish."

643
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,920
I was, like, "Never heard of it."

644
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,160
Arrogant little bastard wearing a cap
so no one would recognize him.

645
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,160
She kept going, "He's not got long."

646
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,680
I'm, like, "We've all got
places to be, love."

647
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,120
Well, that one divided the room.

648
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Don't worry. That is a joke.
I didn't actually say that.

649
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,000
But I thought of it.

650
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,760
So I'm going to hell.

651
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,320
I hate travelling.

652
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:28,000
The other reason I hate travelling is,
I can't sleep in public.

653
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,560
And I can't sleep in public
because I sleep with my eyes open.

654
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,000
Medical condition,
not just a habit from boarding school:

655
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,120
"Watch it."

656
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,440
Four percent of the population sleep
with their eyes open. Anyone else? No one.

657
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,440
There might be.
We don't know they've nodded off.

658
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:57,760
If I fall asleep with my contact lenses in
it's pretty peculiar.

659
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,120
A friend of mine took a photograph of me
passed out in public.

660
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,600
This is the look.

661
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,800
Oh, yeah. Hello, ladies!

662
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,160
Such an embarrassing photo
for me to show you.

663
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,320
Please don't tell anyone
that I was on a bus.

664
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,960
It's so bad, this situation, so bad,

665
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,760
that someone complained about me
once on a plane.

666
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,360
I know. I was, like,
"It is a medical condition, OK?"

667
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,600
But, looking back on it now,

668
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,280
I can see it from
my fellow passenger's perspective.

669
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,640
Because he did not know
that I slept with my eyes open.

670
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Also,

671
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,520
not the only trick that my body
plays on me when I fall asleep.

672
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,600
Yeah. A couple of you
are ahead of me here.

673
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,120
I imagine, for my fellow passenger,
it was quite unnerving

674
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,800
that, for the duration
of a three-hour flight,

675
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,280
every time he turned to his left,

676
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:57,400
the passenger in the seat next to him
appeared to be slumped there,

677
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,240
gazing into his eyes,

678
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,640
drool tumbling from my bottom lip,

679
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,240
nursing a semi.

680
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,360
I hate travelling on the plane so much.

681
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,200
I'm a nervous flyer as well.

682
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,240
And I don't think they do enough
to help us nervous flyers.

683
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:27,240
Safety demonstration.
Can we drop that already?

684
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:31,720
Why do we have to start every flight
with them performing a little pantomime

685
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,200
entitled,<span style="style.default_1"> The Horrific Ways</span>
<span style="style.default_1">You Could Die on This Plane</span>.

686
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,280
Also, if you're gonna keep it, update it.

687
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,720
I think I speak for us all when I say,

688
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:44,920
we have got the seat belt fastening down.

689
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,720
We have a routine on planes.

690
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,320
And everyone's used to the routine,
so no one questions it.

691
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,040
Well, I'm the guy
who questions the routine.

692
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,520
Finally, this is some relatable material.
Air travel: we all do that.

693
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,800
Jack Whitehall, everyman comedian.

694
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,200
Relatable.

695
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,280
So, I'm in my flat bed on the top deck...

696
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,000
...doing something that we've all done
loads of times on the plane.

697
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,760
Drinking a glass of champagne.
No, no.

698
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:20,960
Lifting up the blind
for take-off and landing.

699
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,920
And, for the first time ever,
I decided I would ask the stewardess

700
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,960
why I had to lift up the blind
for take-off and landing.

701
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,280
It is a question...

702
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,080
that I regret asking.

703
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,640
Because I have fact-checked her response,

704
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:42,360
and this is the genuine reason
on the Civil Aviation website.

705
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,960
I said, "Madam, out of interest,

706
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,680
why do...

707
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,160
I have to lift up the blind,

708
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,200
for take-off and landing?"

709
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,560
She looked at me.

710
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,320
Do you know what she said?

711
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,080
She went, "Well, sir,

712
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,400
if something were to go wrong
with the engine,

713
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,760
then you are the pilot's eyes."

714
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,280
I beg your fucking pardon?

715
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,000
I'm not ready
for that level of responsibility.

716
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,040
And no one told me that
when I purchased the ticket.

717
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,680
I was very much under the impression
that I was travelling as a passenger,

718
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,480
not bloody co-pilot.

719
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,600
Also, I think you may have
picked the wrong guy.

720
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,960
I'm the guy you want,
keeping an eye out for engine failure?

721
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,240
This guy is your look out? Really?

722
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,360
Also, how does that scenario play out
in your head

723
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,040
while we're nosediving towards the ground?

724
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,680
I look out of the window and see
smoke billowing from the engine.

725
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,280
I'm meant to just amble up to the cockpit,
put my head through the door:

726
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,120
"Awfully sorry, gents.
Your eyes in the back, here.

727
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,880
I don't know whether you're aware of this
but one of the wings has fallen off.

728
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,320
You might want to buckle up.

729
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,960
I will send someone through
to show you how it's done. Thank you."

730
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,760
"The pilot's eyes"!

731
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:06,000
I'll be the pilot's flapping asshole,
all right?

732
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,440
I don't want any responsibility
on a plane.

733
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,120
Like the emergency exit row seat.

734
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,560
That one with the leg room.

735
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,400
Does anyone take that when they fly?

736
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,920
Oh, you're braver than me.

737
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,880
No amount of leg room in the world

738
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,600
is worth that level of responsibility.

739
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,520
Because I've sat in that seat.
I know what happens.

740
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,800
She comes up to you, the stewardess,
at the beginning of the flight.

741
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,280
She goes, "Sir, if we needed you to,

742
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,200
could you open that door?"

743
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,120
And you go...

744
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:41,920
"Yep."

745
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,720
And that's it.

746
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:50,080
There is no training
or psychological assessment.

747
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,400
If that's an important job,
which I suspect it is,

748
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,600
I want the people to be screened.
I want there to be an auditioning process.

749
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,920
I want to meet every fucker on the plane
and take a vote.

750
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,280
It cannot just come down to the person

751
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,880
that was willing to pay 15 quid more.

752
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,320
Do you ever see the person in that seat
and think, "Fucking really?"

753
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,800
I was walking onto the plane
the other day.

754
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,880
The guy in the exit row seat

755
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,280
had spilt a milkshake all down his front.

756
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,560
I stopped dead in my tracks.
Is this a wind-up?

757
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,280
This is the guy,

758
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,280
when the shit hits the fan at 30,000 feet,

759
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:30,640
our lives are in the hands
of fucking Milkshake Mike over here?

760
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,960
He's gonna open that door?
The guy can't even open a bloody Nesquik.

761
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,080
I take myself out of the equation. Right?

762
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,840
Because I can't trust myself.

763
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,680
Because we don't know
what we'd be like in an emergency

764
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,760
until it happens.

765
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,520
Yes, we all like to think we'd be a hero.

766
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,680
We all like to think we'd be the person

767
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,040
that would be tearing off that door,

768
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,560
picking up little old ladies,

769
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,600
sending them down the inflatable slide.

770
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,720
I'm not sure that's how you do it.

771
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,560
But there is a strong possibility that,
in fact, in an emergency situation,

772
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,320
I would be the kind of person

773
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,840
that would be hurling women and children
out of the life raft

774
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,680
to make room for my luggage.

775
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,760
I've never paddled a boat.
That's what we've learnt!

776
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,040
It's like a gondola. What the fuck?

777
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,720
I could be a bastard. I don't know.

778
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,120
In fact, I think I do know. I would be.

779
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,800
That's the only bit I do like
about safety demonstration:

780
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,160
"Please make sure you attach
your oxygen mask before helping others."

781
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,680
Yep, not gonna be a problem.

782
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,000
"We meant children." Yeah.

783
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:03,440
The only way I am attaching
an oxygen mask to a child before me

784
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,080
is if it's a fat kid
that I can use as an airbag.

785
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,440
Wow. That's the one that got you.

786
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,160
Make a Wish? Fine.
Fat kids? No.

787
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,480
I'm in a... relationship.

788
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,400
A long-term relationship,

789
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,280
We're getting to that stage
where she's dropping hints.

790
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,720
We're not married yet.

791
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,880
Posh girls are the worst for hints.

792
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,440
Five years in, girlfriend turns to me.
She's, like:

793
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,080
"I can't keep introducing you
as my boyfriend. That sounds so childish.

794
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,680
I could call you my partner,
but that's quite formal.

795
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,120
Lover?

796
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,800
Soulmate?"

797
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,040
I was, like, "Landlord is fine."

798
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:50,360
"Landlord? And I'm your tenant?"

799
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:52,680
I was, like, "No, tenants pay rent.

800
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,880
You're a squatter."

801
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,200
It's fine.

802
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,200
That actual girlfriend was evicted,
and the current...

803
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,320
My current girlfriend is great.
She doesn't pressure me.

804
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,120
We have big conversations.

805
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,160
The kid conversation keeps coming up.

806
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,880
I'm not sure whether I'm necessarily ready
to have a child at the moment.

807
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:19,280
Someone sniggering at the idea
of me reproducing.

808
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,720
Thank you very much for laughing at that.
But you're right.

809
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,760
I can't even look after a phone.

810
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,360
And you drop a phone,
you can get a new one.

811
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,080
Doesn't work like that with kids.

812
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,080
Same goes with upgrades.
You get a slow one, you're stuck with it.

813
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:44,280
That... that was amazing.

814
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:46,920
As I told that joke, I looked over there

815
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,400
and saw a Dad point at his son.

816
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,040
That's made my night.
Thank you very much.

817
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,680
Oh, no.

818
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,400
What just happened there:
I remembered what the next joke is.

819
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,400
And if you didn't like that one,
you're gonna hate this one.

820
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,320
Just can't do it.

821
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,040
Go on!

822
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,720
I'm gonna do it, obviously. Obviously.

823
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,880
If they don't like it, it's your fault.
Peer pressure, OK?

824
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:24,800
OK. Now I've got it. I've got it.

825
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,280
OK, we're talking about having kids
and I'm in bed with my girlfriend.

826
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,400
These are just jokes. It's all fun.

827
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,880
I'm sweating.

828
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,000
Right. I'm lying in bed with my girlfriend
and she turns to me.

829
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:42,480
Sorry. She didn't do that.

830
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,200
"What? What's happening?"

831
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,800
Lying in bed, she turns to me,

832
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,280
and she throws this curve-ball at me:

833
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:53,960
"Jack, would you ever consider adoption?"

834
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,720
I went, "Well, only if you got pregnant."

835
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,760
All my friends now,
they're all getting kids.

836
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,600
Loads of them are getting married.
Loads of my mates are getting married now.

837
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,960
I lost four friends last year.

838
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,040
That sounds like
I'm never gonna see them again.

839
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,000
Statistically, two of them
will come crawling back.

840
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,400
Realistically, four.

841
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,000
I don't object to people's happiness.

842
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:35,200
What I object to is their delusion
of my level of interest in it, sometimes.

843
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,800
Wedding lists. Oh, the wedding register.

844
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,040
That is the worst.

845
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,840
The first time I got a wedding list
through, I thought it was a wind-up.

846
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:46,680
These are grown adults.

847
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,080
"Here is a list
of the gifts that we want."

848
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:53,200
I had to run to the mirror to see whether
I'd grown a beard and a fucking sleigh.

849
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,440
I always get to it late as well,
when there's only two things left,

850
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,280
and all you can get them
is a butter knife or a yacht.

851
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,520
The problem: these people
are taking the piss.

852
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,800
It's bad enough when it's
something mundane, like plates.

853
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,600
They wanted plates the other day.

854
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,200
You didn't have those before?

855
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,600
"Yes, we just thought it was time to stop
eating our food directly off the table."

856
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,880
Or when they go high-end,
that's even worse.

857
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,360
My friend from university,
my best mate from uni,

858
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,360
on his wedding list is asking

859
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,960
for a Royal Albert tea set.

860
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:30,960
I'm, like, "Mate, I've seen you eat
Cheerios out of a slipper."

861
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:39,720
Forty quid as well,
for the Royal Albert tea set. No way.

862
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,120
In the end, I gave him a kettle
and some mugs that I got for free.

863
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
Thank you, Travelodge.

864
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,920
The only thing that I like about weddings,
and you must have seen this. It's so good.

865
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,280
The best thing about going to a wedding

866
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,560
is bumping into a bloke

867
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,560
that you met on the stag weekend,

868
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,120
that is now...

869
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,800
with his missus.

870
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,600
Complete transformation.

871
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,360
Gone is the swaggering and posture.

872
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,520
Now his whole body is crumpled
like a paper cup.

873
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:23,640
The<span style="style.default_1"> Borat</span> mankini has been folded away
for a rainy day.

874
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,480
Now, a neatly steamed suit.

875
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,280
Best still, is when the voice has changed.

876
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,840
All of a sudden,
because they're with their missus,

877
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,920
they've started talking
like they're in<span style="style.default_1"> Pride and Prejudice.</span>

878
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,960
You walk over: "Oi, oi, Stevie-boy,
the lager monster!"

879
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,440
"Greetings and salutations, Jack.

880
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,080
May I introduce you
to my radiant fiancée, Claire?"

881
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,960
"Oh, the fun vacuum."

882
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,760
"What? Oh. No, no."

883
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,840
"You made that joke: she's
the only vacuum that doesn't suck."

884
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,280
"The vicar's sermon was wonderful.
It nearly moved me to tears."

885
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,840
"Funny, that, because
the last time I saw you crying

886
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,800
you were led down some stairs in Estonia
by a prostitute with an Adam's apple."

887
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,400
I can't handle them. I can't handle stags.

888
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,600
Every stag I've ever been on,

889
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,120
there's always one member of the group

890
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,120
that reveals a true darkness

891
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,560
in their soul.

892
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,200
It's always the one
you least suspect, isn't it?

893
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,120
It's always the quiet one.

894
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,520
The groom's "friend from home."

895
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,840
"This is my mate Colin."

896
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,440
"Hello!

897
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,680
Oh, the journey I had down here.

898
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,480
The Hanger Lane gyratory
was chock-a-block.

899
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:42,440
Thankfully, I had my good friend
Classic FM to keep me company."

900
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,560
Yeah, got Colin down: wearing a fleece,
just ordered a Sprite.

901
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,120
Bit of a square,
but probably a decent enough guy.

902
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,040
Cut to five hours later.

903
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,560
Colin is being escorted
out of a TGI Friday's

904
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,480
for shitting in a woman's handbag.

905
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:04,000
The stag-do kitty. That's never worked
in the history of mankind.

906
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,720
The stag-do kitty.

907
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,280
"Yeah, chaps, we're all
gonna pay into the kitty,

908
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,000
and then this kitty will last all of us
for the entire weekend."

909
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,080
Gone within 20 minutes.

910
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,000
"What? There was a grand in there."

911
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,320
"Oh, yeah, sorry, Colin bought a gun.

912
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,800
He's fucking weird."

913
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:27,320
Then the journey back from the stag:
the most depressing flight in existence.

914
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,400
You're all there, on the plane.
Shivering wrecks.

915
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,440
Like broken men returning from war.

916
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,400
The deafening silence
throughout the fuselage

917
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,360
of a thousand stories
that can never be told.

918
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,560
You're sober
for the first time in 72 hours

919
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,480
and now, only too aware
that you're sat in public

920
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:48,360
wearing a T-shirt that says
"Lord Bumalot."

921
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,840
You think it's bad for you?

922
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,320
You turn to the back of the plane
and there he is.

923
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,760
Colin, strapped into his seat
like Hannibal Lecter.

924
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:01,880
He's got a black eye,
a criminal conviction and hepatitis B.

925
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,960
The fear slowly creeping across his face
that, come Monday morning,

926
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,760
it's back to work,
teaching in his primary school.

927
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,440
There's women laughing. I can see
their faces as I'm doing this routine.

928
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,320
They're laughing,
but looking down their noses at us.

929
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,120
They are tutting away, going,
"Oh, you boys, why do you do it?"

930
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:25,120
You know why you don't
have a leg to stand on, ladies?

931
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,720
Because whereas, on a stag weekend,
one of us turns out to be Colin,

932
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,280
on a hen weekend,

933
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,640
you're all Colin.

934
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,640
So, I go to a lot of weddings.

935
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,800
I went to my first Muslim wedding
the other day.

936
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,760
That was an experience.

937
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,800
I learnt the exact extent
of my religious tolerance that day.

938
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,240
It's got quite tense in here.

939
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,240
Don't worry. Me at a Muslim wedding:
what could go wrong?

940
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,240
So we arrived at this wedding.
It was one of my girlfriend's friends.

941
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,000
We walked in, so I went,
"So, where's the bride?"

942
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,520
"I haven't met her.
It's an arranged marriage."

943
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,880
I went, "That's weird...
Not weird. Didn't mean to say weird.

944
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,320
This is a day where we must
celebrate our cultural differences.

945
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:31,040
Plus, it's ammunition
for the best man's speech."

946
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:33,720
"There is no best man's speech
at a Muslim wedding."

947
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,320
"Again, that does seem quite unusual
but this is a day of love and tolerance.

948
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,360
Where's the bar?"

949
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,640
"There is no bar. It's a dry wedding."

950
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,560
"Get in the fucking car."

951
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,920
It was a wedding without alcohol.

952
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,800
Let me just repeat that.

953
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,720
It was a wedding without alcohol.

954
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,520
You cannot have a wedding without alcohol.

955
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,320
That is like having a funeral
without a corpse.

956
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,120
You cannot have it.

957
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,440
That's what you do at a wedding.
That's what you do.

958
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:23,200
You drink. You drink afterwards.
You drink during if that is an option.

959
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,360
I'm not religious.

960
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,080
If I ever do get married,
100% I'm having holy communion.

961
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,680
Cheeky pick-me-up
half way through the service? Hell, yeah!

962
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,760
I'm gonna get the priest to drop a little
shot of Jägermeister into the chalice.

963
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,560
Jesus-bombs all round.

964
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:43,640
I want to make one thing
very clear as well.

965
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,920
I don't wish to be disparaging
about the Muslim wedding ceremony.

966
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,280
The fact that the Muslim ceremony is
about more than getting drunk

967
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,320
in a field with a load of strangers:

968
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,360
they definitely got that right.

969
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,960
And the fact that I could not cope
at one sober, is purely a reflection

970
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:01,000
of how sad and pathetic a little man I am.

971
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,280
But I couldn't.

972
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:06,720
I couldn't cope being around
so many strangers without a drink.

973
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,160
I was grabbing my girlfriend
every five minutes.

974
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,080
"Hey, maybe we could get some drugs."

975
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,480
"We're not getting drugs.
This is a wedding."

976
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,280
I'm on my phone, slyly googling:

977
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,560
"Which drugs are halal?"

978
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,720
None of them. None of them.

979
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,280
Then I checked myself.
I'm, like, "Why am I doing this?"

980
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,000
This is what I do: if I'm in an
uncomfortable social situation, I regress.

981
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,760
I become the man-child again.

982
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,280
I don't want to do that.

983
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,440
I want to be that guy that can present
a better version of himself

984
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,800
in public with his missus.

985
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,040
So, I was, like, "For once in my life,
I'm just gonna behave."

986
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,240
My girlfriend, she's with her friends,
talking about some book they've all read.

987
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,840
And I'm over here, just very politely
drifting off into a coma.

988
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:59,000
No one knows.
I sleep with my eyes open.

989
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:04,960
All of a sudden, this little
13-year-old kid, OK, comes up to me,

990
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,240
like a serpent in the garden of Eden.

991
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:09,160
This kid walks up to me, right.

992
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:11,960
Prods me in the ribs and he goes,
"Jack...

993
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,480
would you rather..."

994
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:17,720
Oh, my God, didn't I nearly just cry!

995
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,320
Who remembers playing<span style="style.default_1"> Would You Rather</span>
in the school playground?

996
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:27,280
The greatest form of mental combat
known to man.

997
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:30,120
I looked at this kid
with joy and life in my eyes.

998
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,120
I was, like, "Little man,
I hope you've brought your A-game,

999
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,000
because you have just stepped
into the dojo with the master."

1000
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,000
A look over my left shoulder
would have informed me

1001
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,040
that the book club were very much aware

1002
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,320
that I'd drifted off
from their conversation

1003
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,760
to play a game of<span style="style.default_1"> Would You Rather</span>
with a 13-year-old child.

1004
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,880
But did I care? Did I fuck.

1005
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,720
I rolled the dice.

1006
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,000
I was, like, "Hit me, little man. Hit me."

1007
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,960
He looks up at me. He's, like,
"Jack, would you rather...

1008
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,160
suck chocolate off a tramp's dick..."

1009
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,320
Oh!

1010
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,600
Nice start, my friend.

1011
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,040
Nice start.

1012
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:14,040
My head, now,
a swirling vortex of counter questions.

1013
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,720
I'm thinking,
is this milk chocolate or dark?

1014
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,040
Is this penis flaccid or hard?

1015
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,640
I'm thinking, I really like chocolate,

1016
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,280
but I sure as hell am not a fan
of dirty old tramp dick.

1017
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,000
I look to my girlfriend,
for moral support if anything else.

1018
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,560
Oh, dear. Woop-woop.

1019
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,000
The fun police have
surrounded the building.

1020
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:38,680
And they want me to come out
with my hands held high.

1021
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,960
But I can't do that for two reasons.

1022
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:45,680
I do not know when the next opportunity
to play<span style="style.default_1"> Would You Rather</span> may be.

1023
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,880
And, two, more importantly,
I cannot carry around the burden

1024
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:54,680
of not knowing what the alternative is
to sucking chocolate off a tramp's dick.

1025
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,160
So, for the second time that evening,
I rolled the dice.

1026
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,480
I was like, "You made an excellent start,
but you and I both know,

1027
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,480
this game lives or dies
by the quality of the next option

1028
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,200
that you lay before me."

1029
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,040
Yeah. By this point,
the kid was quite scared of me.

1030
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,000
"Tread very carefully, my friend.
Tread very carefully."

1031
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,360
At this point, though, it was like
the pupil became the master.

1032
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,080
This kid looked up at me unwaveringly

1033
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,160
and do you know what he said?

1034
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,200
He went, "Jack,

1035
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:31,400
would you rather suck chocolate
off a tramp's dick...

1036
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:33,560
or...

1037
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:39,120
have a tramp suck chocolate...

1038
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,360
off your dick?"

1039
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,360
Boom! Mind grenade.

1040
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,320
My face contorted in joy and wonder.

1041
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,600
Like the first time I'd seen "boobies"
displayed on a calculator.

1042
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:52,560
I was, like, "What the fuck?"

1043
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,240
At this point though, our game
is brought to an abrupt end

1044
01:02:56,440 --> 01:03:00,240
as I'm physically manhandled to the corner
of the marquee by my girlfriend

1045
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,760
and told, in no uncertain terms,
that as a responsible adult,

1046
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,520
I should have shut him down,

1047
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,240
rather than ask the boy

1048
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,920
if the tramp had teeth.

1049
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,680
You would! You would.

1050
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:16,920
I've made undignified exits in my time,

1051
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,960
but nothing compares to getting dragged,
screaming, from a Muslim wedding

1052
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:23,200
as you shout back to a 13-year-old kid:

1053
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,560
"I'd suck the dick."

1054
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:33,360
<span style="style.default_1"> Once upon a time,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">there lived the trolls.</span>

1055
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,800
<span style="style.default_1">And of their clan, there was one</span>
<span style="style.default_1">whom all revered.</span>

1056
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,640
<span style="style.default_1">Yes, admittedly he didn't speak much,</span>

1057
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:43,800
<span style="style.default_1">but when he did,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">he was the wisest of them all.</span>

1058
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,120
Oh, don't you worry.

1059
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,560
I am just as disappointed
in this costume as you are.

1060
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,120
I wanted to look like
one of the trolls from<span style="style.default_1"> Frozen.</span>

1061
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,840
I've ended up looking like the love child
of Shrek and Ron Weasley.

1062
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,880
What's happened with the nose?

1063
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,040
One day they'll take you seriously.

1064
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,760
Why do you keep looking down there?

1065
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,280
Oh, my God.

1066
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,440
Have I got camel toe?

1067
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,520
Stop it!

1068
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,880
Stop looking at my troll toe.

1069
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,120
Stop objectifying me.

1070
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:40,200
It's the end of the show, which means that
there's only one thing left me to say.

1071
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,240
Are you fucking joking?

1072
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,440
Can you not move it to me?

1073
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:50,600
Do you know how hard it is
to walk in this?

1074
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,160
Big moment.

1075
