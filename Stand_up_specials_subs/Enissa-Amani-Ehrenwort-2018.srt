00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,840
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL COMEDY SPECIAL

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,074
www.fmsubs.com

3
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,800
Hey, what's up?

4
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,160
What's up?
You're all standing, that's so sweet!

5
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Camera,

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,160
did you get a shot of them standing?
They're standing!

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,600
Thank you. But sit down, sit down!

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,720
Sit down, sit down.

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,120
Alaikum salaam.

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,920
Hamburg, I'm so proud,
you can't even imagine.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Of course I'm extremely nervous,
but I'm just so proud.

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,560
I chose Hamburg for this special,
this beautiful...

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,600
Isn't this a beautiful theater?

14
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,040
We have really beautiful theaters
in Germany.

15
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,200
So classy with the chandelier...
in this street full of brothels.

16
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,040
That's very...

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,360
Seriously. That's kind of my life.

18
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,760
An elegant street surrounded by brothels.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,200
No, I like it. I'm proud to be here.
I have...

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,360
No, it was a little difficult.
We had to pay protection money

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,080
to some random guys.
We wanted to play in this theater,

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,000
and these guys were like, "Yeah... why?"

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,600
We were like, "It's for Netflix."
They were like, "Who's that?"

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Allah, I don't even know.

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,960
I'm so happy, I'm so... Hey, I'm...

26
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,360
That's probably already been mentioned.
I'm very, very proud.

27
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920
I'm the first woman in Germany,

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
and the third person in general...
After two gentlemen,

29
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,920
I'm the first woman
with a Netflix Original in Germany.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,720
I'm so proud... Thank you!

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,640
Hey, listen!

32
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,480
Hey, wait. Hang on.

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,440
That doesn't count. Stop the shenanigans.
You either clap right away, sincerely...

34
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,240
But not after a second's hesitation,
like...

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,120
A lot of people don't know what that is.
A Netflix Original is... Also these...

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,880
Hang on.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,760
Original means there is this, you know,
Netflix logo at the beginning.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,320
That means people
who are watching this saw it, too.

39
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,120
The Netflix logo comes first,
and then there's this "duh-dun."

40
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,760
That's it, really.
That's the whole difference, you know?

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,800
Really, there's this "duh-dun."

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,400
Netflix reached out to me.
At first I was like, "No, I don't know...

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,040
I'm, like, artsy and stuff.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,360
Really, I don't want anything
to do with TV.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,840
I only want to do live shows,
art and stuff."

46
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,560
Then Netflix made an offer,
and all I heard was "duh-dun," Allah.

47
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,800
I was like, "Okay, I'm on my way.

48
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,720
Hang on."

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,400
But this is Germany, you know?

50
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,960
If you think, "Damn, Enissa is rich now,"
think again.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,440
Right away, the taxman was like,
"Duh-dun!"

52
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,280
I swear. I haven't paid yet.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,800
The day after tomorrow, the debt collector
will be like, "Duh-dun!"

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,240
Freelancers...
Do we have any freelancers here tonight?

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
You know how that is. Since I've...

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,640
Do you try to deduct everything, too?

57
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Everything. I try to deduct everything.

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,760
I even try to deduct thoughts.

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,880
I called the taxman, I was like,
"I had a thought."

60
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,320
I want to handle that correctly,
I believe in the system.

61
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,080
You know? I want to...
I do little extra things.

62
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,200
Like I'm trying to get sick
so I can go to the doctor.

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
Then I can deduct that.

64
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm really very proud, I mean...
Forget Netflix, I mean in general.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,560
No, I love them, I swear.

66
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,400
More than anything.
They're paying so much! So...

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,520
I love them.
Do you all watch Stranger Things?

68
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,840
Please watch it.
What are you watching right now?

69
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,360
Watch everything! Watch Stranger Things
and this Dark...

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,760
That new show. Dark...

71
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,080
It's a German Netflix Original, the first.
Watch that.

72
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,040
The Netflix people are here tonight, too.

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,880
They're sitting somewhere,
Illuminati-style... like, "Okay..."

74
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,360
What else is there to watch?
Is there porn on Netflix?

75
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,040
Is there news on Netflix?

76
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,240
News would be cool.
I'd watch a whole season in advance.

77
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,640
That'd be a spoiler.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,320
In Germany, you have to be careful.
We are not that relaxed.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,960
I'm so proud, I've been performing
in English for a year now.

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,400
I'm extremely proud.
It's intense to perform abroad.

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,520
But it's also a little different,
you know?

82
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,280
In Germany,
people know me, they get excited.

83
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,200
People ask me in the street
to have their picture taken with me.

84
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,160
Bless you.

85
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,000
They ask... Seriously, someone was like...

86
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,400
It's really cool.
People know me by now, I'm very proud.

87
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,560
People are so kind,
they approach me in the street.

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,720
"Hey, I like what you do,
I like your work," and so on.

89
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,240
But then you go abroad,
and you are just... nobody.

90
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,280
Just... You're abroad,
so of course you start over.

91
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm nobody. I'm a total loser.
I'm like this guy. You know?

92
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
I'm just... Seriously!

93
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,360
Abroad, I'm just like him.

94
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
He is... Sorry.

95
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,680
Him.

96
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,360
Just kidding. He is really cute. He is...

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,240
You're sitting front row.
Front row is always fucked, you know?

98
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
Front row, man... Who has never been
to a comedy show before?

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Never? Ever? You've been to one before?

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,080
And you make the same mistake again.
Front row, dear?

101
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,720
Just kidding. What's your name? Yannis.
I'm such a Yannis when I'm abroad.

102
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,320
A proper...
Abroad, seriously, I'm just Yannis.

103
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,600
I'm him.

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Give it up for Yannis, please.
He did so well.

105
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,400
Yannis has...

106
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,680
I want to tell you something
about being abroad.

107
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,440
Germans complain that American or
British stand-up comedians are the best.

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,520
Right?

109
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
Our idols are mostly American
or British comedians. That's true.

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,240
Those from the UK, from London,
are phenomenal, true.

111
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,360
But listen, guys, seriously,
the audience is different, too.

112
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,880
The audience... It's a reciprocal thing.

113
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,080
We have to deliver,
you have to enjoy yourselves.

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,760
Here in Germany,
we're all a little reserved.

115
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,160
You know?
Abroad, I perform with a mixed lineup,

116
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,560
with different colleagues.

117
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,560
In the audience there are people...
Absolutely nobody knows who I am,

118
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,720
they don't know whether I'm good or funny,
or what I look like. Nothing.

119
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,120
And then you get announced,
and before they even see you,

120
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,200
the Americans go nuts.
You know what they're like.

121
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,600
They stand up and yell,
applaud and stuff...

122
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,840
In Germany, it's...

123
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,240
Hang on.

124
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,160
In Germany, there are people

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,880
who buy their tickets
seven months in advance.

126
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,320
Seven months in advance.

127
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,280
They're so excited to see the show,

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,560
they might even honor you by saying
they're a fan or something. Right?

129
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Then you come out on stage,

130
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,520
and they are sitting there like that.

131
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,480
Really. Like that!
I just busted some people. Yeah!

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
I swear. They have this mindset,

133
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,240
this inner mindset,
they are like, "Well, it might be nice."

134
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
It's confusing for us here on stage.
I mean, I can see you.

135
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,160
I don't know if he's fine or miserable,
if he's a Nazi... I don't know!

136
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,680
I don't know what...

137
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,320
But I love...

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,800
We have to...

139
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,040
The ease...
That's what's missing a little. The ease.

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,440
We've got people like...
Up here is Yannis, for example.

141
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,880
Then we have...

142
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,080
Yannis, where are you from? Originally?
Are you German?

143
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,400
Where are my Germans at?
Wait, no.

144
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,680
Guys...

145
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,560
She's only yelling...
Normally, Germans would never yell.

146
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,680
You just... All other nationalities yell.

147
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,680
No matter whom you ask. Poles, Russians,
Iranians, Turks, everyone.

148
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,800
And Germans... Even though
they are a majority, even in my audience.

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,520
When I ask, "Where are the Germans?"
They're like, "Mm-hm, yes...

150
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,000
We are present, yes.

151
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,280
I have also purchased a ticket.
Tim, raise your hand, too!"

152
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,840
Germans...
Germans love their understatement.

153
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,280
See, us migrants...
Even if it's just one person, you know?

154
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
I ask, "Where are the Turkish people?"

155
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,280
Why this unnecessary pride? Why?

156
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,680
It's... Same thing with Iranians,
even if it's only one person.

157
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,840
Where are the Iranians?

158
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,800
Why?

159
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,440
I always think they do the same thing
at the UN, like when they have a vote.

160
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,320
Everyone is against it,
and the Iranians go...

161
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,360
"Not us, we are all for it.
As a matter of principle."

162
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,000
I thank the Turks for coming,
and the Iranians. Where are the Kurds?

163
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
Very nice.

164
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,240
Did you see that?

165
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,880
And he did right by sitting very far
from the Turks. Well done.

166
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160
Honey, stay there for safety reasons.

167
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,800
Do we have more Turks, Kurds, who are...?
Who are sitting together?

168
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,680
Turks and Kurds? Wow!
Is the press here tonight?

169
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,480
Please write, "Enissa Amani
is bringing peace to the world."

170
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,920
Please write that. It's so good.

171
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,680
Really? Turks and...

172
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,360
Turks, Kurds. I'm proud.
That makes me really proud.

173
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,520
Let me tell you,
here in this beautiful theater...

174
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,400
Wherever I've performed, I'm not kidding,

175
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,240
no matter how big the location was,
even in an arena,

176
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,840
no matter how many people were there,
if you ask, "Are there any Turks here?"

177
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,360
one side screams.

178
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,680
If you ask for Kurds,
the other side screams.

179
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,520
I always ask myself,
how do they separate... How? 6000 guests.

180
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Is there anyone at the entrance
who's like,

181
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,800
"Good evening. You are Turkish?
Please sit on the right.

182
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,800
You are Kurdish? Please sit on the left."

183
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,280
How do they do that?

184
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,640
I love this world-peace stuff.
We actually do have the press here.

185
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,600
The newspaper Bild accredited themselves.
Jerks, all of them. Yeah.

186
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,640
Really, that's how they get in touch.

187
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,160
Bild writes an e-mail to the agency, like,

188
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,800
"We would like to accredit ourselves
for this evening."

189
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,680
What they're saying is, they want to come.
You know?

190
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,960
Why do they even use words like that
when their readers don't even get them?

191
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Why "accredit"?

192
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,640
Those sons of bitches.

193
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,280
It's true, you shouldn't fuck with them.
I love the Bild newspaper.

194
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,040
To be honest, they treat me very nicely.

195
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,640
I talk shit about them,
they write nice stuff about me.

196
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,120
No idea why. They are really...

197
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
No, please, subscribe to Bild.
They're great. Please do.

198
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,280
Seriously, they have a lot of power.

199
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,000
Check it out. There is always
a whore on the first page. Check it out.

200
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
-Who is this guy in the front?
-Fatih.

201
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,240
-Fatih? Where's this name from?
-Turkey.

202
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,160
From Turkey. Fatih here...
I'll give you a good example.

203
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,560
You know? Listen.

204
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,920
One, two, three...

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
In the fourth row, there is a classy lady
with a groomed haircut and a scarf.

206
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,800
She is from the intellectual camp,
you know? You can see it.

207
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,600
This lady has already seen
a theater from the inside, you know?

208
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,200
It's not her first time
in the St. Pauli theater.

209
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,520
What's your name, my dear?

210
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,160
-Monika.
-Monika. All right. Listen.

211
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,200
See, I'm very proud
of this mixed audience,

212
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,040
but it makes it very hard for me
to write stand-up.

213
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,000
Because I have to write a set
that Monika likes...

214
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,600
but which also amuses Fatih.

215
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
That is a little bit...

216
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,000
It's not easy.
With a mixed audience, it's not easy.

217
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,200
But it's cool.
Normally, if the show is going well,

218
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,480
Monika will meet Fatih by accident
in St. Pauli tomorrow,

219
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,600
and then Monika will say to Fatih,
"Hey, bro, what's up?"

220
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,240
You know? It's like...

221
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,640
It's important to me that you're relaxed.
You're here to have fun, aren't you?

222
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,280
Doing stand-up, I've realized,
is the coolest job ever,

223
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,400
because I really believe in karma,

224
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,960
and for one evening
it's my job to make people laugh.

225
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,120
The thing is, this has been proven,
the live audience in Germany...

226
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,640
Every other person attending
a live comedy show

227
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,080
is someone who is having a hard time.

228
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,080
Look, someone's nodding already.
Seriously, the girl in the fifth row...

229
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,800
"I was about to kill myself, but I thought
I want to see Enissa one last time."

230
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,000
I've already done one side.

231
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,640
No, really. I do it myself.
If I feel bad, I go watch a comedy show.

232
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,080
And I don't mean stupid everyday worries
that we all have,

233
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,320
like financial problems.

234
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,680
I don't have those anymore,
I'm doing really well.

235
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,400
No, I mean it.
We all have our everyday problems,

236
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,640
I'm not talking about those.
I mean people who are having a hard time

237
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,520
because of a sickness,
accident, disability.

238
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
We often have...
And I'm really proud of that.

239
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,440
We have people here who come
to the signing session afterwards

240
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,520
and say,
"Hey, comedy means a lot to me.

241
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
It gives me strength, makes me laugh."

242
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
I'm so proud of my job because...

243
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,960
I get to make people happy
for one evening.

244
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,960
They should laugh
and forget their worries.

245
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,560
But you need to be relaxed for that.
There's no need to overthink things.

246
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,120
Listen, I ask people
about their nationalities.

247
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,320
In the beginning, I ask
if there are Germans, Russians, Poles...

248
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,880
I ask around. And at night,
one person posts on my Facebook page:

249
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,520
"Yeah, but you didn't ask
about Macedonians."

250
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,080
Because nobody cares, dumbass.

251
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,040
I should ask about Macedo... What is this?

252
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,600
I'm just kidding.

253
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,280
I love Macedonians.

254
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,640
Are there any Macedonians here?

255
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,480
There really is one!

256
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,760
I love Macedonians, really.

257
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,880
She is really pretty, she doesn't even
look like a whore. Welcome!

258
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,320
Wow, Hamburg, Allah...

259
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,960
I swear, honey...

260
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:33,920
I really do, sweetie.
Did the camera get the pretty girl?

261
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,840
I just wanted to check
how horrible they are.

262
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,640
I love Mace... In my opinion,
Macedonians are the smartest,

263
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,760
most intellectual, beautiful,
amazing women and men on the planet.

264
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,720
Just great. They are never whores.
Czechs are whores.

265
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,000
Macedonians...

266
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,400
Seriously. Are there any Czechs here?

267
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,480
Really? I swear, I love Czechs.

268
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,680
Honestly, I love Czechs.
They are the best.

269
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
They are the smartest, greatest...

270
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,880
Relax, people.
Listen, sometimes I perform...

271
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,760
I'll give you two examples
on how to be relaxed.

272
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,840
Sometimes I'm invited to do a cabaret.
I'm very proud of it.

273
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,200
And when I'm invited to do a cabaret,
there are older, renowned colleagues,

274
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
whom I'm a huge fan of myself.

275
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,720
It's a great honor
to share a stage with them.

276
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,680
But of course, it's a different audience.
You go out on stage,

277
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,880
the audience isn't as diverse as mine.

278
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,680
Yannis is here,
Fatih is here, Monika is here.

279
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,200
No, you get on stage, the entire audience
is 80 years or older.

280
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,640
Everyone, seriously. So much white hair

281
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,760
you think you're standing
in a field of cotton. Really.

282
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,240
I would... Yeah.

283
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,440
And then...

284
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
It's good...

285
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,880
But still, I'm proud to perform there.

286
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,600
But a different generation
means a different use of language,

287
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,080
a different jargon.

288
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,760
They don't get everything.
If you, you know...

289
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,920
If you come from a different generation,
you speak a little differently.

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,880
But it's good. I perform in a cabaret,
they're laughing, I'm proud.

291
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,480
I think, "Cool, this is going down well."
I tell them about my childhood...

292
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
But I've also had cabaret shows

293
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,840
when I suddenly said
something like "son of a bitch,"

294
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,880
and the whole audience was startled.

295
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,840
The whole... You could sense it,
they were all, like, frozen, you know?

296
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,160
And you think,
"Oh, no, what happened? Did they die?"

297
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
You can't know for sure, can you?

298
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,200
It's my job to entertain them, right?

299
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,120
I had a cabaret show close to Münster,

300
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,640
and I... Everyone was laughing.
I was talking about my childhood,

301
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,440
and at some point I said "son of a bitch,"
and everyone was shocked.

302
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,440
I thought, "Oh, no, I have to explain it."
So I told them,

303
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,240
first of all, I'd never say
such a thing in private.

304
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,760
Never. Yeah, okay, if I say Nazis
are sons of bitches, well...

305
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,560
Or ISIS, okay.

306
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,520
But I'd never say it to a person, really.
Never.

307
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,840
If there are younger people are here,
I've done my bit for their upbringing.

308
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,880
I would never... I wouldn't do that.
That's just not done.

309
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,600
But on stage, well, that's different.

310
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,320
I tried to explain it, but it was in vain.

311
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,920
There was an elderly gentleman
in the first row. Very elegant, groomed.

312
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,120
He was a lot older. He wore a suit jacket
and was listening intently.

313
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I thought, I'm gonna talk to him,
that's how I'll save the situation.

314
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,280
I wanted him to understand
that it was just fun.

315
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,520
So I asked him, I went, "Excuse me,

316
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,120
how did you insult your peers
in your youth?

317
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,640
When you were young,
what was the ultimate expletive?

318
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,560
When you were a teenager,
what was the worst thing you said

319
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,360
when you got really, really angry?"

320
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,440
And he said... He tilted his head back
and looked at me sternly.

321
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,400
He said, "When I was young, Miss Amani...

322
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,440
we were not cussing at all."

323
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,800
I said, "Well, you weren't allowed to
in the Hitler Youth."

324
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,440
I'm glad you're laughing.
They didn't laugh at all.

325
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,360
Wait, hang on, speaking of examples
of how to be relaxed...

326
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Before anybody can say,
"Oh, she called the old guy a Nazi!"

327
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,760
No, I didn't. Well, yes, I did, but...

328
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
I swear to you, this guy was so cool.

329
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,160
He was so relaxed and had
such a great understanding of comedy.

330
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,480
He understood right off that I was joking.
How would I know whether he was a Nazi?

331
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,640
He probably was, but I wouldn't know.
I can't...

332
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,680
No, he was really... After that,
he really loosened up, laughed along,

333
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,520
and understood that it's my job
to be quick-witted, that it's not...

334
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,880
And then he really got involved.
My next bit was something about

335
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,040
bitches from Berlin.

336
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,120
So I asked the same gentleman,
"Sorry, do you know the word 'bitch'?"

337
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,960
And he said,
"No, but I know where Berlin is."

338
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,040
He was... Like I said, such a cool guy.
He even gave me a fist bump.

339
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,280
And I thought, it's so cool he had
such an understanding for comedy.

340
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,640
Much more than most 18-year-olds.
That he just grasped...

341
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,760
I went backstage very proudly,
and I gave that gentleman some tickets.

342
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,120
I was at a cabaret show
with four older colleagues,

343
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,640
we each had 15-minute sets.

344
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,560
And I said to that gentleman,
"You know what?

345
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,600
When I'm in the city with my solo show,
my live show,

346
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,400
I'd like to give you tickets.
Bring your wife, be my guests."

347
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,560
He's still one of my biggest fans,
comes to a lot of shows.

348
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,840
So I'm going backstage,
and I want to tell my colleagues

349
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,200
about the guy in the front row.

350
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,200
I'm so proud,
I want to tell them how cool he was...

351
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
And again, my generation's slang,

352
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,800
I said, "Did you see that bastard
in the front row?"

353
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,640
And my colleague was like,
"Yeah, that was my father."

354
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,200
After that...

355
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
After that, cabaret was like "ciao."

356
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,320
Monika, "cabaret ciao" means...

357
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,240
Kids nowadays use the word "ciao"
for something that is over, you know?

358
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,600
They say, like, "Blah, blah, ciao."

359
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,920
For instance...

360
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,240
You are Yannis' girlfriend, right, hun?

361
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,440
Oh, wife even?

362
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,560
So if in two years' time...

363
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,640
you don't want him anymore, you say,
"Yannis, ciao."

364
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,280
Did you get that, Monika? Yeah.

365
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,640
Kids create a lot of new words nowadays.
I can't even keep up.

366
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,720
A new use of language has developed

367
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,880
in the urban area, in pop culture.

368
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,480
They don't use articles anymore.

369
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,840
They say stuff like,
"Listen, I'm going shop."

370
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,480
This doesn't mean they don't know
how it's supposed to be.

371
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,600
It's just cool not to use them anymore.

372
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,160
There's no need to correct them and say,

373
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,320
"Sorry, it's 'to the shop.'"
They do it on purpose.

374
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,280
Seriously, I have a younger cousin,
he is about 18.

375
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:38,400
When he speaks, you'd think
he had one single brain cell.

376
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,520
But he is really smart, I mean it.

377
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,080
He's studying economics,

378
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,440
he's tutoring students,
getting the best grades.

379
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,280
But when he talks to me,
he uses new expressions all the time.

380
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Just recently...
Sometimes I like to ask him about music,

381
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
about what kids are listening to nowadays,

382
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,200
about rappers... I ask him, "Hey..."
His name is Taymas.

383
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,240
I go, "Taymas, can you tell me what's
so great about this Kendrick Lamar?"

384
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,960
Monika, Kendrick Lamar...

385
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,600
Let Fatih explain it to you
after the show.

386
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,120
He is...

387
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,720
Anyway, doesn't matter.
He's some rapper who is hyped in the US.

388
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,840
So I'm asking my cousin,
"Why is Kendrick Lamar so famous?

389
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,400
What is so different about him?
Why is he better than other rappers?

390
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,680
Explain it to me." And he says to me,

391
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,400
"Enissa, he's just a Pisko, dude."

392
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I go, "Excuse me, what is he?"

393
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,880
He says, "He's a Pisko!"
I go, "What is a Pisko? What...

394
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,000
Is it something good or bad?
Is he sick? What is it?"

395
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,800
And he says, "No, man, he's a Pisko,
like a psycho, like extreme!"

396
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,320
I go, "What? Is he good extreme
or bad extreme?

397
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,320
Should we collect donations or..."

398
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,160
Seriously, how would I know?
The way young people talk today...

399
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,240
"He's a Pisko, Enissa."

400
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,400
Then I go, "Come on, Taymas, please.
Just explain it to me. I'd like to know,

401
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,120
because everyone says... Explain it."
He goes, "I can't, he's a Pisko!"

402
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,120
Then I get upset, I say, "Taymas, listen,

403
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,960
there are authors...
Hemingway for instance.

404
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,320
He was known for describing things
with such detail and so beautifully

405
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,480
that even without ever having seen
or heard of it,

406
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,640
you could somehow visualize it.

407
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,880
I don't know, the taste of a fruit,
for instance. Beautifully described.

408
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,280
Something like,
'a pear is sandy on your tongue,'

409
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,240
or something similar.
Explain it to me like that."

410
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,120
He's like, "I can't, I'm not Hemingway."
I go, "I'm aware of that, but...

411
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,760
But it would be nice if you tried."

412
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,160
So he started to... And this is the truth.
I didn't write this, it really happened.

413
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,680
My cousin said to me, "Enissa, listen.

414
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,920
Lyrically, he is on a level
like no rapper ever before him,

415
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,920
and at the same time he manages
to convey socio-critical topics

416
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,320
in his raps, while also being
completely self-reflective, and..."

417
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,160
I swear, he performed a monologue.
I was...

418
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,000
Seriously, I was so flabbergasted
that he could express himself like that.

419
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,920
I stood before him, I was like,
"Oh, why didn't you say so? He's a Pisko!

420
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,280
He is..." I didn't even know.

421
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,360
You just don't know.

422
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,200
Another thing the youths use nowadays...
Fatih, too, I'm sure of it.

423
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,640
They always say... When they admire
someone, like a person, a personality,

424
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,360
they say, "He is an 'honor man.'"

425
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,840
Do you know this, Fatih?
It's all over my Instagram account.

426
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,360
I'm quoting some statement from Goethe,
and someone writes,

427
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,360
"Goethe was an honor man."

428
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,840
Really. Check my Instagram, I'm not lying.

429
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,120
I posted a video of Pocahontas,

430
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,280
a Disney movie, and someone commented,
"Pocahontas was an honor woman."

431
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,960
What is this "honor man"?
I don't even know...

432
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,600
They describe everything with it.
"He was an honor man."

433
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,960
I arrived in Hamburg today,
we stood at the beautiful river, Alster.

434
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
I went, "Damn, a total honor river."

435
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,720
This theater is a total honor theater.

436
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,880
I think it sucks that guys
are not fighting over girls anymore.

437
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,400
Right? Be honest.

438
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,600
I know, the new political correctness
and stuff, but sometimes I miss that.

439
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,560
Right? When was the last time...?
Honey, when was the last...?

440
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Has Yannis ever fought with someone
over you?

441
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,640
Never, am I right?
You'd think he is a total pussy.

442
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,800
You'd think...

443
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,800
You'd think he is politically correct,
but...

444
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,160
Listen, he is well-built.
Yannis is really well-built.

445
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,760
Fatih, you don't even
have to look at him like that.

446
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,800
Follow his example.
He's eating gluten-free stuff.

447
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Just fight over a woman! That's nice.

448
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,080
The first and last time
guys were fighting over me

449
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,240
was in fourth grade.

450
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,720
It was in fourth grade, I swear.
Welcome to the show.

451
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,240
It was... I had...

452
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,600
It was in fourth grade.
Two guys, Daniel and Francisco.

453
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,800
It was total nonsense. We were just kids,
it wasn't even...

454
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,200
They said, "We are fighting over Enissa."

455
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,680
I was so happy. I walked around
the whole school and told everyone,

456
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,120
"Daniel and Francisco
are fighting over me...

457
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
after sixth period, in the park."

458
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,520
I told everyone.

459
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,240
"Daniel and Francisco are fighting over me.
Oh, no, I don't want them to..."

460
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,720
So I gathered the whole school
in the park after sixth period.

461
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,920
You know what they did?
They were there, standing face to face,

462
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,440
and then they made up.

463
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Seriously, one of them said, "Whatever...

464
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,360
I'm in love with Julia anyway."

465
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,160
It's the same thing today.
Guys have become so politically correct.

466
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,800
They would say,
"No, brother, you love her more.

467
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,720
I want Julia anyway."

468
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,600
Are there any gays here tonight?
I have a big gay fan community.

469
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,840
Of course, yes. What's your name, honey?

470
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,800
-Michael.
-Mi... What?

471
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,360
-Gian.
-Gian. That's a very gay name.

472
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,720
Welcome to the show, Gian.

473
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,560
Gian is here. I'm so happy!

474
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,200
It's nice, I have gay fans.

475
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,760
Anyone else? Anyone else gay? Only Gian?

476
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,240
-What?
-In the back.

477
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,040
In the back, of course. In the...

478
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
I swear... Guys...

479
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,320
Hey! This is supposed to be a PG evening.

480
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,280
Calm down, Hamburg.

481
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,480
No one is going to believe me
that this really happened.

482
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:35,080
Hamburg, you're my witnesses.
This really happened.

483
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,920
I swear, he is a total honor gay.

484
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,600
-What's the gay in the back called?
-Michael.

485
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Michael. Come sit with Gian.

486
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,640
Michael and Gian. I'm very happy
about my gay fans. They're very...

487
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,320
Do I have les...? I always have...
Where are the lesbian fans?

488
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,280
Really? Wow! So many! Not bad.

489
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,560
Here, over there.
I'm very proud of the lesbians, too.

490
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,160
Up front, two lesbians, third row.

491
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,680
What's your name? It's an outing.

492
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,240
You know this special
will be shown internationally, yes?

493
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,840
So if your grandmother in Gummersbach...

494
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,240
didn't know, well, she knows now.

495
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,040
What are your names? May I out you
internationally? Is that okay?

496
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,840
What's your name? No, I'm not...
Am I cross-eyed, dude?

497
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,920
There are so many lesbians here.
Second row is answering, third row...

498
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,040
Yannis is thinking, "Not bad," because...
I'm...

499
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,640
Yannis is... Fatih is thinking...

500
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,600
Fatih...

501
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,520
Fatih looked over there, too.
He's like, "Just you wait.

502
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,120
One night with me
and she won't be a lesbian anymore."

503
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,560
Fatih... No. Fatih has a very pretty woman
beside him. She's very cute.

504
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,600
Are you together?

505
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,280
Weird, because she is really pretty,
and he's, like, okay.

506
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,560
No, he is good-looking, too.
Like I said, the front row is screwed.

507
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
So, what are these two lesbians called?

508
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,640
-Come again?
-Sunny.

509
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,040
-Sunny?
-That's right.

510
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,680
-Naddl.
-Naddl?

511
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,560
Sunny and Naddl.
Yes, those are very strong lesbian names.

512
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,760
Sunny and Naddl. I'm happy, I'm so proud.

513
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,560
A very cool community supporting me here.

514
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,400
I like it when...

515
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,040
I really like it when...
I get asked this a lot, I don't know why.

516
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,760
If you're a woman in the public eye,
people ask you, for instance,

517
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,680
"What's important to you
in a relationship?"

518
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,840
I was raised by a feminist woman.
A lot of people known that... Know that.

519
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,480
"Known that."
So much for correct language.

520
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,440
A lot of people known
that an honor woman raised me.

521
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,320
A feminist, my mother.

522
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,840
Since I was raised that way,
women's rights are very important to me.

523
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,640
But listen, I like it when a guy
is slightly dominant. Slightly.

524
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,560
If he says stuff like, "If you do that..."

525
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,680
"...you'll be whipped?"

526
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,480
Yeah, it has to be subtle,
that's important.

527
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,480
It shouldn't be, like...
For example, "I'll break your legs."

528
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,920
That's good, right?

529
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,240
It could be even more subtle.
He calls you up, he's like,

530
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,320
"Go get life insurance."

531
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,240
Seriously. "Go Allianz.

532
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,120
Get life insurance."

533
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
I like that.

534
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,000
We are still in the intro.
I haven't even started the set yet.

535
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,440
This is supposed to be
a 60-minute special.

536
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,480
That's really...

537
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,800
In case you didn't get it, what I wanted
to tell you with all this...

538
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,760
is that right now,
there is a special offer at Rewe...

539
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,040
If you buy two large bottles
of Head & Shoulders shampoo,

540
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,280
you get a small one for free.

541
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,360
What's going on with Rewe, dude?

542
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,280
I don't know
if I'm even allowed to say that.

543
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,560
I love them.
I go shopping there, all right?

544
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,960
I stand there in the line,
reading my Bild newspaper. But...

545
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,480
There's a new Rewe store
opening up every ten feet.

546
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,960
As I was raised by revolutionary parents,
this is still a big part of me.

547
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,880
I have a little revolutionary in me.
I want to change the world.

548
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,160
I want to have more justice, I'm trying...
I do a lot of charity work.

549
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,840
But again, typically German,
you're not supposed to talk about it.

550
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,720
You know? Germans love understatement.

551
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:28,840
You're supposed to do good, but don't...
Why? I want to brag about it. Let me...

552
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,680
I want to write on my Facebook page,
"I did a good deed today."

553
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,800
But it's really like that.
When you travel a little...

554
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,440
I help charity organizations,
and I realize that a lot of people help.

555
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,120
The world has become so small.
It's not just famous people.

556
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,080
Everyone, whether rich or poor,
doesn't matter.

557
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,480
People are helping,
but nevertheless, unfortunately,

558
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:53,280
every eight minutes, a child dies
because of a lack of water supply.

559
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,280
It's bullshit!

560
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,880
And on this side of the Earth,
a Rewe opens up every ten feet.

561
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,920
Every ten feet!
You walk along, boom, another Rewe.

562
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,200
What's going on here?
How many more...? Boom, Rewe.

563
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,960
When I get back home to Cologne today,
a Rewe will be in my living room.

564
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,320
Somebody will be placing yogurt
on my bookshelves.

565
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,280
What's wrong with them?

566
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,600
But I admit, we're all like this.
Even the best of us.

567
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:22,000
Even people I consider idols
in terms of how dedicated they are,

568
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,440
what they do for this world.

569
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,840
But in the end...
Listen, here's an example.

570
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,320
I'd been driving an ancient, rusty Audi
for a long time.

571
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:35,000
I had it from my student days.
Then everything went so fast.

572
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,880
Four years ago, I'm not kidding,
I was still a law student,

573
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,880
but I only enrolled
because of the student metro ticket.

574
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,160
I was the kind of person who went shopping
and paid with eight different cards.

575
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,840
"Excuse me, could you charge three euros
on this card and two on this one?

576
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:53,160
And I still have 800 reward points,
could you cash them...?" Like that.

577
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,960
"Can I buy a yogurt
with these reward points?"

578
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,400
Anyway...

579
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,920
An honor yogurt.

580
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,360
Anyway... No, but...
That's the kind of person I was.

581
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,920
And then it all happened so fast,
and I'm so happy.

582
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm glad that I can pass this on
to young girls.

583
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,280
I'm so happy because... I wanted to...

584
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,440
There are brilliant female comedians
in Germany,

585
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,680
but there weren't any
whom I could identify with.

586
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,880
Where I could say
that she's my type of woman,

587
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,040
that she's like me in terms of style
and the type of woman I am.

588
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,640
Since I do this, I'm happy to get messages
from young girls who say, "Hey, Enissa,

589
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,760
I want to do the same."
It makes me really proud.

590
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,760
But I noticed that it kind of changed
my view of the world.

591
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,480
These past four years...
I try to stay the same Enissa,

592
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,880
and I'm happy to say that I still am.

593
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,280
People write me,
"It's cool that you've stayed the same.

594
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,920
That you still comment on
and update your site yourself."

595
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,840
That's me. I like answering people. But...

596
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,000
I was driving this ancient, rusty Audi,
and everyone asked,

597
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,200
"Why do you still drive that?
It's got 10,000 miles on it,

598
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,560
dents in the front and in the back."
And I'm like, "No,

599
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,640
that's the last piece of the old me."

600
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,000
But then I also have this other side.

601
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,440
So I got myself the biggest pimp car
that Mercedes had to offer.

602
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,400
Seriously. An AMG GT S. Yeah, man.

603
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,600
Complete with the whole pimp package.

604
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,920
It's got everything. Yeah. Seriously.

605
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,440
I know it's bad for the environment,

606
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,320
but I always rub the outside
with olive oil, right?

607
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,560
It all happened so fast,
in the blink of an eye.

608
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,520
I had three gigs on open stages in cafés.

609
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,480
They have open stages in every major city.
Hamburg, too, it's great.

610
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,400
You just go there and sign up, like,

611
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,080
"Hey, I wrote a text I'd like to perform."

612
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:44,200
I did that in the summer of 2013,
not so long ago. I was still a student.

613
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,400
There were 18 people eating their salads.
Nobody was paying attention.

614
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,640
I think this guy was there on that day,
am I right? What's your name, dear?

615
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,280
-Daniel.
-Daniel. Stalker.

616
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,640
Anyway, Daniel... Shit.
Daniel was there, I'm sure.

617
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,360
Daniel is an honor fan.

618
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,960
Daniel was there.

619
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,200
So I performed there and sent it
to comedy shows that I knew from TV.

620
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,040
I sent it to a bunch of them.

621
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,840
A few actually answered and said,
"Hey, we like your performance.

622
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,680
Do you have more?" I said, "No."

623
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
But they still invited me,
and it went so fast.

624
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,960
Before my first performance on TV,
I created a Facebook page on the fly.

625
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,320
I had no idea how this would work,
being on TV and everything,

626
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,960
millions of people watching me.

627
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,800
My site immediately had 500 followers,
all my cousins from Iran.

628
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,280
So I performed there...

629
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,000
It was taped in the afternoon
and broadcast in the evening.

630
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,400
After the show, I went home,
sat on the couch and watched it myself.

631
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,480
And I was so... After the show,
all of a sudden I had 3000 followers.

632
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,360
That was so surreal for me.
I had 800 messages in my Facebook inbox.

633
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,960
It was so much. I was just so overwhelmed

634
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,600
that I couldn't sleep for two nights,
I was so nervous.

635
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,040
I answered each and every message.

636
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,200
People were writing, for instance,
"Nice performance."

637
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,560
And I sent them back texts this long.

638
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Seriously. I was like, "You know,
I came here with my family from Iran,

639
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,320
then this happened and that happened..."

640
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,120
I wrote so much,
people started to block me, you know?

641
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,240
They were like, "All right, all right!
We just wanted to say it was nice."

642
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,320
I went, "No, why can't we be friends?"

643
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,840
Nowadays...

644
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,040
Nowadays, people think a lot of things...
To be honest, I thought that as well.

645
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,720
From a certain point on,
you imagine that famous people...

646
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,360
You think that they live
very glamorous lives.

647
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,720
I was kind of looking forward to that,
to be honest. I thought...

648
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,840
I thought it would be...
Germans in general...

649
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,360
Listen, I have to clarify this,

650
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,280
because there are always people
going "huh?" right away.

651
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
First of all, I myself am German.

652
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,240
I definitely consider myself German.
I'm German and Iranian, sure.

653
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I love both countries,
they are both close to my heart.

654
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,200
But Germany is clearly my home.

655
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,480
I mean, I've seen Iran three times
for two weeks at a time, you know?

656
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:12,320
Yannis has been to Iran
more often than me.

657
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,160
So it's a little...

658
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,120
But I love Iran.
I'm fluent in both languages.

659
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,400
But the thing is...

660
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:23,240
It's so sweet, when I'm abroad
performing my stand-up in English...

661
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,440
I think it's sweet.
When people ask what I am,

662
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,640
I say, "I'm German."
Immediately, it's a reflex.

663
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,240
I don't say, "I'm from Germany,"
I say, "I'm German."

664
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,400
I found it so cool
that my comedy peers abroad just said,

665
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,520
"The German girl."

666
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,600
When performing at the Laugh Factory
in Hollywood,

667
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,760
I was introduced as "the German girl."
Nobody questioned it.

668
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:41,720
Nobody said,
"She doesn't really look German."

669
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,800
I was just "the German."

670
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,760
And I'm very proud of that, but on stage,

671
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,040
of course I sometimes say things
that are a little problematic

672
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,440
with my Iranian background.
Like when I say "the Germans."

673
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,600
By that I mean, which should be obvious,

674
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,000
my German friends

675
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:02,920
who don't have an immigrant background.

676
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:06,200
They are still out there somewhere,
nobody is perfect.

677
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,720
Wait, stop!

678
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,480
Guys...

679
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,720
That's so sweet. I love it. Thank you.

680
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,920
The Germans applaud self-ironically,
thank you,

681
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
while the immigrants are like,
"Are we allowed to laugh about that?"

682
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,720
"No idea. Let's ask Fatih."

683
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,160
You should be self-ironic.

684
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,720
Anyway, on stage, I often say
words like Kanake. Difficult terms.

685
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,160
I have friends with immigrant backgrounds
who would be totally offended

686
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
if someone called them Kanake,
regardless of who said it.

687
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:40,120
I think it's a term
that has become more common

688
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,640
in urban areas, kind of.

689
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:46,480
It's become part of popular culture.
You can use the term Kanake,

690
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,120
but it's a little bit like the N-word
in the US.

691
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,680
So if you're gonna use it,
you can only do so

692
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,320
if you're part of that particular group.

693
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,240
If I used the N-word in the US,
everyone would freak out.

694
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,040
And rightly so. They'd say,
"What are you thinking? It's offensive."

695
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,400
In Germany, it's... Like I said,
I have a very diverse audience.

696
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,520
When I do a live show in Germany,
I say "Kanake" a lot, casually.

697
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,800
And after one show,

698
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,480
an older, very pretty German lady
approached me and said,

699
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,440
"Miss Amani, that was a great show.

700
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,160
You are a very sweet Kanake."

701
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,840
And I thought, "Fuck, dude!"

702
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,480
And I get a little scared,
because I think it's my fault.

703
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,080
I've said it so often that this woman
thinks it's totally cool to say that.

704
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,040
She might approach someone tomorrow, like,
"Dear Mr. Kanake..."

705
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,960
You have to be a little careful
with these terms.

706
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,400
You just have to relax.
And of course there is... Listen,

707
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,240
when you are between two cultures,

708
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,080
we "ethno-comedians,"
or whatever the hell they call us...

709
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,200
Honor comedian.

710
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,160
I don't know, but of course it's in you,
so it's a big topic for me.

711
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,080
I, for one, am very German in a few ways.

712
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:01,360
For example, I love German engineering.

713
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,880
Now that I can afford it,
I only drive German cars.

714
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,320
Used to be Vietnamese bikes...

715
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
now it's German cars.

716
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,840
I like 'em. But honestly, no kidding,
I only trust German engineering.

717
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,440
Solely and exclusively.

718
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm a little scared of elevators,
I don't like to ride them.

719
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,800
America, France, England,
I don't give a shit where I am,

720
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,280
I only use elevators
that are German TÜV approved.

721
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,160
Only then.

722
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,640
I would never... I don't care which...
It's the only TÜV that I trust.

723
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,080
I know that a German
had to fill out 17 forms for it, right?

724
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,400
Before he even decided on
which screwdriver to use, you know?

725
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,200
I love that correctness. This German...

726
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,440
Not the Iranians!

727
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
I would never, ever...

728
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,280
I love Iranians for other things.

729
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,280
I love Iranians. Very intellectual people,
very... blah, blah, Macedonians...

730
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,680
Anyway, I love them, for sure.

731
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,960
But I would never set foot
in an Iranian elevator. Never!

732
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,280
Because I know that Iranians...
My own family, my father was like,

733
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:14,400
"We'll just take some tape and...
This tape is no problem."

734
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,040
Someone goes,
"But it's dangerous, it could crash."

735
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,280
"That's no problem.

736
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,200
We have a population crisis anyway.

737
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,440
A few can die..."

738
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,680
I called my dad, proudly, I said,

739
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,040
"Dad, I'm the first woman
to get a Netflix Original special."

740
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,640
My dad went, "Who is this Ned Felix?

741
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,360
I don't want you
to talk to this Ned Felix.

742
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,560
What is his ideology?"
You think I'm shitting you, right?

743
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,320
My dad wouldn't care at all
if I told him I had a boyfriend...

744
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,440
I'd like to... I don't know, if it's about
a man and I ask my dad, he'd never...

745
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,680
He wouldn't care how much he makes
or what his profession was.

746
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,400
My father, with his ideology
as a socialist, he'd only ask,

747
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,040
"What are his political views?"

748
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,640
Seriously. Dad would go,
"Does he believe in justice in our world?

749
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,040
What is he doing...?"

750
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,760
I mean it. He wouldn't give a damn.

751
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,840
For him, it would be a negative thing
if I said, "He is very successful."

752
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,920
He'd go, "Why?
He must be taking advantage of people."

753
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,080
When I told him about Netflix, he said,

754
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,680
"An American company?
No. I don't want it.

755
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,720
I don't care who this Felix is.
I don't want it."

756
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,240
Really. I went,
"Dad, they offered so much money."

757
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,360
He was like, "Okay, I want it. I want it.

758
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,720
Gladly. Invite him to dinner. Felix...

759
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,400
Felix should come to dinner tomorrow."

760
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,880
He's still waiting.

761
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,600
Yannis, do you want to come to our house
and play Felix?

762
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,680
My dad still thinks it's a guy.

763
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,800
My life has... Listen, this...

764
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,160
A few things have changed, and I think...
I hate arrogance.

765
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
It's the most revolting thing in the world
when a person is arrogant.

766
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,280
Or a company, a label...
Brands can also be arrogant.

767
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,800
They think they're better than you.
But I like

768
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,880
a healthy bit of swank.

769
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,880
You know wha...?
Especially if you used to have nothing.

770
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,600
You know? Anyone who had...
Understatement is for people

771
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,920
who were raised with a silver spoon,

772
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,080
old money and stuff.
But people like me, with new money,

773
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,600
who didn't have anything,
I want a little swank.

774
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,480
You know, I want...
But you have to be cool about it.

775
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,200
But still, as a comedian,
it's not always easy.

776
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,800
Look, I fly... I fly a lot.

777
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:33,080
Sometimes I fly four, five times a week,

778
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,800
domestic flights in Germany.

779
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,000
I know, it's not good for the environment,

780
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,880
but I always order olive oil onboard.

781
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,960
Anyway, I imagined this to be...
You'd expect it to be really glamorous.

782
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,120
Right? You'd think,
"Wow, I'm sure it's totally..."

783
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,480
That's what I thought, too.

784
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,160
That I would only be booked
on Lufthansa flights,

785
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,520
and that I'd be sitting
in that Senator Lounge.

786
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,120
When you're a comedian...

787
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,240
Honestly, I fly
with the shittiest budget airlines.

788
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,400
The worst imaginable!

789
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,600
I fly with airlines that are...
And I don't mean, like...

790
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,640
I don't know what you're thinking of,

791
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,000
like Air Berlin or Germanwings.
That would be great.

792
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,960
No. I fly with airlines that...

793
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,520
were founded, like, yesterday. That kind.

794
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,480
Like Fatih decided to found an airline

795
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,920
after watching a YouTube tutorial.

796
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,920
The Constitutional Protection Agency
is after him!

797
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,000
But still good enough for Enissa,
you know?

798
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,560
I sit in airlines
with names like "WOW air."

799
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,640
What is this "WOW"?
Who comes up with a name like that?

800
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,080
What does "WOW" stand for?
Maybe, "Wow, we might land" airlines.

801
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,080
Do you know...?
Recently I flew with "Wizz Air."

802
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,160
"Wizz" like "wizard," right?

803
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,400
You don't want to fly with an airline
that's got anything to do with magic.

804
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,960
What is this? I looked out of the window,
the thing didn't even have jet engines.

805
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:03,400
It only had two of these rickety things,
you know?

806
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,640
Nothing! With those airlines,
the stewardesses don't even say,

807
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
"Please fasten your seat belts,"
or "Switch your phones to airplane mode."

808
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,160
They say, "Write a WhatsApp message,
it's gonna be your last."

809
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
I'm serious,
I fly with those kinds of airlines.

810
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,680
And I love flying.
I don't know why, but I love it.

811
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,760
One day when I can afford it,
I want to get my pilot's license, a PPL.

812
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,320
I would love to fly. I know,
the Constitutional Protection Agency

813
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,200
is after me, too, now.
But I'd really like to fly.

814
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
But the thing is... Look.

815
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,040
I always take a window seat,
no matter if it's day or night.

816
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,200
I love it when you're over the clouds.
Here in Germany, it's often drab.

817
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,560
And then you get over the clouds,
and you see the sun,

818
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
and I have... Seriously.

819
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,800
On these domestic flights in Germany,
you often have businessmen

820
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,160
who read their papers,
or work on their laptops.

821
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
I'm the only one...

822
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,320
I always have a window seat,

823
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,080
and my nose is always pressed against
the window like this. Really.

824
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,520
And sometimes, I know it sounds cheesy,

825
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,840
but sometimes I cry
because I find it so beautiful.

826
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
And the people think I'm...

827
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,560
And behind me is a...
You know that little space

828
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:09,680
between the seat and the window?
Sometimes a businessman behind me

829
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,480
looks at me like that, then looks
out the window, then back at me,

830
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,040
and goes, "Is she retarded?
Dude, what's wrong with her?"

831
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,320
Speaking of this word, be relaxed, people.

832
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,240
I had a gig once, and these terms...
Some people go, "Yeah, that's not..."

833
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
I did a show in Cologne...

834
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,040
I don't like it when people
are mindlessly provocative.

835
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,520
I think it's important...
You have a responsibility as a comedian.

836
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,600
You can't tell people,
"Say what you like! Call people that,

837
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:42,960
people of a certain skin color..."
You can't do that, that's just...

838
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,040
But still, a certain relaxed manner...

839
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,120
So I had a gig in Cologne,
and I really dished it out that night.

840
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,000
To Germans, Iranians, to myself, to gays.

841
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,280
There was a table full of gays,
and they yelled,

842
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,320
"Another gay joke, Enissa, another one!"

843
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,720
On the other side,
a table full of Muslim guys,

844
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
they were like...

845
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,640
God, I love this moment.

846
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,040
Look, all the Kanakes laughed,

847
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:11,000
and all the Germans are confused.
It's so cute.

848
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,560
The Germans are like, "Astarfurghillah?"

849
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,760
Look how sweet they look.
"Tim, do you know what that means?

850
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,720
Is that a gorilla? What does she mean?"

851
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,280
"You better ask Fatih."

852
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,800
It's irrelevant to the story.
It encourages communication.

853
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,880
After the show,
you can all ask Fatih what it means.

854
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,440
It's irrelevant to this story.

855
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,960
I was just saying, I did a gig
and dished it out in every direction.

856
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,240
There was a lady on the right...

857
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,520
I mentioned earlier that we
often have people with disabilities.

858
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,600
There was a lady in a wheelchair
on the right, on her own.

859
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,960
I didn't want to make disability jokes.

860
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:49,560
I thought it was moronic.
Why would I make wheelchair jokes,

861
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,720
because the poor lady
was sitting there alone...

862
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,920
Why are you even laughing?
"Ha-ha, she's disabled."

863
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,200
Anyway...

864
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,200
One lady in a wheelchair.
She was laughing,

865
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,280
but as the show went on,
she grew more and more serious.

866
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,440
And I was watching her, I thought,
"Okay, what's wrong?

867
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,080
I want her to have fun. What's going on?"

868
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,200
She came to the signing session
after the show,

869
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,320
and I asked her, "Hi, what's your name?"
She went, "Sandra."

870
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,600
I said, "Dear Sandra, what happened?
I saw you getting more and more serious.

871
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,760
Did you not enjoy the show? What was it?"

872
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:16,920
She's sitting in a wheelchair before me,
she goes,

873
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,840
"To be honest,
I found your show a little retarded."

874
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,640
You're laughing,
but I was really shocked.

875
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,480
But I thought it was really cool.

876
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,680
I was like,
"Wow, she used that word so casually!"

877
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,440
That was great,
but I didn't know how to react.

878
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,720
So I went,
"What exactly do you mean? What...?

879
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,080
I mean, what...?
You, as an honor handicapped,

880
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,040
what was...? What do you mean?"

881
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,840
I'm telling you, this is true.

882
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,560
It was so cute. She said, "You know,
I liked it that you had a message,

883
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,840
and that you dished it out
in every direction,

884
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,800
to blah, gays, Germans, Iranians...

885
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,000
To everyone.
But I was the only woman in a wheelchair,

886
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:59,200
and you didn't make a single
disability joke, so I felt left out."

887
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,960
Really, that happened.

888
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,040
She said to me, "I felt left out."

889
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,120
I was like, "All right!

890
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,840
No disability jokes...
Okay, stand up, I'll tell you one. Okay?"

891
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,800
Because she...

892
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,160
A relaxed manner.

893
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,640
So these airlines...

894
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,800
I told you I love flying,
and in those airlines...

895
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,480
Everything I love about flying
is not present in those airlines.

896
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,680
For instance, I like that stewardesses,
or stewards, for the gay audience...

897
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,720
That stewardesses speak so many languages.

898
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,480
I find that really impressive.

899
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,400
At Lufthansa, I think they
have to speak two or three languages.

900
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,320
Emirates is even more badass,
they have to be at least quadrilingual.

901
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,680
Fatih, that means
"speaking four languages."

902
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,840
Look how I'm playing to clichés
and everyone's loving it.

903
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,480
You have no idea!

904
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,640
You don't know...
That was a dumb cliché joke.

905
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,680
Fatih, dear, what did you study?
Please say...

906
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,720
What did you study?

907
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,040
Nothing, bro? Lie! Why don't you lie?
I dropped out, too!

908
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,520
Just say anything!

909
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:11,560
No? What do you do for a living?

910
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,080
But look, that's also a Kana...
It's so cute. Listen.

911
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,720
There's no way
he isn't doing anything, right?

912
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,960
Listen, don't get mixed up,
it's a mentality thing.

913
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,720
If you ask a German...
That's what I like about them.

914
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:25,520
Germans give you a correct,
straightforward answer,

915
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,040
no matter... An honest answer
in more detail than you asked for.

916
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,360
Ask them about their profession.
So cute, they're gonna say,

917
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,920
"Well, I'm an apprentice,
going on to be a gas station attendant

918
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,480
for the Shell company,
and I'm in my third year of training."

919
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,440
Sweet, right? Typically German.

920
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,240
A Kanake, never, ever.

921
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,840
You ask a Kanake, "What do you do?"
he says, "What do you need?"

922
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,880
You recognize that?
"I just asked what you do..."

923
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,440
"Yeah, what do you need?
I can get you anything."

924
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,880
You know someone like that?

925
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,480
"I know someone who knows someone
who knows someone who can get it."

926
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,280
When I started making money,

927
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,080
the first thing I wanted to buy
was a horse.

928
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,360
Some girls at elementary school
had a horse,

929
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,560
and I had this complex, like,
"Man, I want a horse, too,

930
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,360
so I can groom it and stuff."

931
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,440
I don't know, I knew you could comb...
Whatever.

932
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,640
An honor horse.

933
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,160
Anyway, I wanted to buy an honor horse,
so I googled it

934
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:23,040
and saw that they are really expensive.
It starts at 5000 euros.

935
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,800
So I asked a Kanake friend of mine,
"Hey, I'd like to buy a horse..."

936
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,480
He's like, "I can get it."

937
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,480
I went, "Are you sure?
The cheapest is like 5000 euros."

938
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,200
"I'll get it for 500."

939
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,320
I was like, "Really?", he said yeah,
so I gave him 500.

940
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,480
The next day, he came back with a donkey.

941
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,320
"Here, a little horse."

942
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,960
Germans...

943
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,880
I've said many things I like about them,
but they also piss me off, I swear.

944
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,560
Right? It's both. There are things I love
and things I hate about Iranians.

945
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:01,320
There are things... Except Macedonians,
I love everything about them.

946
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,320
But there are things that...
Look, Germans with their...

947
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,400
That's just how it is, Yannis.
You know? They are so...

948
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,160
I think it's cute, actually,
but they love their rules.

949
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,960
Wow, yeah, Germans love rules.
They love them!

950
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:16,440
Listen, try this. Germans are a little
like German bus schedules.

951
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,560
You think I'm talking nonsense.
In the whole wide world,

952
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:23,200
it's only on German bus schedules

953
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,440
where there are times like...
The bus arrives at 2:08 p.m.

954
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,080
2:08 p.m.?

955
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,280
Hang on, I talked about that in Iran...

956
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,720
and my cousins laughed so hard...

957
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,240
They laughed so hard, they...

958
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,200
I get why. In Iran,
the bus arrives when it feels like it.

959
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,240
It's like, "Maybe I come today,
or maybe not.

960
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:52,040
I'm against bus driving, anyway.

961
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,920
It doesn't fit my ideology."

962
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,440
Germans... No, really,
my cousins laughed so hard,

963
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,120
that at some point, I was offended.
The German in me was offended.

964
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,000
I was like, "Why are they even laughing?
It's a good thing that..."

965
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:10,600
But I have to say, the funny thing isn't
that the bus schedule says 2:08 p.m.

966
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,840
The funny thing is that at 2:07 p.m.,

967
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,600
it comes around the corner...

968
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,080
and at 2:08 p.m., it really is there.

969
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,480
And we all get mad
if it arrives at 2:09 p.m.

970
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,000
Because...

971
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,280
Because we'll...

972
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,040
Because then we'll miss our train...

973
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,280
which arrives at 2:23 p.m.

974
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,080
We need to adapt to the system.

975
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,680
This straightfor... This is also something
that's just very typical of Germany.

976
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,360
I know some people are sitting here
and are smiling at me pleasantly,

977
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,440
but they feel kind of busted.

978
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,440
Only in Germany can you stand
next to a completely empty street...

979
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,000
Completely empty, nothing.

980
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,880
For example, a farm lane. Doesn't matter.

981
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:08,720
Someplace where there's nothing
and nobody for miles and miles.

982
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,280
Look miles ahead in both directions...
You can look light-years into the future

983
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,960
and light-years into the past.

984
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,840
No cars, nothing. But one red light...

985
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,240
Hang on.

986
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,120
Not even a child. That I would understand.

987
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,200
A child stands there,
it's supposed to learn,

988
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,840
you cross, they follow...
No, that's not cool.

989
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,960
But let's say you're alone,
or only with a couple of grown-ups.

990
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,400
And you can see for miles.

991
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,200
What happens? I swear, it happened to me.

992
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,920
I was alone.
I crossed against the red light.

993
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,640
What happened?
Out of nowhere, a German pops up!

994
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,560
Out of nowhere!
He came out of the ground like a carrot.

995
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:57,640
You know? Suddenly, like...
Boom! There's a German.

996
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,960
And what does he do?
He screams, "It's a red light!"

997
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:04,080
I'll tell you what I honestly think.

998
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,520
I want to openly admit it.
I'm in the street,

999
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,560
and no matter who screamed,
German or not, I don't care.

1000
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,000
I'm in the street, and I'm thinking,

1001
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,960
"Please die. Please croak.

1002
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,640
Dear God, please let him be struck
by lightning right now!"

1003
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,040
An honor lightning bolt. Because...

1004
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,720
Look, I don't get it. I'm a grown woman.

1005
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,920
There are no cars, nothing.

1006
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,040
Even if there was one,
it's not a highway.

1007
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:35,240
I can assess its speed,
I'm not a Macedonian.

1008
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,040
I can see if...

1009
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,440
Not Germans.

1010
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,880
Seriously. Not Germans.
One of my best friends, Julia...

1011
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,200
We've been friends since I was little.
If Julia has to break a rule,

1012
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,920
she can't do it. She gets diarrhea.
You know? She can't...

1013
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,680
She just can't.
I say, "Julia, come on, let's go."

1014
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,000
She's like,
"But it's a red light, Enissa!"

1015
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,480
I go, "But there are no cars!"
"But it's a red light!"

1016
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,800
She's adorable.
"You can't assess their speed."

1017
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,240
I'm like, "There's nothing to assess."

1018
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,360
It drives me crazy.

1019
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,320
Anyway, those budget airlines...

1020
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,720
I hate those.

1021
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,880
I love it when stewardesses
speak several languages.

1022
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:20,240
That's what I call a clean segue.
I'm so good!

1023
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,040
I love it when stewardesses...

1024
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:26,840
I see a weird camera too close
for comfort. Did you put a filter on it?

1025
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,840
Is there a filter on it?

1026
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:30,360
Thank you.

1027
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,560
I've... Those budget airlines...

1028
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,120
I love it when stewardesses
switch between languages.

1029
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,760
When they speak different languages

1030
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,560
and switch easily between them. I love it.

1031
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:48,840
You're just staring.
She speaks one language, then another.

1032
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,760
Not with... The airlines I travel with,

1033
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:55,720
there's usually
a gorgeous Ukrainian stewardess...

1034
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:59,840
who can barely speak Ukrainian.

1035
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,760
And the funny thing is,
she tries to sell me stuff in English.

1036
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:07,880
You know how those airlines are.
You get no water, no food.

1037
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,400
You don't get anything.
You can starve or die of thirst. Nothing.

1038
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,280
But they are trying to sell you stuff.
Perfume, for instance.

1039
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,320
You know those perfumes that not even
perfume shops can get rid of?

1040
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:20,680
Like Davidoff Cool Water.

1041
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,160
Which smells nice, right? I liked it, too.
When I was 24...

1042
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,240
Or Jil Sander Sun.

1043
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,080
She knows it, she's wearing it.

1044
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,200
Anyway, it's... It smells nice, too!

1045
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,560
But they've been around
for a million years.

1046
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,080
And that's what the stewardess
tries to sell me

1047
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,520
on this plane
where I'm about to die of thirst.

1048
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,360
The stewardess says stuff
on the intercom like...

1049
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:54,480
And I'm sitting there thinking,
"What kind of spee-cial offer?

1050
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,200
What's her spee-cial offer?"

1051
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,440
You know what her spee-cial...?
I get really curious and I want to know.

1052
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,120
Her spee-cial offer is something like,
"Paco by Paco Rabanne...

1053
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,520
And I'm thinking, "What 29.99?

1054
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,360
I'm sitting on a flight for 4.99 euros

1055
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,800
from Cologne to Berlin,

1056
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,680
and if I had 29.99,
I'd be flying with Lufthansa.

1057
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,240
What 29.99 do you want?"

1058
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,600
But everything... Wait, hang on! Wait.

1059
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,480
Everything...

1060
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,960
Everything is a spee-cial offer,
everything.

1061
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:32,200
Like I said, you don't get food or drinks,
but you can buy them.

1062
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:34,880
She comes to your seat and asks,
"Are you hungry?"

1063
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:40,040
And then, "We have a spee-cial offer..."
And then she says, "Our chhhef..."

1064
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,800
Meaning "our chef."

1065
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,360
She wants to tell me
there's a chef de cuisine.

1066
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,320
She's trying to convince me
they have an actual chef back there.

1067
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,240
Seriously. She says,
"Our chef is making chicken marsala."

1068
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,080
I go, "What chef are you talking about?"

1069
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,320
There's some guy
called Dmitri back there...

1070
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,320
who's pulling the foil off
some thingies...

1071
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,600
and that's what she's trying to sell me
as "our chef."

1072
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,320
There's a Dmitri in the audience
who's really offended now.

1073
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:13,320
"I hate this bitch!"
All right, I'll skip that bit.

1074
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,560
Anyway...

1075
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,640
Everything is a spee-cial offer.
But still, on those flights there are...

1076
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,720
This is the ridiculous part.

1077
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,360
Because, actually,
it's great that it's so cheap.

1078
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,520
You can fly for cheap.

1079
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,320
Okay, it's bad for the environment,
but who gives a shit?

1080
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,120
And then you're on this flight,
and there are arrogant people there.

1081
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,000
You know? There's a guy on this flight

1082
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,880
who asks that poor, swamped stewardess
something like,

1083
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:40,160
What kind of vodkas...?
Are you serious, man?

1084
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,480
You think that woman
has different kinds of vodka,

1085
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,400
that she can give you some expensive...?
I don't know, Crystal,

1086
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,800
Grey Goose or whatever they're called.

1087
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,200
The poor stewardess is totally overwhelmed
and goes, "Moskovskaya?

1088
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,000
And spee-cial offer Gorbatschow?"

1089
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,920
And these... I told you before,

1090
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,480
not only are people arrogant,
brands are, too.

1091
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,480
What's the saying?
"Small dogs bark the loudest?"

1092
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:13,320
These airlines are often
so arrogant in their demeanor

1093
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,640
and in terms of what they offer.

1094
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,320
They offer their passengers
various "classes" and "upgrades."

1095
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,480
You can have different memberships
and stuff.

1096
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,720
You know what I mean, like Gold member...

1097
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,120
That's how they call their passengers
to the gate. You're at the gate,

1098
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,840
and she's like, "Now our Premium Platinum
Golden members..."

1099
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,880
What is that? Nobody stands up. No one!

1100
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,720
Nobody wants that!
Because I have to fly with them so often,

1101
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,840
I am a Premium Platinum
fucking Golden member by now.

1102
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:46,000
I'd never stand up! I don't want to be
the first one on that plane

1103
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,440
and die from a gas leak in there.
I don't want that!

1104
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,400
I'm hoping, and I remain seated
until the very end.

1105
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,520
But nobody stands up. She goes,
"Now our Silver members,

1106
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,040
now our this or that members..."

1107
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,360
And then she says,
"Now our disabled members..."

1108
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,240
Their handicapped passengers!

1109
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,200
And I was thinking... Handicapped.
And I was like... I was so shocked.

1110
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,280
"What's that supposed to mean?
What 'disabled members'?"

1111
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:14,720
I thought, "Maybe she just means
that passengers with a disability

1112
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:18,240
should board first so they can be seated
and can put away their luggage easily."

1113
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,160
Makes sense, right?

1114
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:24,200
But then she says,
"Now our Premium disabled members..."

1115
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,360
I thought,
"What is 'Premium handicapped,' dude?

1116
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,080
What on earth is that?"

1117
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,400
But then a woman rolled past me
in a wheelchair,

1118
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:37,120
a lowered wheelchair, chrome rims...

1119
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,280
Not kidding.

1120
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,720
Like, all over.

1121
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,320
Louis Vuitton all over.

1122
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:49,840
And, looking at me condescendingly,
she went,

1123
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,600
"I'm Premium disabled."

1124
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,560
I went, "Yeah, I can tell."

1125
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,160
You know how these airlines make money?

1126
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,240
It doesn't do any good to fly with them.
Why?

1127
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,360
You paid a small amount for the flight,
but you land at some random airport

1128
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:11,120
that has nothing to do with the city
that's actually your destination!

1129
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,360
You know those airports specifically built
for such budget airlines?

1130
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,440
They're located, like, 5000 km away
from the city they were named after.

1131
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,360
It makes absolutely no sense.
Take Frankfurt, for example.

1132
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,760
For Frankfurt am Main,
there is Frankfurt-Hahn.

1133
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,960
Frankfurt-Hahn feels like it's located
7000 km outside of Frankfurt.

1134
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,360
It's closer to Vietnam
than it is to Frankfurt.

1135
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,640
How could I possibly benefit
from landing there?

1136
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,320
Same thing in Düsseldorf.
They have an airport called Weeze.

1137
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,560
Düsseldorf Weeze
is in the middle of nowhere,

1138
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,960
there is nothing.
It's in the middle of a forest.

1139
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,520
There are, like, three pedophiles and me.

1140
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:49,880
That's where I land.

1141
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,400
How am I supposed to get home from there?

1142
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,880
No one is picking you up,
there are no buses, no trains, nothing.

1143
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,240
I asked this Premium disabled lady
if I could "roll with her."

1144
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,080
I want to get home, man!

1145
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,560
Everything is a spee-cial offer
on that flight.

1146
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,840
These flights... I told you I like flying.
You know what else I like?

1147
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:21,600
Gateways. Gateways are these things,
these... I like them. These tubes...

1148
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,400
They have their own little cart,

1149
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:26,120
and sometimes you see them rolling up
like some cartoon.

1150
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,520
They dock onto the plane, and you can walk
straight from the plane to the concourse.

1151
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,000
I like it, it's so elegant. You know?

1152
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:36,200
You have your headphones on
and walk from the plane to the concourse.

1153
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,360
Not on the airlines I fly with!

1154
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,600
No, there you have to change buses
three times, change trains four times,

1155
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,840
then you have to canoe, dude...

1156
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,920
Then you end up on a runway.

1157
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,040
You don't know
where you're supposed to walk.

1158
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,520
Though, in Germany, it's organized.
There's always a German

1159
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,200
who shows you exactly
where on the runway...

1160
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,280
You shouldn't wander around on the runway,
especially if you're Iranian.

1161
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,760
It's like, "Please walk that way."

1162
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,760
This whole Germans and Kanakes thing,
I'd like to say something in conclusion.

1163
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,480
I explained it earlier, like,
with an immigration background or...

1164
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:10,000
Complete bullshit.
It depends on your attitude.

1165
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:13,000
What are you more of? Are you a little bit
of a Kanake, of a German, a bit of both?

1166
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,440
I have both in me.

1167
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,800
You see it in the things that people do.

1168
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,080
Would you cross against a red light
if there are no cars around or not?

1169
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,120
Both things are all right, okay? But...

1170
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,920
I have a great example.

1171
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,720
My manager is Iranian.

1172
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,280
He's my tour manager.
He drives me from one place to another.

1173
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,960
He's a proper Iranian, with a complicated
Iranian first and last name.

1174
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:39,400
But I'm telling you, he is the most German
German on this planet.

1175
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:42,360
Why? Because he goes fishing, dude.

1176
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,480
Who goes fishing?!

1177
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,200
He loves fishing, seriously.

1178
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:50,640
There are things...

1179
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,680
A Kanake would never do that!
And he's so cute, he gets so proud.

1180
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,800
You have to imagine,
he drives me from place to place,

1181
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,080
and then he tells me,

1182
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:01,520
"Enissa, yesterday, I caught a zander."

1183
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:05,880
And I'm like, "Why, man? You can buy one
that's already dead at Rewe."

1184
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:10,080
He's so cute, so I tease him, I go,

1185
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,960
"Surely you do
other typical stuff as well, right?

1186
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,480
Like, you strap..."
He has an adorable family.

1187
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:20,520
"You guys strap your bikes
to the roof of your car,
