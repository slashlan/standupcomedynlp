1
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,079
Yes.

2
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:53,320
Yes. All right.

3
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,389
Yeah.

4
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,798
All right. Just relax.

5
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,234
We're fucking here, doing this in Canada.

6
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,335
I'm happy about that.

7
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:15,776
Look at this crowd. Yo, all right.
I know, uh...

8
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,779
I know I look like a tired eagle. Um...

9
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,588
I don't like how you laughed,
to be honest. It's fine...

10
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,290
It's fine that you laughed at it,

11
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,626
but the way you laughed at it was shitty,
you know?

12
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,494
You laughed like you realized it.

13
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,865
Ha, ha, oh.

14
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,872
Eagles are cool, though. They're fucking...
You know what I mean?

15
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:47,841
They do that shit.

16
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,244
I don't look like that eagle
that would be like fucking...

17
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,680
I look like an eagle
that would be like this: Caw.

18
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:57,284
You know what I mean? Like... just tired
as shit, stuck in traffic:

19
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,385
Caw.

20
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,559
I've been thinking about
the way I look a lot lately

21
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,327
because I'm finally the age I look.

22
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,396
I'm like...
I always looked older than I was,

23
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,898
but now I'm 36
and that's a hundred percent obvious.

24
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:14,835
Like... it's... Like...
Here's what I mean "I'm the age I look."

25
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,537
When I say I'm 36,
nobody in here goes like this:

26
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:18,805
"No." You know?

27
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:24,678
Like, I'm an adult. It's fucking crazy
to realize yourself as an adult, right?

28
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:29,182
I mean, I've been an adult for a while,
but I just kind of... Recently it sunk in.

29
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,786
Here's what happened when I realized it.
I saw a picture, uh, of me

30
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,755
and I didn't recognize me.

31
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,623
I just saw, like, an adult male.

32
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:40,460
I literally saw me and I thought,
"Fuck that guy. He looks creepy."

33
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:44,264
That's what I thought. I was like,
"I don't like his whole story. Fuck him."

34
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,900
And then I realized it was me.
I look like that.

35
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,936
I look like a guy that'd fuck your girl
and then be like:

36
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,905
"That's the game."
You know what I mean?

37
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,374
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.

38
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,845
I'm so fucking 36, man.

39
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,816
When I was in my 20s
I was a completely different person.

40
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,452
I don't...
I feel girls say shit like that, actually.

41
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,622
I don't mean it like that.
I feel like girls say dramatic shit like:

42
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,724
"I used to be
a completely different person."

43
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,262
I feel like when a girl says it, it means
she used to fuck a lot, you know?

44
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,433
I feel like when a girl says that,
part of her thinks

45
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:22,469
that she was someone else for real.
She'll be, "No, for real.

46
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,905
I used to be a little Japanese man,"
or whatever.

47
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,908
Like, "No, you weren't." "Oh, really?

48
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,777
Then explain this:"

49
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,247
You're like, "Okay, I don't wanna argue.

50
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,349
You were Japanese for a summer
or something."

51
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,988
Ha, ha. I don't mean
I was a different person.

52
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:43,957
I was a lot different than I am now.

53
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,224
And I was, dude.

54
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,393
Just take ten years ago.

55
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,262
When I was 26 I was married,
which is crazy.

56
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:52,632
Which... And that's true.
But by the way, don't do that. Uh, yeah.

57
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:56,870
I don't bad-mouth marriage.
You can get married and it can work out,

58
00:03:56,937 --> 00:04:00,240
but not if you're 26 and a dude.
That's way too young, okay?

59
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,976
I mean, maybe some of you are 26
and married out there,

60
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,312
in which case, oops,
but you know what I mean?

61
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,447
It's not gonna work out, you know?

62
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,417
I mean, it might, but it won't.
You know what I mean?

63
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,519
But it could,
but it's not going to, right?

64
00:04:12,886 --> 00:04:16,556
But some are like, "This one's special."
And you're wrong, but, uh...

65
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,360
Yeah, you're not special.
You're just somebody.

66
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,830
That's fucked up.
We're not special at all.

67
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:24,897
That's so fucked.

68
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,703
We're not.

69
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:32,739
We're not special. We're just people.

70
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,375
It's fucked up to think about, right?

71
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,787
I know when I say that
I lose some people in the audience.

72
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,713
They're like, "Well, yeah, I mean...

73
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:46,720
Speak for yourself, but... I'm special
'cause I bought a vest a week ago."

74
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,989
Or whatever the fuck you think
makes you special.

75
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,559
Of course we think we're special.
We live in a society

76
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,795
that fucking makes us feel that way,
right?

77
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,863
We're all individuals and shit, right?

78
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,833
Well, we... People told us that
ever since we were little kids.

79
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,737
Your parents or if you had shitty parents,
your teachers told us that shit, right?

80
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,674
I had a teacher that used to be like,
"Remember, you're your own snowflake."

81
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,512
As a 4-year-old, you're like, "Okay,
I'm a little bit of snowflake, I guess."

82
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,980
Like, that's weird as shit.

83
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,451
And you carry on the tradition.

84
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,687
We fucking make... You... You got kids,

85
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:23,056
you make them feel special,
you lie to them. You do.

86
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,992
You say shit like, "You can do anything
you put your mind to."

87
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:27,994
What the fuck? No, you can't.

88
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,665
No. No, you can't. No, you can't. No.

89
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:34,534
So many things you can't do
even if you put your mind to it.

90
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,969
Most things you can't do.

91
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:38,438
A lot of you guys
couldn't even get here on time.

92
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,513
Things are hard as shit.

93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,115
We can all do, like, four or five things,
tops.

94
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,718
We try things,
but halfway through we're like:

95
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,486
"Fuck it, I'm hungry." And we quit.

96
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,989
We give up 'cause shit is hard as fuck.

97
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,425
I'm wrong about this?

98
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,095
You can do anything you put your mind to.
Really? Shit out of your eyes. Do that.

99
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:05,498
Try it. Do it.
Fucking put your mind to it.

100
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,802
Try every day for the rest of your life.

101
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:11,671
It'll always come out
of your asshole first every single time.

102
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:14,040
This is you every day.
"Back to the drawing board."

103
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:17,577
That's you every day
with a high dry cleaning bill

104
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,845
'cause you shit your pants.

105
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,516
We're not special.

106
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,719
But of course you feel that way.

107
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:28,665
I saw some of you walk in here tonight.
You're like, "Fucking here I am."

108
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:33,059
You only think that 'cause you're you.
That's why.

109
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,930
If you were someone else, might be like,
"Fuck that guy. I don't like his vest."

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,969
That's the problem, really,
is that you've always only been you.

111
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:45,772
That's the problem.
You've never been anyone else, right?

112
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:48,575
So, you're important
'cause you live inside your body.

113
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,043
You're looking out of your eyes.

114
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,779
And if someone pokes you, you're like,
"Fucking hey.

115
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,784
Don't make me start a hashtag on Twitter."

116
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,890
You know how you know
that we think we're special? Because...

117
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:06,159
Here's why. 'Cause movies make money.
That's why.

118
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,095
'Cause we think we're special.
'Cause we'll sit in the theater

119
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,965
and watch Denzel Washington
and be like, "You know what?

120
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,167
Fucking that's me.

121
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,671
I'm fucking Denzel in my life.

122
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,873
If my life were a movie,
I will be the lead.

123
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,075
I'm the Denzel Washington part."

124
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,577
No, you're not the fucking
Denzel Washington part.

125
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:28,014
What part you are? Denzel Washington
walks up to you like, "Where is she?"

126
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:31,084
And then you go like this, "I don't know."
That's you.

127
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,022
You think you're Denzel?
Think you walk into a room full of cops

128
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,526
with a bunch of confidence and swagger?
Just like "So, what do we got?"

129
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,227
No. That's what Denzel does.

130
00:07:41,494 --> 00:07:44,497
You're the guy afterwards
with a bunch of graphs and spreadsheets

131
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,066
and you're like, "Uh, excuse me, sir.

132
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:49,202
I... I... I have a bunch of facts
that pertain to the case ahead."

133
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,505
And he's like, "Shut the fuck up!"
And you go: "Oh, Oh!"

134
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,942
And the spreadsheets fly everywhere,
you bitch ass. That's you.

135
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,515
You're not fucking Denzel.

136
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,518
You think you are?
You think you're the man on fire?

137
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:06,786
Is that what you think?

138
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:09,089
You think you walk out of a car
in slow motion

139
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,091
with the music blaring in the background?

140
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:17,063
No. When you get out of your car,
the music stops.

141
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:19,833
'Cause it was on the radio in your car.

142
00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:22,268
You don't get out on a mission

143
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:25,572
with a beautiful dove
flying out of your backseat.

144
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,743
And the wind casually flipping
your Hawaiian shirt up, exposing your abs.

145
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,911
You don't even have abs, you fat fuck.

146
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,848
You don't get out like:

147
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,151
You get out and it's like:

148
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,921
Fat. Fat fuck.

149
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,125
Fuck a dove. There's a pigeon at best.

150
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,528
And it's fatter than you are.
Can't even get off the ground.

151
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,997
It's eating Doritos out of your car
when you got out,

152
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,699
you fucking piggy fat fuck.

153
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:55,934
Yeah!

154
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,936
You're not...

155
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,606
You're not Denzel.

156
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,207
You're not the man on fire.

157
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,677
You think you are. A lot of you think
I'm talking about other people.

158
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,180
You are other people to other people.

159
00:09:08,648 --> 00:09:12,052
You think you're the fucking man.
You think that's your movie, you fucking...

160
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:16,556
You think if someone pulled a gun on you,
you might, "Do it. Come on, motherfucker.

161
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:19,159
Let's see what you got.
Come on, show me the balls you got."

162
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,329
No way. Neither would I.
I'm not saying I'm better than that.

163
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,299
Here's me or anybody in here
if we got a gun pulled on us.

164
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,700
This is what we would do:

165
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,137
"Take my girl, take my girl.

166
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,873
You can fuck her."

167
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:39,712
You're not Denzel.

168
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,616
You're not the man on fire. Right?
Life's not your movie,

169
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:45,919
that's what I'm trying to say.
Makes sense, right?

170
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:49,656
You know what life is more like?
We're all extras in someone else's movie.

171
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,292
That's what it's more like, right?
And you guys believe me.

172
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,761
You're like, 70, 75 percent there.
You're like:

173
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:58,231
"Well, yeah,
I mean... Chris D'Elia is right,

174
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:04,137
but... also, ha, ha...
I'm a little bit Denzel." Right?

175
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,608
You know what that is? That's your ego.
That's... I have that, too.

176
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:10,944
I have that ego.
You live life like it's your movie

177
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,613
because you don't wanna be
the bitch-ass extra, right?

178
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,715
I certainly...
I orchestrate my life that way.

179
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,984
I feel like I'm the lead of my movie
right now.

180
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:21,387
I'm on-stage yelling into a microphone
at you guys.

181
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,656
I'm like,
"It's like this. It's like that."

182
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,626
You guys are all looking back at me like,
"Yeah, he's right."

183
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,129
It feels like it's my movie, but it's not.

184
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:32,065
In real life, the movie
is probably about a couple arguing.

185
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,167
And the girl gets so mad
that she storms out.

186
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,704
And this is just a scene at the Vogue
in fucking Vancouver, Canada.

187
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,374
Yeah.

188
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,678
I'm not even Chris D'Elia in this movie.

189
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,113
I'm comedian number six.

190
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,316
But you try, right?

191
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,784
You try 'cause you have to.

192
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,720
You try to make life yours, right?

193
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:56,756
Life throws what it throws you
and you roll with the punches.

194
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,424
That's what happened to me, you know?

195
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,095
I met a girl and I hung out with her
for too long, and then...

196
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:07,000
Then I loved her. By the way,
that's what love is. That's what it is.

197
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:09,769
Hanging out with someone for too long.
That's what it is.

198
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,739
It's true. Fuck these movies.
They glorify love.

199
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,974
Two people in the rain,
looking at each other,

200
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,077
not giving a shit it's raining
'cause they're holding eye contact.

201
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,213
Right?
They're just like, "I fucking love you.

202
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,282
Ah. You're my soul mate.

203
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,217
I'm so lucky I found you.

204
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,152
Why am I the one that's so lucky?

205
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,855
I can't belie... I miss you when I blink."

206
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,231
"Where did you go?"
"Oh, I was just blinking."

207
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,968
That's not what people say
as it starts raining.

208
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:45,071
You know what people say?
No matter how much in love they are,

209
00:11:45,138 --> 00:11:47,774
no matter how much eye contact,
this is what we say:

210
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,176
"Hey. Ah. Let's go inside."
That's what we say.

211
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,146
Love is not that certain.

212
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,283
If I could pick two words that love is,
it's right here: "I guess."

213
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,354
Love is "I guess."
You find yourself your "I guess" person

214
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:03,856
and have an "I guess" family.
That's what you do.

215
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:07,226
And then you "I guess" your way
all throughout life. That's what you do.

216
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:11,297
You say, "Yeah, let's get married,
I guess, and then have kids, I guess,

217
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:15,001
and feed them,
I guess, uh... every day, I guess.

218
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,136
And take a trip if we have the money,
I guess.

219
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,106
And when I'm sick, make me soup
if you're in the mood, I guess.

220
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,976
And then when you die,
I'll be right by your side.

221
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:27,180
I guess. I don't know. That's so far away.
At this point, I hope I go first."

222
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,422
Love is "I guess."

223
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:39,392
If you're sure you're not in love,
that's not what love is.

224
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,995
Think about the people in your life
that knew they were in love.

225
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,130
Think about those people.
"I fucking love her.

226
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,866
Hundred percent know it.
I knew it as soon as I saw her.

227
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,535
You can't convince me otherwise.
She's so easy to be around.

228
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:51,304
She's basically me."

229
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:55,485
Right? And then a year later you're like,
"How is she?" "Oh, that bitch was crazy."

230
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,112
'Cause that's not love.
That's <i>The Notebook</i>.

231
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:01,814
That's <i>Jerry Mc-fucking-Guire,</i> okay?

232
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:03,549
And those movies ended early.

233
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,953
They were two hours, not 40 fucking years.

234
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,390
You know I'm right.
That's why you're laughing.

235
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:14,027
'Cause you've been in love or are now,
and know that love is up and down.

236
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,397
And up and down and up and down
and down more and down

237
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,799
and up a little bit,
but then down, down, down.

238
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:22,802
Down, down, not up, down, down, down.

239
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,539
And you're both stuck down there and like,
"At least we have each other."

240
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:27,806
That's what love is.

241
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,110
And then you meet other couples
down there

242
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:33,379
and you, like, do dinners with them
or some shit.

243
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,214
Fuck those dinners.

244
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,884
A lot of you guys
are probably on those dinners right now.

245
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:46,025
A lot of you guy... Look, sometimes
people think what I'm saying is negative

246
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,560
because I'm saying love is shitty.

247
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,863
But that's not negative
that love is shitty. You know why?

248
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,033
'Cause love is shitty because it fucking
has to be. You know why?

249
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,903
Because it's awesome, too.
That's how everything in life is.

250
00:13:56,969 --> 00:14:00,273
Everything that's good is equally
that bad. That's yin and yang of life.

251
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,408
Take anything you like.
It's equally that bad.

252
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,911
Kit Kats. You love Kit Kats, right?
Eat them up.

253
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,379
"Oh, man, I love these Kit Kats.

254
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,948
Oh, they're so chocolatey.
Break me off another one.

255
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:12,051
I love these Kit Kats.
Why are they so good?" They are, until:

256
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,455
That's the bad part. That's the bad part.

257
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,457
You're sitting on the toilet, thinking:

258
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,560
"Oh, man, I can't ever eat
any more Kit Kats ever again."

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,364
It's the same thing as love. Chipotle,
Chipotle, Chipotle. Love, love, love.

260
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,598
Love is Chipotle.

261
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,600
Dude, this isn't even a comedy show.

262
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,535
It's a fucking TED Talk, okay?

263
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,476
Oh, fuck it.

264
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,148
Love is shitty. And that's okay.

265
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,386
Sometimes if... If you're with somebody,
you go to sleep shitty and wake up shitty.

266
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,522
And by the way, you sleep shitty, too.
Sometimes.

267
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,924
If you don't wake up every two hours

268
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:56,195
and think something like "did this bitch
turn off the humidifier?" that's not love.

269
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,401
And then you wake up with chapped lips
and blame each other. That's love.

270
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:04,670
You're like, "Yo, did you turn
this shit off? What the fuck?

271
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,409
You did... My...
Side of my mouth is cracking now...

272
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:14,180
when I open it like that. The bad side.
What the fuck? You didn't turn it off.

273
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:18,084
You didn't turn it off. Who came in here?
Humidifier fairy came and did that shit?

274
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,620
My mommy came over at 2:30 in the morning
and did that?"

275
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:30,630
That's what love is. Know what love is?
If I could distill love down

276
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:34,167
into one moment, this right here
would be the moment of love right here.

277
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,035
"Fucking move.

278
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:40,239
Move over.

279
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,409
Look at the other side of the bed.
Look at that area. Look at that...

280
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,978
Stop gazing into my fucking eyes
for two seconds

281
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,680
and look at the other area.

282
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,216
And then look at this zero area
I've got over here.

283
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,218
Look at that vast area.

284
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,188
They shot <i>Mad Max</i>
on the other side of you.

285
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,108
Tom Hardy's over there
on the front of a vehicle like:

286
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,562
And I'm over here with my leg
and my dick flopped off the bed.

287
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,331
Explain that. Explain why my dick
is flopped off the bed.

288
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:09,101
They shot <i>Mad Max </i>and<i> Dances With Wolves</i>
on the other side of you.

289
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:14,073
Kevin Costner's over there
with a water buffalo just like:

290
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:16,374
He's saying that.

291
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,584
Every time you turn, you take the covers.
You know that?

292
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,752
Every time you turn, you take it.
You take it.

293
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,288
I'm there and you're sleeping,
but you're dreaming.

294
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,057
'Fuck him.
He doesn't deserve them.'

295
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,993
And you take it and you take it
and you take it.

296
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,196
And you do a billion revolutions a night.
You take it, you take it.

297
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,100
And when you come back, you leave it.
You take it and then leave it over there.

298
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,437
You take it and then leave it.
You're like a shitty fucking typewriter.

299
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,072
You're a typewriting-ass bitch.

300
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,740
And I'm over here with no covers.

301
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,143
A frigid, freezing cold dick
and my mouth is bleeding.

302
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,210
Thank you, bitch."

303
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,555
That's what love is.

304
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,092
Know what love is? This is what love is.

305
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,461
When you're on an airplane
with your girl or whoever

306
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,063
and they're next to you
and you have a thought like:

307
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,399
"Does she really think that the armrest
is for her?

308
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,401
Fucking come on.

309
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,503
It's my turn a little bit sometimes. Fuck.

310
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,606
Come on. You know what?
Put your fucking head

311
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,241
against the side of the plane.

312
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:25,378
I gave you the window seat for a reason.
Use it.

313
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:28,114
Well, I'm trying to be fucking chivalrous.
God.

314
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,688
Time to kick back and relax."

315
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,832
Right? You're freezing,
but she's got your hoodie balled up,

316
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,200
using it as a pillow.

317
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,069
And you gotta be happy about it.

318
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:53,306
You're like,
"Ah, I hope you're comfortable."

319
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,641
And you're, like,
going to visit her family

320
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,410
in, like, Dallas or some shit

321
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,247
and then she was like,
"Do you wanna go because you wanna go...

322
00:18:01,781 --> 00:18:05,518
or do you wanna go
because you know that I want you to go?"

323
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,227
"You know what?
You're asking me to lie to you.

324
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:18,831
I wanna go 'cause I wanna go. How's that?

325
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:22,201
Yeah. I don't even care if you're going
at this point. I am. Uh-huh.

326
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,438
Can we stay with your grandma?
And is she 93 years old?

327
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,807
Can I not understand a word
coming out of her mouth?

328
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,276
And does she only wear nightgowns
even at 3 p.m.?

329
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:33,846
And are her bathrooms weird as shit?
Sign me up."

330
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:37,817
Aw.

331
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,489
Dude, bro, I'll get so mad on the plane.
Like... And I'll fucking...

332
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:46,258
I'll make myself hot.
I'll turn on the a... Fuck that air,

333
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:49,195
the little air-conditioning, the...
The little bitch-ass air.

334
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,498
Make a bigger vent. Make a bigger vent.
It's a hole. Use less material.

335
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,303
You're using more material
to be a big fucking dickhead on purpose.

336
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,272
Make a little... Gotta turn it on.
It's like a fucking titty.

337
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,907
You know what I mean? You turn it on.

338
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,343
It's not even cool air.
It's just loud air.

339
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,214
You turn it on
and it's, like fucking rocketed

340
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,148
in my eye.

341
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,616
Four thousand miles, please.

342
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,585
Just in this circumferenced area.

343
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:13,652
Just in this area.

344
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:17,623
This is where I'm hot, actually.
Right here, I'm freezing already, okay?

345
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,325
But here, I'm tropical.

346
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:23,362
Fucking dry out my contact lens, please.
When I get to the Dallas airport,

347
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:26,298
I wanna walk around like this.
That's how I wanna walk around.

348
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:30,236
I want people to think they see Fetty Wap
in baggage claim. That's what I want.

349
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,571
That's what love is.

350
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:36,742
Walking around the Dallas airport
with three bags and one good eye.

351
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,880
And she's skipping in front of you
with no bags and two eyes.

352
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,216
And you told her to pack one bag.
And you packed one bag,

353
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,719
but somehow you're holding three!

354
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,323
That's not what the man on fire does.

355
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,232
Whatever. So, you know.

356
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,602
I asked her to marry me.

357
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,506
I mean, I didn't mean to...
Well, I meant to.

358
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,409
I meant to... I meant...
I meant to say the words, you know?

359
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:13,245
But... I don't know,
now that I have some retrospect on it,

360
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,881
it's ten years later,
I think the reason why I did it

361
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,751
is because I thought
it was the right thing to do, you know?

362
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,619
It was an idea that I had, right?

363
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,724
Like, my parents are still married.
Now, even. They're my role models, right?

364
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,294
But I didn't mean it when I said it from...
Didn't mean it from the bottom

365
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,360
of my heart, right?

366
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,765
When you ask somebody to marry you,
you gotta fucking mean that shit.

367
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:38,804
You gotta hunker down and just fucking,
you know... "Hey." Right?

368
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:44,376
"Just want you to know...
life can be crazy sometimes.

369
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,580
But you, you make sense of it all."
Or whatever.

370
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:49,806
Whatever Creed song you wanna rip off,
you know? But...

371
00:20:54,887 --> 00:20:58,557
I didn't ask from the bottom of my heart,
you know? I didn't. I just not...

372
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,460
I said it with my mouth.

373
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:05,698
Can't do that. You can't ask somebody
to marry you from your fucking mouth.

374
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,501
Just fire it out there like,
"Meh. You wanna get married?"

375
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,736
You know what I mean?

376
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:12,872
Not like ordering a bagel.

377
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,008
You can order a bagel from your mouth.
Doesn't matter, right?

378
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,477
You can just be like,
"Meh, what bagels you got, sir?

379
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,481
It doesn't matter if I don't like it.
I'll just order another one."

380
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,583
That's not what marriage is, right?

381
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:29,321
To further my point, don't order a bagel
from the bottom of your heart.

382
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:33,058
That'd be very weird. Different feelings,
different situations. Right?

383
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,695
Like, if you walked into a bagel place
and you were, like, fucking,

384
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,329
"Hey.

385
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,833
Excuse me, bagel guy.

386
00:21:41,867 --> 00:21:43,402
I want you to...

387
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,473
I want you to know
your bagels are my everything.

388
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,543
So, can I have an everything bagel?"

389
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,012
Right? Corny, that's my whole point.

390
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:03,355
So, we did it. We got married and I...
But I didn't... I didn't real...

391
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,057
I don't know. I knew something was up.

392
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,993
I didn't know I didn't wanna be married,
but something was up.

393
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,563
I was too young
to realize my own emotions.

394
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,798
Like, I was frustrated, right?
Like, I was...

395
00:22:12,865 --> 00:22:15,668
I'd take it out on wrong things
'cause I didn't know myself.

396
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,871
Like, I'd be eating a sandwich
and be like, "Know what? Fuck turkey."

397
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,840
Or some shit. She'd be, "What's wrong?"

398
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:23,642
I'd be like, "You don't know me!"
I was becoming a dick.

399
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,712
Here's how I knew
I didn't wanna be married.

400
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:30,015
This kept happening. Didn't realize then,
but I realize now, all right?

401
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,685
It's very symbolic.
You know when you live with someone

402
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:34,753
and walk into a room
and they're in the room

403
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,056
and it ends up scaring the shit
out of you, right?

404
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,625
Though it's the one thing
that should be in that room,

405
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,926
'cause it's their room, too,

406
00:22:40,993 --> 00:22:42,995
you're not thinking,
you're doing something else.

407
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:46,031
You walk in and it scares you.
That kept happening, okay?

408
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,500
I kept walking in different rooms
she would be in

409
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:52,104
and getting the shit scared out of me.
I'd walk in and be like, "What the fuck?

410
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,840
Whoa, where did you come from?
How did you get here?"

411
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,976
She'd be like, "I fucking live here."

412
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,712
You're like,
"I know. I get scared because deep down...

413
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:03,382
Deep down I don't want you here. Deep down
I don't want you here." Whatever.

414
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,618
Mistakes are scarier than monsters.

415
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:18,864
That's the other thing, right?
Don't wanna let yourself get scared.

416
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:20,599
Not as a young man, right?

417
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,836
Like, not in your 20s. Don't wanna...
You wanna be the man, right?

418
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,438
Like, for instance,
if somebody scares your friend

419
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:28,440
and they go, "Boo." And he goes:

420
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:33,879
That dude's a bitch, right?
Like, he's not gonna be in your army.

421
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:37,416
I mean, you don't have an army,
but if you did, and some shit went down,

422
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:41,053
you'd give him the flute. And he'd be
the bitch ass in the back... just:

423
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,490
"Don't shoot me. It's not...
I'm just here for morale." Right?

424
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,925
"That's not fair.

425
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,195
That's against the rules.

426
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,431
Shoot the guys with the guns."

427
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,805
On the other hand,
if you scare your friend and you're like:

428
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,741
"Boo." And he's like,
"Come on, motherfucker, let's do this."

429
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,076
Give him a gun.

430
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,079
He should be out there
guarding the flute bitches, right?

431
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,150
I didn't wanna be a flute bitch.
Not in front of my girl.

432
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,687
There's no fucking way I was that secure
in myself. There's no way.

433
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,189
So, I'd walk in
and I'd get scared she was in the room.

434
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,225
But I couldn't let her see that.
So, I'd immediately cover it up

435
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,861
and just get mad at her
for even being in the room.

436
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,964
I'd walk in and just,
"Hey. Ow. What the fuck are you doing?

437
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,934
Look at the way you're sitting
with knees up. You a gargoyle?

438
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,001
Fuck off."

439
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,815
So... now I'm 36.

440
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,950
It's ten years later. I'm a man.

441
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:49,054
Can't fucking do something 'cause I think
it's the right thing to do or it's...

442
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,157
It's what I should do.
Gotta do something so I... 'Cause it's me.

443
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,193
I'm exactly that guy
in that picture I saw.

444
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,662
Thirty-six-year-old fucking...
A man, right?

445
00:24:56,895 --> 00:24:59,832
But I vowed recently
not to pretend anymore because of that.

446
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:03,001
Like... And I've been good at it.
I took a stand recently.

447
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,838
Here's something I don't wanna pretend
to do anymore.

448
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,707
A lot don't agree,
but I don't wanna pretend to wanna go

449
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,943
to your party anymore.
I don't wanna go, okay?

450
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:13,879
I've been to so many parties,
had fun zero times, all right?

451
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,249
Don't wanna go anywhere
where I'm in a conversation

452
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:20,686
and I catch myself going like this: "Ah."
I don't wanna go.

453
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:26,125
People are boring as shit at parties.
They'll just say shit

454
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,660
that they think is interesting,
not giving a shit about you.

455
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,831
I was at a party once and this guy
looked me in the eyes and says this:

456
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,602
"Hey, do you know anything
about front lawns?

457
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,777
'Cause I was thinking
about redoing my front lawn, you know?

458
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:46,678
Might just redo the whole thing."

459
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,115
Ah.

460
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,552
"I'm gonna rip my dick off in the corner.
Yeah. No, it'll hurt,

461
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,789
but at least I'll have to deal
with something else immediately, right?

462
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:59,825
Hey, I'd love to sit and chat
about your fucking lawn,

463
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,228
but... gotta deal
with this dick situation.

464
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,631
It's off."

465
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,338
I don't wanna go to your party.

466
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,207
I don't wanna pretend to wanna go.

467
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:18,310
Here's something I definitely
don't wanna pretend I wanna do.

468
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:21,747
I don't wanna pretend to wanna go
to your fucking birthday party. No.

469
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,782
I don't care. What did you turn, 28?

470
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:25,350
Bye. Do it by yourself. Don't care.

471
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,620
I'm Jehovah's Witness from now on.
For real. I'm not celebrating.

472
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,724
If you're 9, have a birthday party.
That's okay.

473
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,194
But if you're 10, get a job immediately.

474
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,931
That's what I think. You go to work.
And you don't want to.

475
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:42,835
That's the world I wanna live in. That's...
Where 10-year-olds have to go to work.

476
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:46,705
I wanna see them fucking just like,
"Hey, guys. Sorry, I'm late for work."

477
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:51,810
Like... "I only got... Sorry, I only got
this many hours of sleep last night.

478
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:57,683
Hey, guys. First order of business.

479
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:00,686
First order of business.
Need to get these products

480
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,287
to upper management, pronto.

481
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:05,891
Hello, Stacy,
can you please bring in my Capri Sun?

482
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,192
It's going to be a long one.

483
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:12,097
And can you put the straw in the back,
please? I never know how to do that.

484
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:17,769
Hey, guys. Before we get started...
where is the employee bathroom?

485
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,138
I got to go caca now."

486
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,013
If you're 9, have a birthday party.
That's your last one.

487
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:32,417
Okay? My buddy came up to me
this year and he goes like this.

488
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,953
First of all, he's 42, okay? Forty-two.

489
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,656
As in, almost dead.

490
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,290
Okay?

491
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,896
And he comes up to me and he goes
like this, "Hey, man. Guess what."

492
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:49,735
First of all, don't do "guess what" to me,
okay? I'm 36. It's not cute anymore.

493
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,871
What am I supposed to be like? Oh, ah!

494
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,242
"No, don't give me any hints.
I wanna figure it out myself."

495
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,080
It could be anything.

496
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:06,218
If you do "guess what,"
from now on this is my guess. Purple?

497
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:09,421
That's what it is. If it's not purple,
fucking tell me immediately.

498
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,690
Save time. We're both adults. Okay?

499
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:17,162
The guy goes like this,
"Uh, no, not purple. Um...

500
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,400
I'm turning 42 soon.

501
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,002
You gonna come to my birthday party?"

502
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,240
In my heart I'm already like, "Fuck
this guy" for even asking, all right?

503
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:32,010
But in my head, as I'm trying to mull
a polite way to decline the invitation,

504
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:36,214
I realize I'm already going like this
in the guy's face, "No."

505
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:37,883
Right in his face.

506
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,451
"No... " It felt good.

507
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,386
It felt like the real me was coming out.

508
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:43,355
It felt freeing like, "No."

509
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:45,757
It felt like I sang it, for real,
right in his...

00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:50,229

That's such a "fuck you," you know?

530
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,523
It really is.
You want that extra high note.

531
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,059
But some motherfuckers
don't give that shit to you.

532
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:55,460

♪ <i>Meet me somewhere el... ♪</i>

537
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,303
And they're like,
"Fuck you. You don't get that last note."

538
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,105
The balls you've gotta do to do that shit.

539
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,448
I don't wanna go to your party, dude.
What the fuck? Birthday party? Come on.

540
00:30:16,515 --> 00:30:19,251
I gotta get you a gift? Why?
What happened? What? Nothing.

541
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,453
You just waited. That's all that happened.

542
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:25,223
You didn't die. And I gotta, like,
buy you a VCR or some shit?

543
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,827
That's what I get everybody every year
from now on.

544
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:30,962
You're getting a fucking VCR
if you invite me.

545
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,865
"Yeah, did you want that, motherfucker?

546
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,468
I bet you did at one point."

547
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:45,143
Ah, man. Fuck it. That's another thing
I don't wanna pretend to have to do, is...

548
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,547
Is like the gift that you got me
on my birthday. Right?

549
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,117
If you came to my party
and you gave me a gift that I didn't like,

550
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,385
know me better, friend.

551
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,855
That's your fault, right?
'Cause that's about the other person.

552
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,591
Gotta make sure they feel okay
about the gift they got, right?

553
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:03,462
You gotta open it up like, "What? No way.

554
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,298
How did you know
I wanted this specific thing

555
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,435
even though I never said it out loud,
even when I was alone?

556
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:13,338
And also, I don't."

557
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:21,146
Thought about no-gift thing 'cause here's
what happened when I turned 35, okay?

558
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,916
My buddy bought me the gayest gift
you could buy another heterosexual male.

559
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,986
You know what he bought me?
He bought me pants. Yeah.

560
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:31,189
Think about this.
How could you be a grown man

561
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,924
and buy another grown man pants

562
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,660
without seeming like
you suck all the dicks, okay?

563
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,396
Here's the gay part.

564
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,264
They fit fantastic.

565
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:44,469
I don't even know how he knew my size.
I don't even know my own size.

566
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,371
I always have to try pants on.

567
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:49,574
This dude literally eyeballed my hips.

568
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,611
And he was like, "Looks like a 33."

569
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:54,579
And he fucking nailed it, okay?

570
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,448
That's gay.

571
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:58,517
It's gay.

572
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,919
And by the way, that's what I mean.

573
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,254
I mean, it's gay.

574
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,556
I mean, it's gay, all right?

575
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,159
Saying it twice 'cause I wanna clarify.

576
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:09,261
I want you guys to know that I mean it,
okay?

577
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,097
'Cause people get real sensitive
when you use that term.

578
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:14,633
Right? They'll be like,
"You know what? That's not cool

579
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:17,636
to use that word in a derogatory manner."

580
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,305
Yeah, I 100 percent agree with you.

581
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:22,140
I don't mean it in a derogatory way.

582
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:25,577
I mean, it's gay like fucking a guy, okay?

583
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,450
Buying your friends pants that fit
is gay like fucking a guy.

584
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,551
And that's okay.

585
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,153
Fuck guys all day long, yippee.

586
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,955
But it's gay like that, okay?

587
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,958
It's so gay, I think.

588
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,968
I actually think it's gayer
than fucking a guy. I do. I do.

589
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:53,338
I think buying your friend's pants
that fit and wrapping them

590
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:58,109
and waiting to give it to him
is way gayer than just fucking him.

591
00:32:58,176 --> 00:32:59,176
I think that.

592
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,179
I a hundred percent made up my mind.

593
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,181
I've thought about this a lot, obviously.

594
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,183
You can't convince me otherwise.

595
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:09,120
You know why it's gayer
to buy your friend's pants that fit

596
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,557
than it is to fuck him?
Because fucking a guy is easy.

597
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,426
That's why it's less gay.

598
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15,360
It's so easy.

599
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,029
I mean, you could fuck a guy
even if you're not gay.

600
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:22,033
Relax. You don't have to,
but... you could, right?

601
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,304
Like, you can't build a restaurant
if you're not a fucking architect, right?

602
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,039
Like, here, look, let me explain.

603
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,140
Um...

604
00:33:29,207 --> 00:33:32,644
If I held a gun to your head...
Don't need a skill set is what I'm saying.

605
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:35,313
You don't need a skill set
to fuck a guy, right?

606
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,785
If I held a gun to your head and I said,
"Fucking, are you an architect?" And...

607
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:46,191
Okay, wait.
And you were like, "No," right?

608
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,793
And I was like,
"Well, you better build me a restaurant

609
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,630
or I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out."

610
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,167
You'd have to be like,
"Tell my family I love them."

611
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:01,673
But if I held that same gun to your head
and I said, "Are you gay?"

612
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,642
And you were like, "No."

613
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,144
And I said, "Well, you better fuck a guy

614
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,413
or I'm gonna blow
your fucking brains out."

615
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,583
You'd be like, "Where is he?"

616
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,755
That's how easy it is.

617
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:21,092
That's how easy...
That's why it's less gay in my head.

618
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,229
Like, fuck... But, dude,
buying a friend's pants that fit

619
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:28,266
and wrapping them... and knowing the size,
that's not easy. That's difficult.

620
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,401
That takes time.

621
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,802
Gay time, okay?

622
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,172
It's a gay adventure.

623
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,540
It's a gay fucking errand.

624
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,642
There's levels of gayness to it.

625
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:40,378
Like, look.
Look, okay, I'm not gay, all right?

626
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:43,848
Never had sex with a guy even once.

627
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,185
Sounds funny to say it like that.
Still means the same thing. But...

628
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:56,294
However,
sometimes I'm so tired and so lazy

629
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,663
that if somebody came up to me
and they were like:

630
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,666
"Hey, man...
do you wanna buy your friend's pants

631
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:06,304
that fit and wrap them and give them
to him at his party for his birthday...

632
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,573
or...

633
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,448
do you wanna
just, like, fuck this guy right here?"

634
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,450
I might be like:

635
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,221
"I mean, he's right here.

636
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,657
I don't have to go to the car for that."

637
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:30,328
It's so easy and that's why it's less gay.
Dude, it's so easy to fuck a guy.

638
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:33,565
Could practically fuck a guy by mistake.
That's how... Not practically.

639
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,868
You actually could.
It's very unlikely, don't worry. But...

640
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,572
I don't mean the mistake where you're,
"Sorry, I thought it was a woman."

641
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,375
I mean, like, literally a mistake like...

642
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,609
How? Okay, here's how.

643
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:49,748
Um... All right, so...
if you were to walk into a room

644
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,350
with your hard dick already out, okay?

645
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,819
So far, every dude's onboard, right?
Uh...

646
00:35:56,154 --> 00:36:01,359
And... And in the room,
the floor is really slippery, okay?

647
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:08,333
And on the floor
there's one dude face down...

648
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,269
and he's just spreading his asshole.

649
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,239
Even if you slip,
you'll probably catch yourself.

650
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,341
You'll be like,
"Whoa, that was a close one."

651
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,411
But there's a chance you could fall
the other way and be like, "What? No."

652
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,313
Boink. Whoopsie.
You fucked him by mistake, okay?

653
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:30,689
But there is no way in hell
that you can slip and fall

654
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,957
and buy your friend's pants that fit.

655
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:38,196
No matter how wet Macy's is,
it just can't happen.

656
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,598
It's impossible. It won't happen.

657
00:36:47,272 --> 00:36:49,908
You can't. You can't be like,
"Whoa, hey, wait a minute.

658
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:51,376
Those are cool pants.

659
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:53,678
Do you have them in a size 33?

660
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,547
Oh, I'll take them. Thanks.

661
00:36:55,613 --> 00:36:58,717
Hopefully I slip all the way over
to your Gift Wrapping Department."

662
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,462
So, the pants fit good, you know?
And, uh...

663
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,566
But here's what happened.
So, my buddy called me, uh...

664
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:17,602
who bought me the pants,
he called me two weeks after.

665
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20,972
And he called me up and was like,
"Hey, man, wanna get a cup of coffee?"

666
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,342
And I was like, "Fuck, yeah,
I'll drink that shit right now, player.

667
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,846
I'm a G about my coffee.
I don't give a fuck, man.

668
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:31,416
Put your fucking caffeine
where your mouth is, coz."

669
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,422
So, I went
to go meet him for coffee, right?

670
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,391
And as soon as I hung up the phone,
I left my house.

671
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,861
As soon as I got to my own door,
I realized I wasn't...

672
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,330
I wasn't wearing the pants that he got me,
okay?

673
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:48,833
I didn't want the first time for him
to see me since he got me the pants

674
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,803
to show up and not be wearing the pants,
right?

675
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:55,907
'Cause then he would spot me and be like,
"Hey, what's up? Aw."

676
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:57,942
And then that made me be like:

677
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:01,379
So, I changed pants.

678
00:38:01,446 --> 00:38:04,015
I literally put on a cuter outfit
to meet a dude, okay?

679
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,484
That's gay as shit. So...

680
00:38:08,686 --> 00:38:12,791
Now I got the pants on
and, um, I show up to the coffee shop

681
00:38:12,857 --> 00:38:16,494
and I see him and he sees me
and he goes like this, "Hey, what's up?"

682
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,662
Oh!

683
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,797
And that made me go:

684
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,666
Fuck this asshole.

685
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,035
He's controlling my life with pants.

686
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,837
It's pants control.

687
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:31,709
So, now I'm uncomfortable. I'm like,
"Let's just get this over with," right?

688
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,813
So, we get the coffee, uh,
we walk out to the patio.

689
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,882
I'm with the dude who bought me the pants.
I'm wearing the pants.

690
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,684
We're having a conversation, coffee.

691
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:43,354
And as we're doing this,
a girl walks out of the coffee shop

692
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,090
and she spots me and she actually says:

693
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,460
"You know what?
Those are some really cool pants."

694
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:54,098
I'm like, "Oh, cool." At least
I get to talk to a girl about it, right?

695
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:57,435
My buddy leans in and says,
"You know, I bought them for him."

696
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,507
That's way gayer than just fucking him.

697
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,349
That's what happens when you pretend.
That's what happens. Right?

698
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:13,818
You get in a situation
you're not prepared to deal with

699
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:16,020
'cause you're not being you.
That's what I did.

700
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:19,591
When he bought me pants and I opened them,
I should've said how I felt.

701
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,527
I should've been like, "How did you know
my size, you fucking weirdo?"

702
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:27,498
Instead I was like, "Oh, cool pants.
I'll wear them next time I see you."

703
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:31,035
I played the game
and then the game played me.

704
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,642
Yup. But it's hard, though, it is.
It's hard to not pretend.

705
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,078
It's hard to know who you are
in any given situation

706
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,813
and not pretend ever, right?

707
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,449
Like, we all do it.
We all pretend in moments.

708
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,018
We all think we matter more
than we actually do. Right?

709
00:39:47,085 --> 00:39:49,721
We all think we're special,
but we're not. Right?

710
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,891
You know the worst people nowadays
that think they matter more

711
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,893
than they actually matter, hands-down?

712
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:57,428
People that work out
and won't shut the fuck up about it.

713
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:58,830
I cannot stand that shit.

714
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,700
Bang, bang, bang, click, click. Reload.
Bang, bang, bang, I can't stand it.

715
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,104
Work out, go home.
You don't matter that much, okay?

716
00:40:06,938 --> 00:40:09,807
All this inspirational culture
that's going around,

717
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,011
this fitspo lifestyle
that they're trying to convince you of.

718
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,780
Who are you inspiring?
That's what I want to know. Right?

719
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,017
These dudes will be like, "You know what?
I used to weigh 90 pounds,

720
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:23,721
but now, through hard work, determination,
perseverance, never backing down,

721
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:26,991
not stopping, remaining focused,
never veering off track,

722
00:40:27,058 --> 00:40:32,697
not looking over my shoulder, never dying,
no days off,

723
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:35,833
now, I got bigger muscles." Okay.

724
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,437
You know what? Eat dicks. Okay?

725
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,573
Eat all the dicks you see around.

726
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:45,743
If you're like that, if you see a dick,
you eat that shit.

727
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,170
Like that.

728
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,947
Like a log trimmer, just:

729
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,228
With dick chips
spinning out of your mouth:

730
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,021
Throw a dick up
and just swallow it whole.

731
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,924
Where there's a dick outline in your neck,
muscle it down.

732
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,493
That's your new workout, okay?
Eat dicks, of course.

733
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,500
Like, you're not really doing much, okay?

734
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:13,104
Who the fuck are you inspiring?
You're not running for political office.

735
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:14,939
You're not joining the Army.

736
00:41:15,006 --> 00:41:18,509
All you do is move weight around
and eat extra chicken, right?

737
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:23,247
You like protein? Cool.
There's protein in my dick. Eat it.

738
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,486
You work hard?
Congratu-the fuck-lations.

739
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:29,487
I work hard, too.

740
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,956
I don't hashtag it "blessed" all day long.

741
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:33,958
Eat my dick.

742
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,730
These guys are so self-involved.
It's so fucking annoying.

743
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,600
They're ridiculous. They'll take a selfie
in the mirror and be like:

744
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:44,902
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

745
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:51,209
No. Not really, man. You know why?
You're not a warrior. That's why. Okay?

746
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,512
You just, like, have a job
at the movie theater or some shit.

747
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,749
Keep your friends real close.
See movies with them. It works out fine.

748
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,717
You don't rule the nation.

749
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,891
Fucking, they're ridiculous, these guys.

750
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:10,261
They're just ridiculous.
"You know, I... Well, I've... Hey.

751
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,632
Just so you know...
life is a journey, okay?

752
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,301
It's not about the destination.

753
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:22,874
It's about the tools you use...
and the path you take."

754
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:28,046
Oh, really? I didn't know I was dealing
with the Dalai fucking Lama, dude.

755
00:42:32,784 --> 00:42:34,285
"You know, don't be afraid to...

756
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,156
Don't ever be afraid
to reach your dreams."

757
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,891
Oh, cool, man.

758
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:44,262
"Don't ever fucking be afraid
to make your dreams a reality...

759
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:46,564
and succeed, you know?

760
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:52,170
I used to be a shell of a man, but now...

761
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:57,041
Now I know exactly
what's inside that shell.

762
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,179
All equal parts that make me me.

763
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,115
Don't ever be afraid of being you."

764
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:07,885
You know what my favorite one is?
"Just be you. Everyone else is taken."

765
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,253
Fuck that shit.

766
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:17,862
"Hard work, determination, perseverance,
never backing down, not stopping,

767
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,998
remaining focused, never quitting,
fighting the desire,

768
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:24,235
but also following the desire,
never looking over your shoulder,

769
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:27,171
fucking, army of one, no days off.

770
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:29,207
Rome wasn't built in a day.

771
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:34,045
Buildings, robots, carpet, iPa... "
You're just saying words, okay?

772
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,048
You like words? Here's more. Eat my dick.
There's three.

773
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,393
Like, who the fuck are you inspiring?
That's what I wanna know. I wanna...

774
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:54,198
That's what I wanna know.
I wanna know what guy sees that guy...

775
00:43:54,866 --> 00:43:56,767
and then gets inspired.

776
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,707
Right? Like, what guy sees a poster
with, like, a whale's tail

777
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:06,644
breaching out of the ocean
and the word "perseverance" under it?

778
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,981
Hmm.

779
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:22,326
Let's think hard about that.

780
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,066
What guy sees a bunch of birds
lined up on a tree branch

781
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,736
and thinks "teamwork"?

782
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:37,375
Like, what guy scrolls through
that Instagram post and is like:

783
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,377
Whoa.

784
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:43,781
You ever think about that?
You ever think about perseverance?

785
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,918
You ever think about that?
You ever think about taking no days off?

786
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:50,922
You ever think about how you could do more
if you didn't take any days off?

787
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:54,859
Ever think about how you're an army of 1?
'Cause you're not more than other people?

788
00:44:54,926 --> 00:44:58,062
You ever think about how Rome
wasn't built in a day?

789
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:01,766
You ever think about
maybe it took a few days to build Rome?

790
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,303
Nobody. You're not...
You're not inspiring anybody.

791
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,038
You know why? You know how I know?

792
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,839
'Cause never in the history of man

793
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:11,709
has any dude looked
at another guy's fit body and been like:

794
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:14,979
"Wow, that guy's in shape.
I'm gonna create Microsoft."

795
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:16,781
That's never fucking happened, okay?

796
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,082
So, eat dicks.

797
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:27,191
See, that's what happens.
That's what happens when you lie to kids.

798
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,963
That's what happens.
When you look at kids and you say:

799
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:33,998
"You can do anything
you put your mind to."

800
00:45:34,999 --> 00:45:37,501
You get the motherfucker
that grows up and believes that.

801
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:39,870
He's like,
"Fucking time to change the world.

802
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:40,937
Here we go.

803
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:45,209
Ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta.

804
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,247
Let's cure world hunger. Let's try
to cure world hunger. Here we go.

805
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,821
Less people hungry yet?"

806
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:00,291
Don't lie to kids.

807
00:46:00,825 --> 00:46:03,861
Right? I mean, I don't know.
That's how I feel, though. Fuck that.

808
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,196
I don't have any kids yet,

809
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,865
but when I have my first kid
and that dude comes out,

810
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:11,268
no way I'm saying, "You can do anything
you put your mind to." No way.

811
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,838
Gonna look him in the eyes.
First thing I say is:

812
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,773
"You're gonna fail a lot. Aah!"
And run away.

813
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,043
"Life's full of hardships, buddy.

814
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:23,848
Your first hardship is try and find me."
Pyoom! And just fucking...

815
00:46:30,421 --> 00:46:32,823
Fucking, pyoom, so fast that papers

816
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,959
are floating to the ground
like in the cartoons.

817
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,228
I arrive at my next destination like:

818
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:50,841
What do I know? I'm saying
don't lie to kids. I have zero kids.

819
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,210
I have zero boys, zero girls.
That equals zero.

820
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:59,083
I've been thinking about it,
why I don't have kids... you know, yet.

821
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,919
And I think, really, honestly,
the answer is

822
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,322
if I'm being honest like I said I would,
I wouldn't pretend, and...

823
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,392
But more importantly,
if I'm being honest and not pretending

824
00:47:08,893 --> 00:47:12,563
the reason why I don't have kids yet
is because I'm scared,

825
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:16,367
but more importantly,
it's because I'm selfish, man. For real.

826
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,569
Like, I mean, but that's the thing.

827
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,105
You could be who you want
when you don't have kids.

828
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:22,940
It doesn't matter that much, right?

829
00:47:23,074 --> 00:47:27,445
Like, if you have a kid looking up at you
that... As a role model,

830
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:30,147
you gotta fucking take charge and do shit,
right?

831
00:47:30,481 --> 00:47:31,482
But I don't have to.

832
00:47:31,549 --> 00:47:35,419
Like, a lot of you guys fucking have kids
at home, right? And you left them.

833
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,255
You were like, "Bye, guys.
We'll be back later," you know?

834
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:42,426
And they were like, "Okay, can't wait
to see you when you get back." Right?

835
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:46,363
You're thinking about them when
you're laughing. You're like: "Ha, ha."

836
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,899
In your head you're like,
"I have a kid," you know?

837
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:50,901
That doesn't leave you.

838
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,171
For me, I'm selfish as shit.
I leave the house,

839
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,006
I don't fucking have to tell anybody.

840
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,551
Sometimes I pretend. I'm like,

841
00:47:57,575 --> 00:48:00,277
"Bye, guys, see you later.
Ha, ha. You don't exist." I leave.

842
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,484
Having kids changes who you are.

843
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,495
It doesn't mean it changes who you are
for the worse.

844
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,889
It changes who you are for the better.
But still, fuck that shit.

845
00:48:12,323 --> 00:48:14,191
I don't wanna be better. I wanna be me.

846
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:18,195
You can do... Be whatever you want.
In my heart, honestly,

847
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,598
I'm fucking cold sometimes,
and it's okay.

848
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:22,533
Bad mood? I don't have to watch myself

849
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,035
'cause I don't have a kid
looking up at me, right?

850
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:28,205
It doesn't matter. I could be looking
at the guy at the gym.

851
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,507
"You don't matter that much.

852
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,476
And fucking, no, I won't come
to your 42nd birthday party."

853
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,913
In my heart,
I'm gangster as shit sometimes.

854
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,482
Sometimes I look outside of my house
in my neighborhood

855
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,217
and I think, in this voice:

856
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,553
"You know what?
The streets is real out here."

857
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,056
And I know it to be true in my heart,
okay?

858
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:49,293
If I had a little kid looking up at me
every single day,

859
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,095
that would change who I was.

860
00:48:51,162 --> 00:48:53,497
Just like, "Hey, Dad,
what are we going to do today?"

861
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:57,201
"Yo, man, why you looking at me
with them angel eyes, player?

862
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,203
Trying to keep the streets real.

863
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:01,305
And you're softening a motherfucker up,
dawg.

864
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,541
Fuck y'all, man.

865
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:06,177
Making me emotional.
Go to your room, player. Now.

866
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:09,346
Fucking hard as shit up in this bitch."

867
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,553
Having kids changes who you are,
for the better. Fuck it.

868
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:20,524
It happened to my buddy. He used
to be my best friend. Now he's a dad.

869
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,429
That's how selfish I am.
I can't even have a best friend dad.

870
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,598
I can't.
I get jealous of the kid for real.

871
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:30,401
I'll be like, "You've known me
for nine years. She's 4.

872
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,102
How do you explain your loyalty?"

873
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:41,045
He'll be, "I took her to the park."
I'll be, "You never took me to the park."

874
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,683
"I would... I would have driven you, so...

875
00:49:47,218 --> 00:49:49,453
It's interesting. It's really interesting.
Really.

876
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:52,056
I'm not mad, I just... I'm interested.
I'm not mad."

877
00:49:57,561 --> 00:49:59,530
Yeah, man,
he had this fucking little girl.

878
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:01,732
This little daughter girl.
This little fucking...

879
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,503
She's 4 years old. They live in Texas,
so, I haven't met them yet. Right?

880
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,340
Met them recently,
but not when he called me up 'cause he...

881
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,376
I live in L.A. He called me and was like,
"Hey, enough's enough.

882
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:15,279
I want you to meet my baby girl.
She's 4 already and...

883
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:18,182
We're coming out to L.A.
Are there hotels we could stay at?"

884
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:21,118
And I just spoke immediately.
I said, "No, stay at the house."

885
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:23,020
I didn't even mean it. I just said it

886
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,756
'cause, like, I heard my dad say it
once growing up, you know?

887
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,524
You're like, "I'm an adult now."

888
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:30,027
I even heard my dad's
East Coast accent come out.

889
00:50:30,094 --> 00:50:32,005
I was like,
"Yeah, guys, come on over."

890
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,069
It was like a fucking
Olive Garden commercial or something.

891
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:37,644
"Yeah, when
you're here, you're family. Come on over.

892
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,537
There's unlimited breadsticks
at the house."

893
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:48,212
And they came over
and that fucking... That...

894
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:51,615
I mean, that little girl was directly
trying to affect how real I keep it

895
00:50:51,682 --> 00:50:53,083
on these streets, you know?

896
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:57,121
She was looking at me
all cute and soft and shit.

897
00:50:57,187 --> 00:51:00,124
First of all, her name is Anika,
which is like, that's so cute.

898
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,258
Fuck that, right?

899
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,795
I'm like, "How am I supposed
to keep it real and call this girl Anika?

900
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,165
Fuck that. I'm gonna call her Rachel.
That's a regular-ass name."

901
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,770
But you can't call a 4-year-old girl
a different name.

902
00:51:12,836 --> 00:51:14,672
That would fuck her up for life.

903
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:18,542
Imagine her talking to her dad later on
just like, "Hey, Dad, excuse me.

904
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,844
I have a question for you.
Hey, Dad, excuse me.

905
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:24,782
Can I talk to you for a second?
Hey, Dad, can I talk to you for a second?

906
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:29,186
Hey, Dad, how come your friend that looks
like the guy from <i>Sleepy Hollow,</i>

907
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:30,253
why does he...?

908
00:51:32,156 --> 00:51:35,125
Dad, excuse me.
Can I talk to you for a second? Hey, Dad."

909
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:38,629
Why do little girls grab their pussies
from behind? That's so weird.

910
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:41,131
Don't go weird like I made them do it.

911
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,435
That was Jesus Christ our Lord and savior
that made them do that, okay?

912
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:47,571
If he did anything, he did everything,
including that, all right?

913
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:50,240
He did it, like, on the eighth day
or some shit.

914
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:54,611
"And on the eighth day, little girls
will grab their pussies from behind."

915
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:58,215
And even... And even the disciples
were like, "Whoa, already?

916
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,119
Like, we can do that later." He was like,
"It's what I thought of now. No order.

917
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:03,320
We'll get them all done."

918
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,493
And then he made lakes or whatever.
"Hey, Dad. Excuse me, Dad.

919
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:13,364
I have a question for you. Hey, Dad.
Can't you see I have a question for you?

920
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:15,842
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can you be done with that right now?

921
00:52:15,866 --> 00:52:19,470
Hey, Dad. How come your friend
that looks like a cool, young Bob Saget,

922
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,536
why does he...?

923
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,907
And he knows it. Why does he...?

924
00:52:25,209 --> 00:52:27,878
And he hates when people say that
on Twitter. Why does he...?

925
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:32,716
Why does he call me Rachel?

926
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:35,586
My name is Anika.

927
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:37,855
Am I Rachel, too?

928
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:41,158
I want to buy a bunny and then kill it.

929
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,330
Anika loves bunnies, but Rachel doesn't."

930
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,799
You know what I mean?
That's how that probably happens.

931
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:52,736
So... Thank you.

932
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:57,174
So, now I gotta call this girl Anika
against my better gangster judgment.

933
00:53:01,612 --> 00:53:02,780
They showed up, man.

934
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,183
They showed up and stayed with me.
'Cause I invited them.

935
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,251
That's how that works.

936
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:09,720
And they showed up.

937
00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:15,426
And when they showed up, uh, my buddy,
or Ryan, the dad, my ex-best friend,

938
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,560
he walked in first.

939
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:19,830
And this is how.

940
00:53:19,897 --> 00:53:22,599
He walked into my property
and he's walking in like thi...

941
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:25,803
This is just how he walks in.
He goes like this: "Hey, man."

942
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:33,243
I'm like, "What the fuck?
Is a magic show about to start?"

943
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,945
I have no idea what's going on, right?

944
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,915
But then I realize very quickly
that he's doing it like that

945
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,517
'cause little Anika
is hiding behind his leg

946
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:44,321
and he's playing the dad part
and he asks... He's asking me...

947
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:48,992
He asks me, he says, "Hey, man.
By the way, have you seen Anika?"

948
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,635
And I'm like, "This motherfucker.
Are you serious right now?

949
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:02,439
You and I both know where that bitch is.
Come on, dawg.

950
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:06,944
I'm trying to keep this shit real, man.
Don't make me eat your bullshit dad life.

951
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,278
Fuck y'all, man."

952
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,650
Didn't give a shit how real
I tried to keep it.

953
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:15,886
He just tried to out-dad my realness.

954
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,622
He just did it harder.
He was like, "Fucking, come on."

955
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,832
And I'm stuck.
I'm like, "Fuck, man. Come on, dawg.

956
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:31,502
This your life, motherfucker.

957
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,481
I've been looking around for her all day,
dawg."

958
00:54:47,518 --> 00:54:49,820
That's when she goes like this:
"Here I am."

959
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:52,789
I'm like, "I knew where you were, bitch!

960
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:57,494
You're not... You're holding on to his leg.
I can see your little fucking baby hands.

961
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,863
Disrespecting the hiding game
on my property."

962
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,636
I'm back to pretending.
I'm pretending again.

963
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,672
Thirty-six, pretending I don't know
where this little girl is.

964
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:11,074
I'm okay with calling her Anika, right?

965
00:55:11,441 --> 00:55:13,010
They stay with me for a week.

966
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,313
You know how shit in life shapes you
and it changes you

967
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:19,683
and makes you who you are, right?
When you're a kid, you get a bunch of...

968
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,319
When you're Anika's age,
you got a bunch of moments

969
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,321
that shape you and make you who you are.

970
00:55:24,388 --> 00:55:27,457
When you're an adult, don't happen much
'cause you are who you are.

971
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:31,695
But they do happen, right? Maybe
I've had four or five in my adult life.

972
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:36,567
I had one while they were staying with me
at the end that fucked me up, all right?

973
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:41,371
It was where... It made me realize
that, you know, I'm not Denzel

974
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:42,906
and I'm not the man on fire.

975
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,945
Life isn't my movie and maybe that's okay,
all right? So, here's what happened.

976
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:55,118
I was, uh... I was on my couch watching
my TV in my TV room in my house.

977
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:58,555
I was watching this show I like to watch,
which is <i>The First 48</i>, okay?

978
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:00,490
If you haven't seen the show,
it's graphic.

979
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:04,461
It, like, shows dead bodies and families
crying over loss of loved ones.

980
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,897
And it's confirming in my heart,
you know what?

981
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:09,032
The streets must be real out there.

982
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:11,935
I knew that shit all along, player.

983
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,840
So, I'm watching the show
and I'm watching the show

984
00:56:16,907 --> 00:56:18,875
'cause it's what the fuck I wanna do,
okay?

985
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:22,379
Now, as I'm watching it, little Anika
walks down the stairs, all right?

986
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,948
Now, as I see her,
my adult brain kicks in.

987
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:27,451
The same brain that invited them over,
all right?

988
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:31,488
I was like, "You gotta change the channel.
You can't let her eyes see this

989
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,690
because she'll grow up
and kill bunnies, right?"

990
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:36,893
So... I was like, "Good idea.
You gotta change the channel.

991
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,863
So, I went to grab the remote.
As soon as I grabbed the remote,

992
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:43,667
my gangster side kicked in and I thought,
"You fucking mark-ass bitch.

993
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,136
You going to let this ho run your life?

994
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,872
Fuck that, man.
You're too real for this shit.

995
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:52,175
She's gonna change you
just like she did her father before you."

996
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:55,879
So, then I was like, "All right, I guess
she gonna learn about life tonight."

997
00:56:57,781 --> 00:57:00,517
So, I'm watching this show,
doing what the fuck I wanna do

998
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:03,987
and little Anika's gotta do it, too,
'cause it's what I wanna do, all right?

999
00:57:04,488 --> 00:57:05,989
Now, about 20 seconds goes by

1000
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,526
and I realize that, you know,
she doesn't really care what's going on

1001
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,629
'cause there's no cartoons, right?
So, I feel her kind of give up.

1002
00:57:12,696 --> 00:57:14,965
And she looks over at me
and she goes like this:

1003
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,599
"Hey, Chris."

1004
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:23,140
I'm like, "Fuck, I didn't know
there was gonna be dialogue in this shit."

1005
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:27,110
So, I turned over, I said,
"Yeah, what the fuck you want?"

1006
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:29,680
That's how I sound in my head.

1007
00:57:29,746 --> 00:57:32,783
I probably said something like,
"Yes, sweetheart, how can I help you?"

1008
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:40,724
So, she looks at me and goes like this,
"Well, um, I was wondering something."

1009
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,894
Like, "Yeah, get on with that shit."

1010
00:57:44,661 --> 00:57:46,563
She goes like this, "Well."

1011
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,699
She did that quick breath thing
that kids do.

1012
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:51,601
I don't know why they do that,
but like, "Hey. Sorry.

1013
00:57:51,668 --> 00:57:53,603
I don't know
how to do all of the stuffs yet.

1014
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:58,208
I'm not in control of my faculties total
at this point."

1015
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,982
So, she looks at me
and this is what she says.

1016
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:10,253
She says, "Well, I was wondering, um...
do you want to see a secret garden?"

1017
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,530
At this point, my adult brain and my
gangster are confused as shit, okay?

1018
00:58:20,864 --> 00:58:22,866
I looked at her, I said, "Yo, what?"

1019
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,802
She repeated herself
like I was the fucking asshole

1020
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,004
in this conversation.

1021
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:32,976
She said, "I said...
do you want to see a secret garden?"

1022
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:36,113
And, you know, I mean, like,
yeah, kind of, you know?

1023
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:38,682
Probably not a secret garden
she's gonna show,

1024
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:41,284
but on the off chance she's right,
what is it like, right?

1025
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,954
Are there dragons there,
flowers with dicks on them?

1026
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:46,857
Whatever there are,
I wanna Facebook about it, okay?

1027
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:48,725
So, I'm curious now.

1028
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:50,961
So, I grab the remote and I pause my show.

1029
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:53,964
And I look at her and I say,
"Okay, show me the secret garden."

1030
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,766
And she got so fucking excited.

1031
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,635
She goes like this,
"Okay. Come on, follow me."

1032
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,604
And she starts walking around like this,

1033
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,673
like some shitty
underwater explorer, okay?

1034
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,676
And I follow her. I catch myself
doing the same fucking thing.

1035
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:10,147
I'm walking around my own house
like, hey, anything could pop up

1036
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,882
around any one of these corners.

1037
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:14,684
No, it can't. It's my house.
I put everything in it, okay?

1038
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:21,191
So, now, she leads me
through the kitchen twice. Okay?

1039
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:25,228
Yeah, and I'm like, "Yo, does she know
where the secret garden is or what?"

1040
00:59:26,797 --> 00:59:29,866
So, I casually mention to her, I was like,
"You know, uh...

1041
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:35,005
we went through the kitchen two times.
So, like, what's the deal with that?

1042
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:37,574
You know where this shit is or what?"

1043
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:41,912
Again, like I'm the asshole she responded.
She says, "I know that, okay?

1044
00:59:43,113 --> 00:59:47,017
We had to do that 'cause that's how
you open up the portal to get there."

1045
00:59:48,118 --> 00:59:50,620
I have no idea.
I'm like, "You just take the wheel."

1046
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,622
No idea what's going on. I mentioned...

1047
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:55,025
I was like,
"Is there maybe a quicker way to go

1048
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,359
because my show's still on."

1049
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:59,629
And she goes like this,
"Okay, come on, let's take the shortcut."

1050
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:06,369
I didn't say it, but I definitely thought,
next time start with the fucking shortcut.

1051
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:12,209
So, she leads me outside to my backyard
and she goes like this, "Here it is."

1052
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,612
"No, no. This isn't a secret at all.

1053
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:18,782
I've known about this place
since I bought it. It's my own backyard.

1054
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,183
I've had it for three years.

1055
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,319
My dogs shit here.
They know about it, too."

1056
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,287
I thought she was gonna change
who I was.

1057
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,323
Instead, I checked into my gangster heart.

1058
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:30,026
I looked in her eyes and I thought,
"Just another lying-ass bitch.

1059
01:00:33,897 --> 01:00:35,765
I've been down this road before.

1060
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,268
Betrayal is a motherfucker.

1061
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:42,739
That's how you got so real
in the first place, dawg."

1062
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,009
So, I looked at her and I went,
"Fucking peace."

1063
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,246
And I pivoted
and I walked back to my house.

1064
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:53,049
I took about three or four steps
and that's when I heard, "Hey, Chris."

1065
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,953
I'm like, "Oh, shit.
She got more heat for that ass, huh?

1066
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,157
Fuck that. She ain't changing nothing.
You're still real as fuck.

1067
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:01,658
See what the hell she want."

1068
01:01:01,725 --> 01:01:04,394
So, I turn around and say,
"Yeah? What the fuck you want now?"

1069
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:09,099
And this time she's pointing and she says,
"Hey, look, there's an orange tree."

1070
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,935
And I looked and there was an orange tree.

1071
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,371
I have an orange tree.
I didn't know that, okay?

1072
01:01:16,106 --> 01:01:18,975
That's a secret, but still, fuck her.
She didn't know, right?

1073
01:01:21,077 --> 01:01:23,213
I was surprised. I was like,
"Shit. How you...?

1074
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,316
Oh, my God, you brought this
like you brought this shit with you."

1075
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,119
But I played it cool.
I was like, "All right, yeah.

1076
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:32,155
Thanks for showing me that shit
that I 100 percent already knew

1077
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:35,192
that I definitely without a doubt
already had.

1078
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:37,927
Peace."

1079
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,063
So, I took a few steps back to my house.

1080
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,799
And that's when I heard in the background,
"Hey, Chris."

1081
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,369
"Like, she really trying
to change a motherfucker. Fuck that.

1082
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:48,071
She ain't changing nothing. You...

1083
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:51,107
Well, you do now have an orange tree
that you didn't know about.

1084
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,710
But that don't change
who you are on the inside.

1085
01:01:53,777 --> 01:01:55,745
Now, basically, you're still the same you.

1086
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:58,915
Only you can enjoy a delicious orange
whenever you so choose.

1087
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:00,850
Yeah, player.

1088
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,152
Good logic.

1089
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:04,054
See what the fuck she want now."

1090
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:07,924
So, I turn around real as fuck and I say,
"Yeah? What the fuck you want now?"

1091
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,961
She's still pointing, not wavering at all,
being a kid,

1092
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:14,130
and she says,
"Well, um, do you want to pick one?"

1093
01:02:15,131 --> 01:02:18,301
And I'm like, "Man, I don't give a fuck
about this whole situation,

1094
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:24,908
but... I am taller than you
and... logistically, it does make sense."

1095
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,879
So, I grabbed the orange like a boss
and I handed it to her.

1096
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:33,116
And in my head I thought, "Don't ever say
I never did nothing for you.

1097
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,219
A favor for a favor.
That's the code of the streets.

1098
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:37,286
You hear me?

1099
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:41,291
One day, and it may not be tomorrow,
I may come knocking on your door

1100
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:46,062
and ask you for, like, a banana
or some shit. Anyway... bye."

1101
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:48,965
I pivot.
I take a few steps back to my house.

1102
01:02:49,032 --> 01:02:51,901
And that's when I hear
in the background again, "Hey, Chris."

1103
01:02:52,135 --> 01:02:54,537
Like, "She really sinking her hooks in,
man. Fuck that.

1104
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:57,307
You're real. Take them hooks out.
Show her what's up."

1105
01:02:57,374 --> 01:03:00,477
So, I turned around and said,
"Yeah, what the fuck you want now?"

1106
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:02,946
She's still standing there,
not wavering at all.

1107
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:05,815
Not caring how real I'm trying to keep it,
just being a kid.

1108
01:03:05,882 --> 01:03:09,419
And she says, "Well, um, do you
want to pick one for yourself?"

1109
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:10,387
Aw.

1110
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,489
No, don't go "aw," fuck this bitch.

1111
01:03:13,423 --> 01:03:16,226
She's changing you
and she's not even really here right now.

1112
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:20,397
Know how hard it was to keep streets real
while looking at her fucking angel eyes?

1113
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:26,336
But I did want one.
I mean, they looked so fucking good.

1114
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,409
So, I was like, "Man, you know what?
Let's strike a deal, man.

1115
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,844
You could eat that shit
and pick that orange

1116
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:37,180
as long as you do it
while you're keeping it real

1117
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:40,050
and you eat it
while you're watching <i>The First 48.</i>

1118
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:42,552
Yeah, player. Good logic."

1119
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:43,853
So, I grabbed it.

1120
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,221
And she was being so cute

1121
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:48,291
that, like, she was really starting
to make me fucking emotional.

1122
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:51,594
I went... I went, "Bye." I barely looked
at her. I went, "Okay, bye."

1123
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:53,897
And I pivoted and I walked back quickly.

1124
01:03:53,963 --> 01:03:57,367
As soon as I touched the doorknob
of my door, I hear in the background:

1125
01:03:57,434 --> 01:03:59,302
"Hey, Chris."

1126
01:03:59,369 --> 01:04:02,138
And I'm running on empty.
I got no gas left in the tank.

1127
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,908
I take my last breath,
I turn around and I say:

1128
01:04:04,974 --> 01:04:06,509
"Yeah, what the fuck you want now?"

1129
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:09,312
And she knew she had me.
She was even cuter at this point.

1130
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:11,414
She was smaller, her eyes got bigger.

1131
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:13,350
Someone did her hair in the meantime.

1132
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:17,887
And she looks at me, no bullshit,
and she actually says:

1133
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:22,425
"Well, I was wondering, um,
do you want to come to my birthday party?"

1134
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:50,553
Yo, is this off or what?

1135
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:51,954
It is, right?

1136
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,124
Whoa, you've got to fix this shit.

1137
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,359
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Are we good?

1138
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,261
- What?
- I said, sorry.

1139
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:00,329
You did this shit?

1140
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,099
What, are you fucking telepathic?

1141
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:08,505
Starts cutting out and shit
like an M. Night Shyamalan movie or shit.

1142
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:09,906
Oh, fuck.

1143
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:14,309
"I'm sorry."

1144
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,514
It's fucking... You guys fucking apologize
over everything.

1145
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:25,321
Literally...
Literally had nothing to do with it.

1146
01:05:25,388 --> 01:05:26,388
"I'm sorry."

1147
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:30,960
"Was that you?" "No, but, you know,
the universe. I'm in it."
