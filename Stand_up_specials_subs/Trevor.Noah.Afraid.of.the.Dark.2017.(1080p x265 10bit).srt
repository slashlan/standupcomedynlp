1
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,076
Wow.

2
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,578
Wow.

3
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,122
Oh, wow.

4
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,832
What's happening, New York?

5
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:43,794
Yeah!

6
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,547
Oh, this is amazing.
Thank you for coming out.

7
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:50,592
We're gonna have fun tonight.

8
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,886
Welcome to it, people.

9
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,514
This is us. Can I tell you for a second?

10
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,392
This has been my dream
since I started stand-up comedy,

11
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,769
doing a special in New York City.

12
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,020
This is it!

13
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,775
This is it. New York, New York!

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,153
Yeah! New York!

15
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,240
I'm walking over here!

16
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,202
That was all I thought New York was
before I came here.

17
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:19,871
I just thought it was a city of people
almost getting run over.

18
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,293
Just everyone walking into the street,
a taxi rolling up, slamming the hood,

19
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,503
"I'm walking over here!

20
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,963
What's wrong with you?

21
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,840
You want some coffee?"

22
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:33,302
I don't even know what that meant.

23
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,097
All I knew was one day,
I was gonna go to New York City.

24
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,434
And I, too, was going to almost
get run over by a car.

25
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,314
I had a dream and I set out.
And it's a lot harder than it seems.

26
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,857
In the movies, they make it look simple.

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,942
They make it look like you run out,
the car almost hits you,

28
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,945
you do that thing-- "Hey!"
Slam the hood and then move on.

29
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,364
But it's not that easy.
It's all about timing.

30
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,368
It's all about timing.
It's all about being precise.

31
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,787
You have to get out at the exact same time
that the taxi is there,

32
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,539
so it stops, so you can hit the hood.

33
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:06,043
If you don't have the guts
and you come out too late, the car's gone.

34
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,544
It's a waste of everyone's time.

35
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,921
You just look like a mad person now.
You're just like...

36
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:12,215
"Hey!

37
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:15,344
I'm walking over here!"

38
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,806
If you come out at the exact time
as the car,

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,808
then you just get run over.
That's just pointless.

40
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:24,102
You know, it's like, "Hey--"

41
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:28,982
"Hey, he was walking over here.

42
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,401
What's wrong with you?"

43
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,113
The worst one is when you come out
too early.

44
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,574
Because that's just awkward
for everyone involved.

45
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,494
Because you come out
and then the car stops,

46
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,745
but you can't reach the hood.

47
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,538
So it's like, "Hey!"

48
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:47,793
"Come here.

49
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,380
No. Come closer, please.

50
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,216
I want to tell you a secret. Come here.

51
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,303
No, I'm from Africa. I have a dream.
Please come closer. I just--

52
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,180
I just want you--

53
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,182
I'm walking over here."

54
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,813
I love the city. Are you kidding me?
New York!

55
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,524
My dream was to come out here.

56
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,943
Soon as I got here,
I was like, "This is it!"

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,696
There's an energy in the city
that exists nowhere in the world.

58
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:18,865
New York, New York!

59
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,951
Love it, everything about it.

60
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,495
You know what fascinates me
about New York...

61
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,625
is how much people trust
the traffic lights.

62
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:33,046
I have never seen anything like it.

63
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,843
You must remember,
I come from an African country.

64
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,470
And all over Africa,
we have traffic lights.

65
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,972
But we don't use them.

66
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,016
All right?

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,769
It's less of a command
and more of a suggestion.

68
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,522
It's not "Stop!" It's "Stop?"

69
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,318
It's almost like
an African traveled the world,

70
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,321
saw that other people have traffic lights
and then just brought them back,

71
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,240
but didn't know what they were for.
The guy was like,

72
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,326
"Guys, guys, guys.
We need to get traffic lights. Ah?"

73
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,953
People were like, "What for?"

74
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,456
"It's for the intersection.
It adds atmosphere."

75
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,211
No one actually knew what it was about.

76
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,800
We don't care about the lights,
and we don't trust the lights.

77
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:23,221
But in New York-- I've never seen it--
people trust that light with their lives.

78
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,640
I was walking in the streets one day.

79
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,810
I was walking next to this man.
I'll never forget this.

80
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:34,441
We're standing there on the sidewalk,
and the light changes in our favor.

81
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,028
And I looked to the side,
and there was this truck

82
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,906
that is barreling down the road.

83
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,035
And I'm looking at the truck.
And as soon as the light changes,

84
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,037
the guy next to me,
he steps out into the road.

85
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,164
Instinctively,
I stuck my hand out to protect him.

86
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,082
I was like, "Yo, dude, there's a truck."

87
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,293
And he was like,
"It's okay. We've got the light."

88
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,052
I said, "Yeah, and he has a truck.

89
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:05,722
In a game of rock-paper-scissors,
you lose."

90
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,850
But he was so confident.

91
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,019
He was like,
"We've got the light. Let's go."

92
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:13,063
And he walked out.
He didn't just walk out.

93
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,565
He stared that truck driver down
as he was crossing.

94
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,859
Just looking at him.
Like, "I've got the light.

95
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,278
You know I've got the light.
You know I've got that light."

96
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,201
I was running behind him, all apologetic.

97
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,953
"I'm sorry, I didn't know.
He-- I'm sorry.

98
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,914
I would have stopped--
I've never done this before."

99
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,464
I walked with that man for 12 blocks.

100
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,843
And let me tell you,
I have never been imbued

101
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,929
with the confidence of another human being

102
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,181
the way I was with him.

103
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,684
I started that day...

104
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,188
thinking and pondering
before stepping out.

105
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,316
And after a few blocks with him,

106
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,277
I started believing.

107
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,657
And after eight blocks,
it was the only way I knew how to live.

108
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,287
I had my phone out.
I was tweeting and texting.

109
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,914
I didn't play games.
I'd be looking down, look up.

110
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,332
The light would change, and I was out.

111
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:19,212
I didn't care if a truck or a train
was coming towards me. I was out!

112
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,424
Because I've come to realize, in America,
if you got the white man on your side,

113
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:23,883
you can do whatever you like.

114
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,391
You just roll.

115
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,563
What an exciting time it's been.

116
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,150
I couldn't have chosen a better time
to come and live in the United States.

117
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,276
Huh?

118
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,528
What an exciting time.

119
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,407
I'm surprised that,
with everything that's happened,

120
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,742
it hasn't all burned down.

121
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:55,373
I've been coming to the United States,
on and off, visiting for almost ten years.

122
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,000
And...

123
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,669
what was great about visiting on and off

124
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,173
was I got to experience America
in snapshots.

125
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,217
You know, I would feel
what the people were feeling.

126
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,221
I would get an idea of what the populace
was going through.

127
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,890
And...

128
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,143
I'll never forget how every time
I came to America...

129
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,395
one of the biggest things I noticed

130
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:20,231
was how black Americans
were having a tough time.

131
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,734
I remember the first time I came out.

132
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:28,865
I was staying on the West Coast, and I met
a young African American man in Compton.

133
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,785
And we were hanging out at a comedy club.

134
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,746
This guy, he looked over at me
and he's like,

135
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,830
"Hey, yo, Trevor.

136
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,875
You the dude from Africa, man?"

137
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:41,920
I said, "Yeah, yeah.
I'm one of them, yeah."

138
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,715
He's like, "Yo, man.

139
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:49,552
I can't front, B.
It's an honor to meet you, man.

140
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,930
Yo, I always wanted to meet a dude
from Africa.

141
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,640
You're an OG, man. You're an OG."

142
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,226
I was like, "Thank you."
He was like, "Yeah, man.

143
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,353
You know how hard it is out here
for a black man?

144
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,272
Dude, I can't front, man.
You can't get no jobs, man.

145
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,316
The cops be on your ass
all the time, man.

146
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,318
I'm fittin' to go to Africa myself, man.

147
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:09,364
Yo, I'm gonna go to Africa with you, man.
I'm going with you, B."

148
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,076
And I was like, "Yeah,
you should buy the ticket, we can roll.

149
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,328
Let's go."

150
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,958
I connected with him that day.
I felt something.

151
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
Fast-forward, a few years later.

152
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,257
I remember I met...
a beautiful black woman.

153
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,218
Down South, I was doing shows
in Birmingham, Alabama.

154
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,138
This woman came up to me after the show.

155
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,890
She connected with me instantly.

156
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,434
She was like, "Trevor, baby.

157
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,104
Can I just tell you right now?

158
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:45,900
I ain't never met a stranger
I felt so connected to.

159
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,446
When you talk about Africa,
when you say those things,

160
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,615
I'm like, 'Oh, man, oh, Lord,
I wish I could go with you.'

161
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,495
Tell me all about the motherland, baby.
I want to go to a place I can call my own.

162
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:02,083
I want to go to a place where people
don't look at me like I don't belong.

163
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,795
Tell me all about Africa, baby.
Tell me all about it."

164
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,715
And I could feel what she was saying.

165
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,385
And I knew that people
weren't having a good time.

166
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,055
And then you fast-forward...

167
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,474
to 2016.

168
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,520
I'll never forget that moment
when Donald Trump...

169
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,482
closed the lead,

170
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:29,694
had a one-in-two chance of being
President of the United States.

171
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,363
And for the first time in my life,

172
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,824
I had white Americans
coming up to me, going,

173
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,328
"So, Trevor, tell me about Africa.
What's going on out there?

174
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,205
It's, uh--

175
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,459
Sounds like a plan, am I right?

176
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:49,089
What is it, motherland? Motherland, yeah.
Yeah. I should come with you.

177
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,550
<i>Ali boma ye. Count me in, buddy."</i>

178
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,354
And it's not just America as well.
It's not just America.

179
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,690
You know, a lot of Americans were shocked
by that rhetoric,

180
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,068
but if you expanded your view,

181
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:14,155
you realized that the rise of nationalism
is taking place all over the world.

182
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,032
In Austria, in Australia.

183
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,577
In England. That was what Brexit
was all about. Right?

184
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,913
They made it seem like it was about
the economy, but it wasn't.

185
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:26,668
The truth was it was fundamentally people
who wanted their country back.

186
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,795
It never went anywhere.

187
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,464
But they still wanted it back.

188
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,385
I saw people on the news,
talking to the BBC.

189
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,346
"That's why I'm voting for Brexit, right?

190
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,850
Because this bloody country
is going to the dogs.

191
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,227
Right? This bloody country.
And I want Britain back.

192
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,688
That's why we voted for Brexit,
because we want Britain back!"

193
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,814
From who?

194
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,400
From who?

195
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,736
Britain is, like, 95% white.
Who do you want it back from?

196
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,534
People say the weirdest things,
the craziest things.

197
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:02,954
"These bloody immigrants come over here.
They're up to no good, right?

198
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,040
I hate these bloody immigrants. They need
to go back to where they came from."

199
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,252
-But why do you hate them so much?
-"I'll tell you why I hate them.

200
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,421
Because they're not even trying
to be British. That's why.

201
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,214
They don't even try to be British.

202
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,550
They come here.
They bring their own bloody culture.

203
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,469
They bring their own food,
spit their own bloody languages,

204
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,513
try to take over the whole bloody place."

205
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,350
That sounds British to me.

206
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,031
If there's one country...

207
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:41,451
if there's one nation in the world,

208
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,080
that has no right to complain
about immigration,

209
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,416
it's Great Britain.

210
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,962
If there's one nation in particular.

211
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,424
You do understand,

212
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,093
they created the problem
that they are now dealing with.

213
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,931
They went out and colonized the world.

214
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,476
At one point, half of the globe
was controlled by the British Empire.

215
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,436
Do you understand how insane that is?

216
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,064
They went around colonizing
from pillar to post.

217
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,400
People didn't care about them.
No one was trying to find the British.

218
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:18,154
The British were the ones
traveling the world,

219
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,406
telling everyone of their existence,
knocking on doors.

220
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,200
"Hey, we're the British. Follow us."

221
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,371
It's basically ancient Twitter,
that's what that was.

222
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,755
I'm not saying the British are bad people,
by the way.

223
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,133
I understand that colonization was
something that was popular at one time.

224
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,344
Many European countries
participated in it.

225
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,971
But the British were the best.

226
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,140
They were the best.
It's not because they were bad. I think--

227
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:49,352
I blame it on the weather.
That's what I think happened.

228
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,730
I think they have bad weather,
and bad weather makes you a bad person.

229
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,109
Yeah, because if you think about it,

230
00:12:56,192 --> 00:13:00,697
there was no one from a tropical climate
who was trying to take over the world.

231
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,994
You don't ever hear stories
of Caribbean conquerors.

232
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,665
Yeah, there's no stories of, like,
Troy The Terrible from Trinidad.

233
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,208
You don't hear these stories.

234
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,212
There's no need for that.
When the weather is horrible,

235
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,589
you want to go somewhere else
and take it from somebody.

236
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,843
If you're living in a beautiful paradise,
you have no need to leave.

237
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,302
Could you imagine that scene?

238
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,056
Just some random handsome guys
hanging out on a beach in the Caribbean,

239
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,851
one looking at the other out of nowhere.

240
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,062
"Darius. Darius!"

241
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:34,939
"What, Troy?"

242
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,108
"I was thinking, bro.

243
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,194
Stay with me here. I was thinking, right?

244
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,280
We should build boats,

245
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:46,576
sail around the world
and force everyone to dance Calypso."

246
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,873
It wouldn't happen.

247
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,792
It just wouldn't happen.

248
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,591
The British colonized with class.
They went all over the globe.

249
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,760
And colonization--
we read it about it now,

250
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,511
and it seems normal
'cause it's in the history book.

251
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,847
They colonize.
When you think about colonization,

252
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,308
it's the strangest thing
you can think about.

253
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,477
'Cause conquering is one thing.
You go to another country,

254
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,686
you take what's theirs.

255
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,773
You want more-- you take the land.
You take the resources.

256
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,857
You kill the people.

257
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,567
That I understand.

258
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,820
But colonization--
I don't condone. I understand.

259
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,990
But colonization is strange,

260
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,159
because you go there,
and you don't just take over.

261
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,829
You then force the people to become you.

262
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,749
That is such a strange concept

263
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,626
when you think
about where the British did it.

264
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,170
I mean, they did it in Africa.

265
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,548
You know, they did it in Asia.
And think about in India.

266
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:45,259
Those cultures could not be
more diametrically opposed.

267
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,389
And out of nowhere,
the British just decided to roll up.

268
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:51,849
Imagine what the Indians
must have felt like on that day.

269
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,978
Minding your own business.
Walking through a field.

270
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,148
Next thing you know,
the British showed up on horseback.

271
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,991
"Hear ye, hear ye!

272
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,954
By order of Her Majesty the Queen,
we have arrived!

273
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,587
"You over there!
What is the name of this land?"

274
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,966
"This land over here?

275
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,635
This is called India."

276
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,305
"Well, my good man, I am here to tell you

277
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,225
that India is now under
the British Empire."

278
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,065
"And I'm glad that I can tell you

279
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,317
that India is exactly
where it was yesterday."

280
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,409
"No, no. I feel you're not understanding
what I'm saying.

281
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,036
I'm letting you know
that we are here to colonize you

282
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,496
by order of the Queen."

283
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,624
"Who is the Queen?"

284
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,210
"The Queen.

285
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,255
The Queen of England,
the Ruler of Great Britain.

286
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,340
She who was ordained by God."

287
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,010
"Which god?"

288
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,724
"God. The one true God."

289
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,269
"There are many gods, my friend.
What is the name of your god?"

290
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,607
"There is only one God.

291
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,193
And his name is God,
and you, too, shall worship him."

292
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:29,322
"You want me to worship a god,
but you don't want to tell me his name?

293
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,117
What are you talking about?
There are many gods.

294
00:16:33,201 --> 00:16:36,621
There is Shiva. There's Lakshmi.
There's Hari Krishna. There are many gods!

295
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,206
What is the name of your god?"

296
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,293
"His name is God!"

297
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,839
"You don't know the name of your god?"

298
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,718
"It's just God!"

299
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,055
"Is it like Mommy or Daddy?

300
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:59,268
You want me to worship your god,
but you don't want to tell me his name?

301
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,688
How am I going to pray to him?
What do I do? Every morning, I wake up

302
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,775
and I pray: 'Oh, dear God, I was hoping
that maybe, God, you could help me--

303
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,903
No. Sorry, not you. Other god.
No, no, other god. No, no.

304
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,489
Wrong god. No, God.
I was trying to talk-- No, no.

305
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:14,033
You're right. I should have asked
for your first name. No, God.

306
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,284
No, other god, please.

307
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,954
No, behind that god.
No, not you today, God. Other god.

308
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,289
Right. He told me you would know
who I was talking to.

309
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,709
No, other god, please. That god on the--
No, no. That god, you--'

310
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:26,337
Then I wonder why my prayers
are not getting answered."

311
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:37,139
"How dare you speak to me like that?
Do you know who I am?"

312
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,517
"No, because you never
introduced yourself."

313
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,481
"I have come here
representing Great Britain."

314
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,693
"And I have never heard of Great Britain.

315
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,444
Who gave you that name?"

316
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,700
"Well-- well, we did."

317
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,662
"You called yourselves 'great'?

318
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,456
Isn't that a little presumptuous?

319
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:07,878
Shouldn't you wait for other people
to tell you how great you are?

320
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:11,549
Shouldn't you just go around the world
and just do good things, good things?

321
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,552
Then people go, 'Oh, my God, Britain,
look how great you are!'"

322
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:23,060
"Well, I beg to differ. I believe we could
do it because we knew instinctively,

323
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,604
we are Great Britain!"

324
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,940
"Well, in that case,
welcome to Great India."

325
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:34,196
"No, it doesn't work like that!
How dare you speak to me like this!"

326
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,574
"You're the one who dares
to speak to me, okay?

327
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,659
I was here, minding my own business
in my land.

328
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,245
You came over here,
riding on your skinny cow,

329
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,539
telling me that things
are going to change.

330
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,790
I don't know who you are.

331
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,960
All I know is you are clearly crazy.
You're not feeling too right.

332
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,546
I didn't want to say anything,
but you look like you're going to faint.

333
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,840
In fact, it looks like you have died
last week. Okay?

334
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,676
Something is very wrong with your skin.
You're not looking good.

335
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,220
Maybe you should come down.
We have a curry, talk about this."

336
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:00,723
"What are you talking about?
I look quite normal!"

337
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,058
"You do not look normal.

338
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,144
I have never seen anybody
with that complexion in my life, okay?

339
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:08,648
You look like you're playing hide-and-seek
with the sun your entire life.

340
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,776
I don't know what is happening,
but that is not how a person should look.

341
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,654
I can see your veins pumping
through your skin right now.

342
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,948
You know how creepy that is?
Pumping, pumping, pumping.

343
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,326
If I was your doctor,
I don't need X-ray machine.

344
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,871
I go, 'What is problem? It is your kidney.
How do I know? Because you're translucent.

345
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,247
That is how I know.'"

346
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,542
"Damn you! We are going to run
this country whether you like it or not!"

347
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,920
"We are not going to do anything
you tell us. You're a madman."

348
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,673
"We are going to take it!"
"You're not taking--" "We're going--"

349
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,345
"She's all yours. Take, take.

350
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,555
You don't play nice. Take."

351
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,433
And that's how the British took over.

352
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,521
That's how they took over India.

353
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,654
And then, many, many years later,
the British,

354
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:00,032
after they were done pillaging,
left and went back home.

355
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:05,037
And so, it only stands to reason
that those Indians,

356
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,914
who they had now made British,

357
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,125
would seek out...

358
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,669
the land from whence they came.

359
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,091
I don't understand
why British people are complaining,

360
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:20,302
going, "Why are they coming here?
Why the hell are you coming here?!"

361
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:24,181
"Because you told us how great it was,
so we came to see for ourselves."

362
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,229
"No. Go back to where you came from!

363
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,690
Go back! You're not welcome here.
This is not your home."

364
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,568
"But you said we are all part
of the British Empire."

365
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,320
"When I said 'part,'
I meant you are under us.

366
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:41,407
We are the British. You are the empire."
"What do you mean?"

367
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,243
"We are the British,
and you are the empire."

368
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:47,037
"Okay, well, in that case,
the empire strikes back.

369
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,291
Now make some curry
and tell me where we're sitting.

370
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,959
Let's go, let go, let's go."

371
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,504
They can't complain.
They cannot complain.

372
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,922
If there's one nation in the world
that can't complain--

373
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:59,091
The truth is none of us
should be complaining.

374
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:02,428
When you think about it,
what people term "immigration"

375
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,971
just depends on your timeline.

376
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:05,931
Right? You're an immigrant.

377
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:09,143
When do you measure from?
Everyone is an immigrant from somewhere.

378
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,937
Whenever I see people have
those conversations in America:

379
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:15,399
"These damn immigrants coming over here.
These damn immigrants. Get out of here!"

380
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,486
I always wonder what Native Americans
must be thinking

381
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,280
when they are listening to the words
that are being said.

382
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:23,574
You know?

383
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,035
People confidently saying,

384
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,871
"This is not where they came from!
This is not their land!"

385
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,040
They're like, "Oh, tell me more."

386
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,626
"They need to go back
'cause this is not their home!"

387
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,710
"Oh, really?"

388
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,048
Everyone is an immigrant
in some way, you know.

389
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,968
When you travel, you see this.
I say that to people.

390
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,887
I'll go, "Travel the world."

391
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,390
If there's one thing you will never
waste your money on, it's traveling.

392
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,059
Travel the world.

393
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,895
See another place.

394
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,773
Discover a different point of view.

395
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:59,318
Traveling is the antidote to ignorance,
and that's so true.

396
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:02,863
It changes your mind, your perspective,
how you believe, what you believe.

397
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,324
And one of the greatest things
you can do when you travel

398
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,369
is traveling to a country
where they don't speak your language.

399
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,248
That's my favorite thing, going to a place
where they don't speak English,

400
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,084
just to make you realize
how insignificant you really are.

401
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,961
You're not the center of the universe.

402
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:18,754
There's another world
that exists beyond you.

403
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,173
I try and do that all the time.
I try my utmost.

404
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,342
I go to English-speaking countries,
but I try every now and again

405
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,844
to go to a country
where they speak no English.

406
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,847
Like, recently, I went to Scotland. Right?

407
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,015
And--

408
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:32,977
And again...

409
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,479
I had an amazing time.

410
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:39,775
The place was beautiful.
It was a different culture.

411
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,235
Rich in history.

412
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,154
They have the rolling highlands
of Scotland.

413
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,323
They've got these castles, beautiful,

414
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,701
perfectly preserved,
hundreds of years old.

415
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,204
In the streets, there's the men
playing the bagpipes, wearing the kilts.

416
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,331
No black people.

417
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:59,670
But not in a bad way. Not in a bad way.
Just in a matter-of-fact way, you know?

418
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,589
When I say there's no black people
in Scotland,

419
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,382
I just mean there's no black people.

420
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,925
There's a good way and a bad--

421
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,469
The good way is when you get there,
you're like, "There's no black people."

422
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:11,098
But some places you go, like,
"There's no black people." And that's--

423
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:12,224
You know what I mean?

424
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:16,437
That means some shit went down.
You can feel it when you get there.

425
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,940
Like Australia, there's no aborigines.

426
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:22,359
When you get there,
you're like, "Hey, Australia!

427
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,361
Wait, where's all the black people?"

428
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:28,115
They're like,
"Oh, I don't know. They left."

429
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,956
You can feel something went wrong.

430
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,668
Scotland doesn't have that, you know?

431
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,047
Scotland doesn't have black people
because they are further north.

432
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,842
Further north, there were no black people.
Not many black things further north.

433
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,303
The further north you go,
the whiter things become.

434
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,807
There's the people, Christmas, the bears.
Everything changes.

435
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,814
If you went to a Scottish person and said,
"Excuse me, sir. Are you racist?"

436
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,358
He'd be like,
"I don't know.

437
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,027
I never tried."

438
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,242
I had so much fun in Scotland.
I was in Glasgow for a week.

439
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,329
I was driving around in the back of a car.
Every single day,

440
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,916
I would try and spot black people.
It was a little game I played by myself.

441
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,252
Every day, I would just be there,
like, "Black person, black person...

442
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:26,006
Ah! No. Statue.
Black person, black person...

443
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,842
Ah! No. Reflection.
Black person, black person..."

444
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,053
No black people anywhere. None.

445
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,933
That's why I say traveling is important.

446
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:38,936
I'd never been to a place
where there were no black people before.

447
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,439
It actually made me realize
that there had been an issue

448
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,566
that I'd been grappling with for so long.

449
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,611
And now, finally, I had another answer.

450
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:48,696
And that issue...

451
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,698
was that of James Bond.

452
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,785
I'm a big fan of 007. License to kill.

453
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,413
I loved it my whole life.
Started with Pierce Brosnan.

454
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,707
Then went back and watch Connery's
and Lazenby's and everyone,

455
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,918
all the way to Daniel Craig.
And I love James Bond.

456
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,797
And when I found out that Daniel Craig
no longer wanted to be James Bond,

457
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,507
I was heartbroken.

458
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,259
Until I heard...

459
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,470
that, at the top of the list,
the potential replacement

460
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,473
was a man by the name Idris Elba.

461
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,563
And I lost my mind.

462
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,233
I lost my-- You can hear the ladies.
They're, like, "Yeah," you know?

463
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,528
And that's what James Bond needs:
a lady's man and a man's man,

464
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,573
and Idris has that.
He's strong. He's charming.

465
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,784
He's got that quiet thing.
"Yeah, you know, Idris Elba. Oh, yeah.

466
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,538
Idris Elba, you know?" You could just
see him playing the dapper spy.

467
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,624
And as soon as it was announced,
everyone was excited,

468
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,461
until the comments section
of the Internet came in.

469
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,589
"Idris Elba, James Bond."

470
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,300
And the comments section was like,
"Uh, actually...

471
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,553
Idris Elba could not play James Bond."

472
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,847
And we're like, "Why?"

473
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,432
They're like, "Because...

474
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,601
Hmm?"

475
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,064
"'Cause of the shape of his head?
What are you saying?"

476
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,108
"No, because..."

477
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,152
-"Because what?"
-"Because he's black!

478
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,530
James Bond cannot be played
by a black man!"

479
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:15,908
As soon as they said that,
the Internet exploded.

480
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,412
"Racism!"

481
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,331
Immediately, that happened, I jumped in.

482
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,833
I don't even know what it's about half
of the time, I jump in.

483
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,086
You say "racism," and I wreck my site.
I'm just like, "Racism!

484
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,672
Aah! You guys will explain it later.
Racism!"

485
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:33,091
I was in there, like,
"What the hell is going on?"

486
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,927
They're like, "James Bond
cannot be played by Idris Elba

487
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,095
because Idris Elba is black,
and James Bond is white!"

488
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,682
I was like, "Well, actually,
James Bond is a fictional character,

489
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,227
so he can be played by anyone,
because it is fiction!"

490
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,522
They were like, "When you think about it,
James Bond was based on a real man,

491
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,650
who was white, and so, he should be
played by a real white man."

492
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,527
I said, "That doesn't make sense.
If you think about it,

493
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,197
Jesus was technically a black man,
but he gets played by a white man.

494
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,950
So I don't know what your point is,

495
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,868
'cause that never stopped me
from receiving my blessings.

496
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,912
I don't know what you're going on about."

497
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:04,248
They're like, "You can't have it!"
I was like, "Racism!"

498
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,375
"You can't have it!" "Racism!"

499
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:11,922
And then I went to Scotland.

500
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,551
I realized that maybe, just maybe...

501
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,012
I hadn't given the argument
enough thought.

502
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,059
Because I love Idris Elba.
I want him to play Bond.

503
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:28,605
But if you think about it, James Bond
often operates in places like Scotland

504
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:30,566
and the UK and Europe.

505
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:35,070
Because that's where most supervillains
choose to reside.

506
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:39,157
I'm assuming it's for tax purposes.

507
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:48,083
No matter how you feel about the issue,
you have to admit...

508
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,921
it would be particularly difficult...

509
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,050
to be a spy...

510
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,975
when you are the only...

511
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,478
black person in town.

512
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,233
Your very existence defies your purpose.

513
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,612
I'm not saying it's impossible,

514
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,407
I'm just saying that would be the toughest
James Bond movie that was ever made.

515
00:28:21,617 --> 00:28:23,160
Can you imagine that scene?

516
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,747
Idris Elba, James Bond, planting the C-4,
blowing up the bad guy's lair,

517
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,041
jumping on a bike,
riding into the town square in Edinburgh.

518
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:34,796
The bad guys right behind him.
They pull out their guns, start shooting.

519
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:37,549
The chase is on.

520
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,563
Idris Elba, James Bond,
jumps off the bike,

521
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,982
runs into a crowded town square,
the bad guys right behind him.

522
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:56,610
He manages to shake them off,
pops into a little alley,

523
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,112
gets out on the other side,
finds a crowded little marketplace,

524
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,948
puts a scarf around his head,
a fake beard,

525
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,908
blends in with a group of monks
walking by.

526
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,493
The bad guys turn the corner.

527
00:29:06,495 --> 00:29:08,080
"There he is!"

528
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:16,338
James Bond manages to shake them off,
gets into another group of areas,

529
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,966
pops out on the other side,
finds a transportation hub,

530
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,425
gets into a bus, the bus goes one way,

531
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:22,219
gets into a tram,
the tram goes the other way.

532
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,679
The bad guys turn the corner.

533
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,349
"There he is!"

534
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,104
The movie would be ten minutes long.

535
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,276
It would end with James Bond panting
in an alley.

536
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:42,072
"How did you find me?"

537
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,704
We would lose so many epic scenes...

538
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,917
like that moment where James reveals
his name.

539
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,212
Do you know that scene in the casino
we always wait for?

540
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:01,300
Him dressed in a tux,
playing a high-stakes game of baccarat.

541
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,721
You see Idris Elba walking over
to the bartender now

542
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,180
to place that iconic order.

543
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,474
"Bartender,

544
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,020
I'll take my martini shaken, not stirred.

545
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,522
The name's..."

546
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,607
"James Bond. I know."

547
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,991
"I'm sorry, mate, have we met?"

548
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:27,868
"No.

549
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,787
I just heard there was a spy in town.

550
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:34,791
Figured it was you."

551
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,880
"What gave me away?
Is it the way I dress?"

552
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,841
"Oh, there's just something about you."

553
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,345
"Something like what?"

554
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,347
"You know...

555
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,932
Hmm."

556
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:58,857
It'll be hard.

557
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,611
Scotland was so much fun.

558
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,739
Every day I was there, I felt like
I was learning something new.

559
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,825
I did learn something
that I wish to share with you,

560
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,620
and I hope you'll not suffer
the same ills I did.

561
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:13,914
If you do go to Scotland,

562
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,958
and you are ever offered a drink...

563
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:18,960
don't.

564
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:23,256
Because, you see, the Scottish,
unlike us--

565
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,842
We drink to enjoy.

566
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,638
The Scottish drink to die.

567
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,269
I used to think
the Scottish had an accent.

568
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,981
I've now learned that's just centuries
of people trying not to throw up.

569
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,025
That's all that is.

570
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,819
"All right. What you do...

571
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,531
You laddies never had that drink--

572
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,088
I made that mistake myself.
I was doing shows in Edinburgh.

573
00:32:03,797 --> 00:32:05,298
And after one of the shows,

574
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:10,804
I left the venue and my friend Mick
was waiting for me backstage.

575
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,473
He was like, "How was your show?"
"It was good, Mick. How was yours?"

576
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,392
He's like, "Not too bad.

577
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,770
Me and the lads are going to the pub,
grab a drink. You wanna join us?"

578
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,149
I said, "No, I don't really drink, Mick.
I'm just gonna go home."

579
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:25,527
He's like, "It's not about drinking.
We're just gonna hang out, right?

580
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,070
Just grab a wee, little drink."

581
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,949
And that's where he got me.
Scottish people do that so well.

582
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,659
Just like, "A wee, little drink?"

583
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,745
Makes it sound harmless, doesn't it?

584
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,414
"Oh, just a wee, little drink?"

585
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:41,168
Sounds tiny. "Wee, little, drink.

586
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:43,837
Yeah, wee, little."
Nothing sounds dangerous like that.

587
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,382
Yeah, what happened in Nagasaki?
"Oh, they dropped a wee nuclear bomb."

588
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:52,637
Doesn't sound that bad.
He was like, "A wee, little drink."

589
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:55,432
I was like, "Let's have a wee,
little drink." So I joined him.

590
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,933
We went drinking.

591
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,019
I don't remember.

592
00:33:01,188 --> 00:33:03,356
I do remember waking up the next day
in my bed,

593
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,235
partially dressed, shirt on the floor.

594
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,362
Pants still on.

595
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:10,864
Left shoe on.

596
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,741
Right shoe on the pillow beside me.

597
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,495
And my head pounding, pounding.

598
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,498
You know when you can hear you heart
beating inside your head?

599
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:22,375
I get up and I'm like,
"Oh, I feel horrible."

600
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,710
And as I stand up--

601
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:27,047
As I stand up, I could feel--
I could feel...

602
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,341
the vomit coming. I could feel it.

603
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,092
I could feel it, like...

604
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,262
It did that thing.
But I held it. I controlled that.

605
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,599
If there's one thing you should know
about me, it's I don't throw up.

606
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,937
Let's just get that straight.
I don't throw up. I control myself.

607
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,523
When I see people throwing up,
I'm like, "You're weak.

608
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:47,192
Control yourself. You're weak."

609
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:50,487
This is my body, my temple. I control it.

610
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,532
The body tried. I was like, "No! No!"

611
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,659
My body was like,
"Come on, man. I gotta--"

612
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:58,370
I was like, "No! No! Breathe!"

613
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,459
Had it in check.

614
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:07,921
Went to the kitchen,
started to make some breakfast.

615
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,382
And as I poured the milk
into the cereal bowl,

616
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,219
my body was like, "Hey, Trevor?"

617
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,056
I was like, "What's going on, buddy?"

618
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,268
"Hey, do you mind if I burp?"

619
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:26,982
"Of course I don't mind if you burp.
You burp all the time."

620
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,693
"Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna burp right now.

621
00:34:30,527 --> 00:34:32,195
Just a standard, everyday burp."

622
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,364
"I don't know why you're warning me.

623
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,075
You never warn me usually when you burp.
You just burp."

624
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,619
"I wanted to let you know
it's just a burp. Don't worry."

625
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,496
I was like, "Okay, go ahead and burp."

626
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,415
"Okay, here it comes."
And my body was like...

627
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:48,712
But then, I caught it in my mouth.
I caught it all in my mouth, though.

628
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,463
Oh, yeah. Judge me!

629
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,635
Judge me. The only reason you know
the taste is because you're alcoholics.

630
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,804
You're gonna judge me.
We've all done that before.

631
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,514
That's the classy thing to do.

632
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,851
Catch it in your mouth, so you can handle
your business in the toilet.

633
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:07,564
Caught it all in my mouth.
I ran to the toilet.

634
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:10,150
I threw up,
and it was the worst feeling in the world.

635
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,526
I don't even drink.

636
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,070
Throwing up is now
an added reason to not--

637
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:16,698
And, you know, when you're throwing up...

638
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:20,243
the worst part for me is the dry heaving.

639
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,122
You know, when you're done,
everything is finished, but still--

640
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:28,585
That's when I know that humans
aren't as evolved as we think we are.

641
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,381
Because your body and your brain,
at that point, there's nothing left.

642
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,593
There's nothing there, and still you--
There's nothing there.

643
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,886
There's nothing.

644
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,347
And we're all in that position--
It's not gracious.

645
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,725
No one's looking cool.
Everyone is there. You're just like...

646
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:48,605
Everyone is in that same position.
No one throws up in a cool fashion.

647
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:49,773
No one's there, like...

648
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:56,696
No one. Every single one of us,
we're reduced...

649
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,240
to a pile of pain.

650
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,082
It's finished. It's finished. It's fini--

651
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:15,006
Oh, it's so sore. It's so sore.
There's nothing there.

652
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,424
Why don't you realize that--

653
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,931
Oh, please. Oh, please.
I'm dying. I'm dying.

654
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,849
I'm dying. I don't even know what--

655
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,436
And then blood came out.

656
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,690
Yeah, not good.

657
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,735
So, I panicked.
I was like, "I'm bleeding internally.

658
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,320
I need to get to the hospital."

659
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:41,241
Called my friend Mick.
I was like, "Mick, where are you?"

660
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,826
He's like, "I'm home. What's going on?"

661
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,495
I said, "I need your help.
I drank too much last night."

662
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:46,705
He's like, "Yeah. And?"

663
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:50,166
I said, "This morning, I threw up a lot."
He's like, "Yeah, right. And?"

664
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,044
I said, "And then,
while I was throwing up, blood came out."

665
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,462
He's like, "Yeah, right. And?"

666
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:59,300
I said, "And that's it, Mick.
Blood came out of my mouth."

667
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:02,137
He said, "Oh, that's too bad, Trevor.

668
00:37:02,721 --> 00:37:04,180
So, what are you gonna do now?"

669
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,350
I said, "I'm gonna go
to the hospital, Mick."

670
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,561
He's like,
"I don't know if that's necessary.

671
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,439
Like, was it a lot of blood?"

672
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,066
"Any blood is a lot of blood.
What do you mean?"

673
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,360
He's like, "I know what you're saying,
but was it a lot,

674
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:19,070
or was it a wee bit of blood?"

675
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,413
Mick didn't take me to the hospital.

676
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,875
Instead, he decided to come over
with some bananas and white bread.

677
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,793
He forced me to eat that.

678
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:36,629
And that night, I had another show.

679
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:41,551
I was horrible. It was a bad show.
And afterwards, I leave the venue.

680
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,345
And who's standing outside waiting for me?

681
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,973
My good friend Mick.

682
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,227
And he's like,
"Trevor, how was your show?"

683
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,231
I said, "It was horrible, Mick, horrible.
I thought I was gonna die."

684
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,067
He's like, "Oh, that's too bad.

685
00:37:58,151 --> 00:38:00,111
You wanna go talk about it over a pint?"

686
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,573
I said, "What?"
He's like, "Let's go grab a wee drink."

687
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:07,535
I said, "There's no wee nothing here.
There is no "wee" ever again."

688
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,788
He's like, "What are you talking about?"

689
00:38:09,871 --> 00:38:12,916
I said, "Mick, I thought I was gonna die.
I'm not gonna drink."

690
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,794
He's like, "Don't be like that.
It's just one bad day."

691
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:18,880
I was like, "Yeah, and I'd like to live
to see another, Mick.

692
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,174
I'm not going with you."
He's, like, "Trevor, don't be--"

693
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,885
I'm like, "Don't be like what?"
He's like, "Don't be a pussy."

694
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:29,015
And that's where he lost me.
That is where he lost me.

695
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,143
I understand what he was trying to do.
Guys do it all the time.

696
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,896
Hit you with the phrase,
"Don't be a pussy."

697
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,941
Yes. Because it implies weakness.

698
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,443
Yeah. Do not be like the vagina.

699
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,155
The vagina that is weak.
Yes. Yes. Don't be a pussy.

700
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,283
Guys say that, and then you do
what they want. "Don't be a pussy."

701
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:50,078
Yeah, don't be a pussy,
'cause the pussy is weak.

702
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,913
And yet,

703
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:54,624
in my personal experience...

704
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,171
I have found the pussy to be
one of the strongest things

705
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,882
I have ever come across in my life.

706
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,720
Don't be a pussy?

707
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,224
Have you ever come across a pussy?

708
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,727
The vagina is one of the most powerful--

709
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:18,690
You realize vaginas can start revolutions
and end wars.

710
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,609
You realize, even on a physical level,

711
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,863
the vagina is one of the strongest things
that have ever existed.

712
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:26,948
Virtually indestructible.

713
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,199
Many men in this room--

714
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:33,121
Many, many men in this room have tales
of how they once defeated the pussy.

715
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:37,083
Let me tell you now, they have not.

716
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:44,257
The owner of the pussy
may have given you the impression

717
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,553
that you defeated the pussy,
but it is alive and well, my friends.

718
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,017
Whenever people say that,

719
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,353
I go, "Do you understand
how impressive the vagina is?

720
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,147
Do you understand how strong it is?"

721
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,608
There's a reason men have sought
to oppress it for so long.

722
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,569
The vagina is frighteningly powerful.

723
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:09,490
You realize human beings come out
of a vagina.

724
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,160
Human beings come out,

725
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,371
and still it continues
to work as intended.

726
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:19,584
Do you understand how impressive that is?

727
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,923
I don't know if I'm the only one.
New York, do you understand?

728
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,508
A human being comes out...

729
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,178
of the vagina.

730
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,347
And still, it continues to operate,

731
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,391
and it continues to work
after a human has just come out.

732
00:40:35,475 --> 00:40:38,311
You're saying it's weak?
A human came out of the vagina.

733
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:41,272
You just sit on a penis wrong,
and it breaks. You just--

734
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,752
"Don't be a penis,"
that should be the phrase.

735
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,257
"Don't be a pussy."

736
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,219
I wish I was a pussy.

737
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,013
Are you serious right now?

738
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,062
"Don't be a penis,"
that should be the saying.

739
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:23,815
Scotland taught me so many things.

740
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:28,111
Beautiful place, beautiful people,
rich in culture.

741
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:32,115
My favorite thing to do while I was there
was trying to learn the Scottish accents.

742
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,575
I butcher it, but I don't care.
I have fun.

743
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,870
What I do when I travel is try
to speak to people in their accents

744
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:41,582
and see if they can catch me out.
That's one of my favorite games.

745
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:44,460
I'd walk into a store in Edinburgh,
and I'd just be like...

746
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:45,920
"Good afternoon.

747
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,841
I would like to buy a pair of shoes."

748
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:53,469
He'd be like, "Where are you from?"

749
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,348
"I'm from Scotland."

750
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,643
"Aye, what part?"

751
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,479
"Johannesburg."

752
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,321
I love it, though. I love the accents
not just because they sound fun

753
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:14,407
and it's an interesting thing to do.

754
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,993
I love accents
because I'm always impressed

755
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,829
by how much power they have over us,
over our minds.

756
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:25,293
When someone speaks a certain way,
it changes how we feel about that person,

757
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,253
for good and for bad.

758
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,631
We do it all the time.
You see people on the streets,

759
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,258
they speak to you,
you think of them a different way.

760
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,552
You see world leaders.
They speak a certain way,

761
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,055
you think of them a different way.
You know?

762
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:40,099
Barack Obama,
one of the greatest examples of that.

763
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:44,145
Everything about Barack. Barack Obama was,
by far, the coolest president

764
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,605
that has ever existed.

765
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,359
Just everything about the man, you know?

766
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:54,989
That confidence, the smile, the swag.

767
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:58,951
When you notice Barack--
I would notice it in the small things,

768
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:01,120
like when he'd step out of Air Force One.

769
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,831
He did it like no other president
in the world.

770
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,835
Normally, presidents step out
of their airplane in a frumpy manner.

771
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,963
There's no class or skill.
They just, like, come out.

772
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,594
But Barack...

773
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,764
he wouldn't step out. He'd emerge.

774
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,935
He'd emerge like he was stepping out
of the plane

775
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,978
and into a music video.

776
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,398
He'd do that thing where he'd come out...

777
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,995
And then he'd go down the stairs,
doing it the only way he could, you know?

778
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:50,545
The way he descended, it looked like
every time he hit the ground,

779
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,965
he was just gonna go into verse one.
Just straight into it, like...

780
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,675
<i>♪ Girl ♪</i>

781
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,262
<i>♪ I wanna take you there ♪</i>

782
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,431
<i>♪ Give you my Obamacare ♪</i>

783
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,479
Oh, man.

784
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,440
Barack Obama's just too cool.

785
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,194
He had the walk. He had the talk.

786
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,989
That was the big thing people
never realized about Barack Obama,

787
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,198
was the talk.

788
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:22,618
That's what really gave him the edge.
He has a certain way of speaking,

789
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,079
a certain voice
that commands your attention,

790
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,456
makes you feel about him a certain way.

791
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,375
It's the accent, the way he speaks.

792
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,212
And I don't know
how many people realized this,

793
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:37,258
but Nelson Mandela had the same thing.

794
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,344
Yeah.

795
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,182
See, the thing Barack Obama has
in his voice,

796
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,934
that is the voice
of a first black president.

797
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,604
A lot of people didn't notice that

798
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,940
because he was the first and last
first black president

799
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,400
of the United States.

800
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,196
You wouldn't know to compare.
I'm lucky in that I've gotten to be--

801
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,242
I've gotten to live in the country
of two first black presidents,

802
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,369
namely, Nelson Mandela and Barack Obama.

803
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,079
So, I know what I'm talking about.

804
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,665
They both have that thing.
It's just difficult to hear

805
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:12,585
because Mandela's obviously South African,
and he was older.

806
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,086
They both had that thing in the voice.

807
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,673
When Nelson Mandela would speak,
a room would silence.

808
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:19,383
You could feel the energy.

809
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,677
"I believe...

810
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:28,434
that every person,
regardless of the color of their skin,

811
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:35,733
should have equal rights,
and they may never be taken again.

812
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:41,030
To those who would seek to oppress,
I say to you, never,

813
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:43,282
and never again."

814
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,159
And the people would lose their minds.

815
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:48,329
People would feel the chills,
because he had that thing.

816
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:53,167
Nelson Mandela was destined for greatness
because of that voice.

817
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:56,003
He could not be a normal man
with a voice like that.

818
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,089
You can't do normal things
with that voice.

819
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,717
You are destined for greatness.
You can't be running in the streets:

820
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,219
"And a Kit Kat, please."

821
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,597
No. No.

822
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:11,227
It's so unique. You can't be silly.
What are you making, prank phone calls?

823
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,437
"Who the hell is this?!"
"I'm not telling you."

824
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,275
It just doesn't work.

825
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:23,114
I remember when Nelson Mandela
was still alive,

826
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,324
and he would tell jokes

827
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:28,244
at press conferences and events,
and no one would laugh.

828
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,914
Because everyone thought a man
who had been in jail for 27 years

829
00:46:31,998 --> 00:46:33,124
couldn't make a joke.

830
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:36,168
And yet, he still did.
He still kept what was him.

831
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,212
It was partly because of that voice.

832
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,882
He would tell the joke, and it would
just sound too epic for people to laugh.

833
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:46,137
Everything he did, he'd just be like,
"Ah, knock, knock."

834
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,558
People would be like,
"Let him in. Let him in!"

835
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,519
"No. No, no.

836
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,605
You must say, 'Who's there?'"

837
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,985
"He is so right.
We've always got to ask, 'Who's there?'

838
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:04,196
Who's here? Who are we?' Oh, my God!"

839
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:12,246
It was because of that voice,
the first black president voice.

840
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,584
And I'll never forget the day
I saw a picture...

841
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:23,507
of Barack Obama meeting Nelson Mandela
for the very first time.

842
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:27,803
It's a beautiful image,
and it's of the two men in silhouette.

843
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,140
In Chicago,
Nelson Mandela sitting in a chair.

844
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,560
Barack Obama leaning over him.
And this was way back in the day.

845
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,813
This was before Barack Obama
was a blip on the presidential radar.

846
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,858
He was a junior senator.
Not many people knew his name.

847
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,152
Back then, he was driving around
in his own car.

848
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,029
No motorcade. Had his aide with him.

849
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:48,074
And that day, they heard Nelson Mandela
was going to be in Chicago meeting people.

850
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,910
Barack Obama wanted
to meet him his whole life.

851
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,996
He rushed over there.
He was the last person Nelson Mandela saw.

852
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,706
The last person he saw that day.

853
00:47:56,499 --> 00:47:59,376
And I always imagine
Nelson Mandela was sitting in the room,

854
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,213
and his assistant came over.
She was like,

855
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,341
"Mr. Mandela, I know we said we're done.

856
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:08,969
But unfortunately, there's this one person
who would like to meet you, sir."

857
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:13,808
He's like, "Oh, Zelda.
I'm so tired. Can we leave?"

858
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,435
"No, I know you want to leave,
Mr. Mandela.

859
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:19,021
But there's a young man there
you really need to meet.

860
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,900
His name is Barack Hussein Obama."

861
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,529
"Barack Hussein Obama?

862
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,448
He's American?"

863
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,117
"Yes, that's correct."

864
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,244
"He's going to have a tough time.

865
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:37,873
Where is he?"

866
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,376
"He's right outside the door."

867
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,419
"Okay. Show him in. Show Barack in."

868
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:45,881
"Okay, I'll be right back."
And she went over to the door.

869
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:50,386
She's like, "Mr. Obama,
Mr. Mandela will see you now."

870
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:54,265
And Barack walked in.
He was super excited to meet his idol.

871
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,892
Nelson Mandela was sitting on the chair.
He looked over.

872
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:02,064
"Ah. Young Barack. How are you?"

873
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,359
And Barack was like,
"Oh, man, Nelson Mandela,

874
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,862
this is the craziest day of my life!
I can't believe this shit!

875
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,406
I can't believe I'm meeting Nelson Mandela
for the first time.

876
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,325
I waited my whole life for this moment.
I want to be just like you.

877
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:14,827
I read your books.
I saw what you were doing in prison.

878
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,704
I was like, 'I'll be the first
black president of America.'

879
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:18,706
I'm gonna do the same things you did.
I'm gonna win those votes.

880
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,208
I'm gonna be
the first black President of America!"

881
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:24,170
And Nelson Mandela was like,
"Not with that voice.

882
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,302
You will scare the white people."

883
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:35,472
"Oh, man, Nelson Mandela,
this is the greatest day of my life.

884
00:49:35,556 --> 00:49:39,310
I don't even understand how--
I want to know from you, how do I do it?

885
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:42,605
How do I do what you did? How do I
become the first black president?"

886
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,940
"Well, first things first.

887
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,319
We need to change that voice.

888
00:49:49,612 --> 00:49:53,449
You don't sound like you are going
to lead anything."

889
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,368
"I don't know what you mean."

890
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,330
"You are speaking so fast.

891
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,916
Slow it down.

892
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,543
You're not being chased anymore."

893
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,008
"Wow, I never thought of it like that."

894
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,885
"Slow down. Slow down."

895
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,305
"Okay. I guess I do speak fast sometimes.

896
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,183
-Like, I could--"
-"Slower than that."

897
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:22,394
"I could slow it down.
I could slow it way down.

898
00:50:22,478 --> 00:50:24,021
Is this good?"

899
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:29,568
"That's better.
Now, you need to make sure...

900
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,072
you add some bass to your voice."

901
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,617
"I don't know why that's an issue."

902
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,455
"Imagine if I spoke like this.

903
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,377
Do you think people
would have voted for me?

904
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,047
No. I would still be in jail.

905
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,509
Bring some bass."

906
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,429
"Okay, I could try to--

907
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,974
I could try to bring some bass.
Is that--"

908
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,600
"Lower than that."

909
00:51:01,684 --> 00:51:05,187
"I can go lower than that. Is that good?"

910
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,647
"Lower than that."

911
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,732
"Lower, lower. Way down.

912
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:11,360
I could keep it here.
I could keep it here."

913
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,820
"That's better.

914
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,698
Now, very important:

915
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,493
to be a first black president, your pacing

916
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,871
must... be... powerful.

917
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:29,795
Every word... must seem...
like the last...

918
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,881
you will ever speak."

919
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,595
"Wow, that's powerful, Mr. Mandela.

920
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,431
Let me try...

921
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,766
to speak like that.

922
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,852
Does that work?"

923
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,938
"That's good. Very good.

924
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,690
I can feel it.

925
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,192
Yes. Now, for the magic touch.

926
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:59,033
To be first black president,
you need to have the husk."

927
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,419
"No. More husky."

928
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,429
"That's it. You are getting it now."

929
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,394
"That's it. I think you've got it.

930
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,563
Now, repeat after me.

931
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,814
America."

932
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,608
"America."

933
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:36,403
"No. The husk. Bring the husk back.
America."

934
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,114
-"America."
-"America."

935
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,449
"America."

936
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:41,950
"America."

937
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,661
-"America."
-"Yes! I can feel it.

938
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:46,622
Say, 'This is my country.'"

939
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,333
-"This is my country."
-"Yes!

940
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,962
-This is my dream!"
-"This is my dream."

941
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:55,798
"Yes, I can feel it."

942
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,592
You are going to be
the first black president."

943
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,427
"I don't know. Do you think we can do it?"

944
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,846
-"Yes, we can."
-"Yes, we can."

945
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,350
-"Yes, we can."
-"Yes, we can."

946
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,812
-"Yes, we can."
-"Yes, we can."

947
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,481
"Ha ha! You've got it right.

948
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,566
Now, go get them, my nigga."

949
00:53:33,419 --> 00:53:35,337
I'd like to think that's how it went down.

950
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,136
It's crazy and frightening

951
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,347
when you think about how
just the way you speak

952
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,475
can determine and change
your path in life.

953
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:50,477
We still do it today.

954
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,772
It's the reason half of the world
has immigrant problems.

955
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:57,317
It's not really immigrant problems.
It's the fear of something different.

956
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,570
When people say they don't like
immigrants, most of the time,

957
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,156
they're not referring to immigrants
who look and sound like them.

958
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,784
They're talking about immigrants
who speak differently, who look different.

959
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,454
You know,
'cause an accent comes with a connotation.

960
00:54:08,537 --> 00:54:11,373
You think you know if someone is smart
or stupid because of their accent.

961
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:13,876
And yet, an accent
is not a measure of intelligence.

962
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,420
It's just someone speaking your language
with the rules of theirs.

963
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,590
Accents have connotations.
We cannot deny it.

964
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:23,510
Look at the French. We all believe
that the French are romantic.

965
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,305
Why? Because of their accent.

966
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,182
They've got that thing.

967
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,732
"I was thinking that maybe we could--

968
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:41,403
how you say-- afterwards,
maybe we could try to..."

969
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,617
"Oh, my God, he's so sexy. Oh, my God."

970
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,332
Accents determine how we see people.
Same thing happens with the Russians.

971
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,627
The Russians,
the most feared people on the planet.

972
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,129
Why? Because of how they speak.

973
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:02,424
I don't care who you are, you cannot deny
that when a Russian speaks,

974
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,634
you are not comfortable.

975
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,558
As soon as they open their mouths:

976
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:13,936
"Yeah. Going to kill you, break you.

977
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,105
I'll destroy your family."

978
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:22,611
Even if they say nice things,
it still sounds menacing and dangerous.

979
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:25,113
"Yeah, fluffy rabbits and teddy bears.

980
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,535
Happy Valentine's Day."

981
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,247
Sounds like a threat.

982
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,377
You don't mess with Russians.
I don't care who you are, where you are,

983
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,505
you do not mess with the Russians
because of that accent.

984
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:43,924
All of us in the world
are afraid of the Russians.

985
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:48,428
They do that thing when they speak.
Strikes fear into the hearts of men.

986
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:50,556
And you see it every single day.

987
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:52,307
Look what happened at the Olympics.

988
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:56,186
We found out the Russians have been doping
for the last four or five Olympics.

989
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,647
Olympic Committee banned them,
confidently as well.

990
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,399
While they were in Zurich.

991
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,112
"We here at the Olympic Committee

992
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:08,448
feel that the Russians may no longer
participate in the Olympic Games

993
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,492
to their doping practices.

994
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:14,705
And they are now hereby uninvited
from the Games in Rio

995
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,750
and banned hitherto into the future.
Thank you very much."

996
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,962
And the Russians were like,
"What did you say?"

997
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,550
"The truth is, you know,
the Olympics is for everybody.

998
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,260
You can come when you want to.

999
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:31,138
<i>I mean, who am I to ban you, ja?</i>

1000
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,724
This is for all of us.
Okay. I see you in Rio.

1001
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,559
<i>Okay. Auf wiedersehen. Bye-bye."</i>

1002
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,605
Everyone's afraid of the Russians.

1003
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,358
You see it when it comes to geopolitics.

1004
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:45,777
Look at what happened in the Ukraine.

1005
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,989
Russia took a piece of another country.

1006
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,658
Annexed Crimea. No provocation, no reason.

1007
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,497
Out of nowhere, the Russians
were just like, "Yeah. I like."

1008
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,753
And the whole world, what did we do?

1009
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:12,179
You don't mess with the Russians.
Most frightening people in the world.

1010
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,639
You know how I know this?
You know how I've learned?

1011
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:17,351
Because I've learned how to use
the Russian accent for myself.

1012
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,021
I've learned how to harness that energy
and use it for good.

1013
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,940
I'll share this with you, I don't mind.

1014
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:25,484
I, uh--

1015
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:31,657
I'm not particularly comfortable
in the house at night by myself.

1016
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,078
What I'm trying to say
is I'm afraid of the dark.

1017
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:41,249
And I know it's stupid
to be afraid of the dark, right?

1018
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,919
Because there's nothing there,
nine times out of ten.

1019
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,883
But what happens is, I'll be sleeping.

1020
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:55,305
And in the middle of the night,
I'll be woken up by the need to pee.

1021
00:57:56,431 --> 00:58:00,686
And whenever that happens,
I'm always faced with the eternal dilemma.

1022
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:07,150
When I go to the bathroom,
do I turn the lights on and lose my sleep?

1023
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:12,197
Or do I leave the lights off
and shit myself?

1024
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,159
I never know which one to go with.

1025
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:21,373
But what I started doing now
is I leave the lights off.

1026
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,669
And when I go the bathroom, I just speak
to myself in a Russian accent.

1027
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,338
It sounds crazy, but I feel safe.

1028
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:31,633
I feel like I'm the most dangerous thing
in the night.

1029
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,594
You'll find me at three a.m.,
barefoot, walking to the toilet,

1030
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:37,264
like, "Yes.
Big boy got to make a pee-pee.

1031
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:43,687
No trouble over here. It's potty time."

1032
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,898
I feel safe, like even if there's
a monster under the bed,

1033
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,400
he'd be like, "Is that a Russian?"

1034
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,862
There's just something
about that Russian accent.

1035
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:55,073
Ladies, every single one of you
needs to learn the Russian accent.

1036
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:57,784
You read stories all the time.
I talk to my female friends all the time,

1037
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:01,246
my family members,
and women are constantly under assault.

1038
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,248
Women are living a life
of being vulnerable.

1039
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,208
Walking through the streets,
men catcalling.

1040
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:08,295
In the office place, people groping.

1041
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,173
Feeling like they have ownership
of the female form.

1042
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:14,676
I know we can't solve this tomorrow,
but if you learn the Russian accent,

1043
00:59:15,594 --> 00:59:17,429
half of those problems would disappear.

1044
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,640
The next time you're
in a compromising position,

1045
00:59:20,724 --> 00:59:23,393
you're at a bar,
waiting for your drink.

1046
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:26,646
That creepy guy comes up
and starts grinding on you from behind.

1047
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,900
"Hey, how are you?
Hey, you want to dance?"

1048
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:32,944
"No, I'm fine, thank you.
I'm just getting a drink. I don't--"

1049
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:36,573
"Come on, dance with me, girl."
"I'm fine. I don't wanna dance. Thank you.

1050
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,408
I'm waiting for my friends. I'm good."

1051
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,452
<i>"Come on. ♪ I know you want me ♪</i>

1052
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:43,038
<i>♪ You know I want you ♪ Come on!</i>

1053
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,706
<i>♪ I know you want me ♪"</i>

1054
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,833
"I don't want dance with you. Please!"

1055
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:49,211
"Hey, you don't gotta be such a bitch!"

1056
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:52,589
Whenever that happens, ladies,
don't be afraid, don't stress.

1057
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:55,550
Just whip out your Russian
and kill it dead.

1058
00:59:56,218 --> 00:59:59,137
As soon as he says,
"Don't be such a bitch!"

1059
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:01,014
Just be like...
"You want to see bitch?"

1060
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:06,520
Done.

1061
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,397
Sober up and walk away.

1062
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,359
Use it for anything, ladies.

1063
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,655
Anything. At work, in the streets.
Use it at home.

1064
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,825
Doesn't have to be life-or-death,
could be a mild annoyance. Yeah.

1065
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,120
Next time you're in bed.
You're trying to sleep,

1066
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:26,373
but you can't because there's
this horny little rabbit behind you...

1067
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,292
dry-humping your back.

1068
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,546
You know the nights I'm talking about.

1069
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,133
Everyone in this room knows the nights
I'm talking about.

1070
01:00:36,216 --> 01:00:39,761
Ladies, you're dog-tired,
you just want to fall asleep.

1071
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,388
And he's there behind you.

1072
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,310
"Baby.

1073
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,273
Baby.

1074
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,068
Baby.

1075
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:58,697
Baby."

1076
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,325
"What?"

1077
01:01:03,827 --> 01:01:04,995
"Are you sleeping?"

1078
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:10,625
"Yeah, I'm trying. What do you want?"

1079
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:14,546
"I want you, baby.
I've wanted you all night.

1080
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:17,132
Oh, I want you so bad.
You look so good right now.

1081
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:20,760
In that nightgown and your curlers, girl.
I just want you so bad right now."

1082
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,930
"Oh, baby.
Thank you for thinking I'm beautiful

1083
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,432
even though I'm in my curlers,

1084
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,018
but, please, can we talk
about this tomorrow?

1085
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,729
I'm so tired. Baby, aren't you tired?"

1086
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,691
"I'm never tired for you, girl.
I want you right now."

1087
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,236
"Oh, baby, please. Let's do this tomorrow.
Please, I'm so tired.

1088
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:40,155
I just want to sleep."

1089
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,407
"It's fine. You can sleep.

1090
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:44,659
I don't mind."

1091
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:46,870
"No, I'm not gonna--"

1092
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,966
Yo, for real, ladies, can I just say,
men are creeps.

1093
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:05,222
On behalf of all men, I apologize,
because we are disgusting creeps.

1094
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,640
Every single one of us.

1095
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:09,059
"No, I'm not gonna sleep.

1096
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:12,020
What's wrong with you?
What are you talking about?"

1097
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,688
"What do you mean?
I want you, is that so bad?"

1098
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:16,316
"I'm just tired."
"You said when we left the show,

1099
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,859
'That was fun, we had a good time.'

1100
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:20,528
Then we're driving home. You were like,
'I can't wait to get you back.'"

1101
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:24,115
"I know I said that, and I did,
I wanted to. But then I got into bed.

1102
01:02:24,199 --> 01:02:28,119
I didn't even realize how tired I was.
Baby, please. I promise you I'm not--"

1103
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:31,164
"You do this to me all the time.
What am I supposed to do now?

1104
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:34,459
Look at me. Do you know how hard it is
to have blue balls, how painful this is?

1105
01:02:34,542 --> 01:02:36,586
What am I supposed to do now with this?"

1106
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,713
I love how guys talk about an erection

1107
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,216
like it's something bought at the store
and we can't return.

1108
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:46,096
Then he says,
"What am I supposed to do with this?

1109
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:50,183
I've opened it. I can't take it back. Huh?
What am I supposed to do with this?"

1110
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,645
Whenever that happens,
you aren't fighting the man,

1111
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,146
you're fighting his horniness.

1112
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,315
It's gonna turn into a fight
that's gonna spoil your week,

1113
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:59,234
maybe your month. Don't let it happen.

1114
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,778
Just get your Russian out
and kill it dead.

1115
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,197
As soon as he starts losing it--

1116
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,783
"You're doing this all the time.
You reject me. I just want you."

1117
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:11,204
And just be like, "Okay, okay.
Show me what penis can do. Let's go.

1118
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,000
Make action, lover boy."

1119
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,877
Done.

1120
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,007
Problem solved.

1121
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,593
Even the penis will be like,
"You know what, you're right.

1122
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:29,639
I told him, but he wouldn't listen to me.
I don't know how we got to this point.

1123
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:33,727
Because what happened was he called me.
'Come out, there's a party.' I came out.

1124
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,520
I was like, 'You're sleeping?'
He's like, 'I'll wake her up.'

1125
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,272
I was like, 'Don't wake her up.'
You know me. I don't wake you.

1126
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,399
I'm here five times a night.
I've never woken you.

1127
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,192
I don't know why he woke you up.

1128
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:44,446
I'm gonna be chilling.
I had some stuff to do. Go back to bed.

1129
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:47,198
Because I respect you. I have paperwork
that I'm handling in my office.

1130
01:03:47,282 --> 01:03:49,367
If you need me, you know where to find me.
He shouldn't have done that.

1131
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:51,494
I want to apologize,
'cause I don't think you should be

1132
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:55,123
in a situation
where a man is pressuring you."

1133
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,213
Done.

1134
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:05,842
Kill it dead, ladies.

1135
01:04:07,218 --> 01:04:08,970
All you need is that Russian accent.

1136
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,307
The most dangerous accent in the world.

1137
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:14,601
And yet... yet...

1138
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:16,978
strangely enough...

1139
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:22,567
I found the Russian language
does not make me fear at all.

1140
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,569
Strangest discovery I made.

1141
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:29,699
The Russian accent... makes me fear.

1142
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,868
The Russian language does not.

1143
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,580
Because a language is something
someone else speaks.

1144
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:40,460
An accent is me interpreting
how they're using mine.

1145
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,046
It's a completely different thing.

1146
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,131
I was walking through the streets.

1147
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,510
There was a man on the phone, Russian guy,
speaking to someone in English.

1148
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,595
Sounded like he was setting up
a drug deal.

1149
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:55,600
Then he switched into Russian.
The strangest thing happened in my brain.

1150
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:58,812
And he was like, "Vlad. The guys
got to be there at three o'clock.

1151
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,980
Tell me when you get the package.

1152
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:04,943
Afterwards, I got to let you know--
No, Vlad. No, listen. Vlad, Vlad.

1153
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,194
<i>Vlad, nyet, nyet, Vlad."</i>

1154
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,041
That was the weirdest thing in my head.

1155
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:23,753
In my head, he instantly went

1156
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:27,048
from international criminal
to immigrant instantly.

1157
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,800
I wasn't afraid anymore.
It was the strangest thing.

1158
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:32,512
He was just a normal person in my mind,
because Russian doesn't frighten me.

1159
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:37,350
If anything, Russian just sounds
like a DJ is scratching on a turntable.

1160
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:41,271
That's all I hear when I hear Russian,
like a DJ took a turntable.

1161
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:45,233
They're scratching English like, "Vlad,
the guys got to be there at three o'clock.

1162
01:05:45,316 --> 01:05:47,068
You got to let me know
when you get the package.

1163
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,987
Afterwards, the guy's got to call me.

1164
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,074
Don't worry about that.
I'll let you know. No, Vlad. Listen, Vlad.

1165
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,628
Russian. That's all I'm hearing.

1166
01:06:05,712 --> 01:06:08,298
New York, you guys have been amazing.
Thank you so much for coming out.

1167
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:11,301
I had a great time with all of you.

1168
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,972
You just made one of my dreams come true.

1169
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,850
Thank you to every single one
of you that came tonight.

1170
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,561
Thank you. Good night.
