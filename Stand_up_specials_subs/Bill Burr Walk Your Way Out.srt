1
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,443
All right, thank you.

2
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,071
Thank you very much. How are you?

3
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,281
How's it going?

4
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,369
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

5
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,871
Nice to be here.

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,541
Nice to be here. Thank you.

7
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:43,168
I appreciate it.
Let's see if I'm funny first.

8
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,295
Let's see if I'm funny.

9
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,673
Nice to be here in Nashville.

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,801
Look at me.
I went out and got myself a cowboy shirt.

11
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,010
Right?

12
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,887
To fit in with all you guys

13
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,764
coming in from your ranches.

14
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,349
Huh?

15
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,892
Living out there in the barns.

16
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,227
Is this what you're doing?

17
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,523
You're like, "I'm working on an app,
okay?"

18
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:07,150
"To launch this website."

19
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,778
Um...

20
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,698
Oh, shit.
What a fucked-up time this is, huh?

21
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,159
It's so weird to tape a special
right before a presidential election,

22
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,744
especially one like this.

23
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,539
Like, this is literally, like, 
"What is going to happen?"

24
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:25,669
You know? How the fuck did we end up
with these two? Jesus Christ.

25
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,046
This is like
the first week of <i>American Idol</i>.

26
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,758
You know?
It's like, "Really? This is what I got?"

27
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,053
"Take his coat! Take his coat!"

28
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,141
Whatever the hell she's doing. You know?

29
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:44,813
It's unbelievable. You've either got
a racist dope or, like, the devil.

30
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,024
Like, that's the choices.

31
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,945
"I just walk up
and grab it! I just grab it!"

32
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,365
All right.

33
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:57,743
Is that what you do?

34
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,455
Fucking lunatic. "I'm gonna build a wall.

35
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:02,748
I'm gonna build a wall."

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:07,294
I love people thinking he's actually gonna
do that. Really? Are you gonna do that?

37
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,172
You're gonna build a wall
from fucking California to Texas?

38
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,340
You're gonna do this?

39
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,634
Have you ever done that drive?

40
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,011
Because I've done that drive.

41
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,097
Took the 10 East out of Los Angeles.

42
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,225
That is a two-day drive, 80 miles an hour.

43
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,481
Just wall, wall, wall.

44
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,650
You're in there like John Goodman

45
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,817
in <i>Raising Arizona</i>...

46
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,736
just driving.

47
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,072
Like, how many times

48
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,407
are you gonna go to Home Depot

49
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,617
to build this thing?

50
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,079
You actually think
you're gonna get this done?

51
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,789
Look at the Freedom Tower.

52
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,707
We actually wanted that shit

53
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,168
and it took almost 15 years
to get it done.

54
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,463
Half the people
don't even want this fucking thing.

55
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,257
I'm telling you,
by the time they've finished it,

56
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,803
this country will be so fucked up,
we're gonna be the ones going over it.

57
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,932
"Dude, they got... they got real sugar!"

58
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,977
"They got real sugar in their Coke!"

59
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,854
"I heard, on the other side,

60
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,066
the Orange Crush
tastes like it did in 1978."

61
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:16,029
Remember that two-year period
when it was actually delicious?

62
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,698
Yeah. So you've got him
and then you've got Hillary.

63
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,951
Hillary's just like a made guy.

64
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,411
Just a made-fucking-guy.

65
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,540
Everybody thinks, like, you know,
she dresses like a real-estate agent.

66
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,500
You know? Nothing to worry about.

67
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,585
She's a fucking made guy.

68
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,587
She's gonna give 'em the wars,

69
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,090
she's gonna microchip the babies,

70
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,299
phase out the cash.

71
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,178
She's not gonna do it, but she's gonna
keep steering it in that direction.

72
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,181
Privatizing water.
Water's not a basic human right.

73
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,266
She's gonna...

74
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,768
go through the whole fucking thing,

75
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,521
that psycho fucking thing that you do

76
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,314
when you go after that kind of power.

77
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,985
You've got to put it all over here
in a little box, all your evil,

78
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,237
as you're just sitting there,
fucking smiling,

79
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,989
knowing what's really going on.

80
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,867
As you're talking to Joe Sixpack.

81
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,786
He puts his pants on one leg at a time.

82
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,665
No, it's so fucking, you know...

83
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,752
It's unreal. Like, I don't know...

84
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,629
These are the two worst choices ever.

85
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:19,009
Trump, if he wasn't...
if he wasn't so fucking racist...

86
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,387
If he wasn't so racist...
I can deal with the pussy-grabbing.

87
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,722
That's not in my world.

88
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,517
I'm selfish, like every other voter,
all right?

89
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,729
If he wasn't so fucking racist...

90
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,565
he would actually scare me a little less,

91
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,817
because he's so obviously a dope.

92
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:38,403
He's so dumb, I don't think
he could get away with anything.

93
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,738
You know what he reminds me of?

94
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,281
Have you ever watched <i>Law & Order</i>

95
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,035
and they make an arrest, like,
within the first 15 minutes, you know,

96
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,287
and they're trying to get you to think,
"We got him!"

97
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,540
You're just looking at your watch.
"There's no way this guy did this shit."

98
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,336
"There's, like, another 45 minutes left."

99
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,671
"This can't be the guy.

100
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,964
Who's the real guy?"

101
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,302
And that's when fucking Hillary,
she fucking comes walking in.

102
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,806
Yeah, she goes to those
Bilderberg meetings, you know,

103
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,517
where they dress up like pheasants
and they fuck each other.

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,601
Right?

105
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,729
Sacrifice some employee from a Best Buy.

106
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,483
Fight over his name tag for a trophy.

107
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,567
Right?

108
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,697
Who do you pick? I've got no idea.

109
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,700
So I've just been, like, regressing.
I can't deal with this shit.

110
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,202
I just want to hit pause.

111
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,372
I don't want this election to fucking
happen, so I've just been regressing,

112
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,209
and I'm just watching
the dumbest shit I possibly can.

113
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,544
You know, morning time,

114
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,547
those stupid talk shows
to get soccer moms' day started.

115
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,591
You know,
they have all those non-thinking stories.

116
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,635
"You love him. He's your best friend.

117
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,928
But did you ever wonder,

118
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,306
what does your dog do
when you're not home?"

119
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,434
"The next video may surprise you."

120
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:55,397
And I just... "Fill it up!
Fill up my brain with this dumb shit!

121
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,941
I don't want to deal with
what's really going on."

122
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,528
"Nationwide heroin epidemic? Fuck that!"

123
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,114
"It's National Taco Day.

124
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,700
We've got Tony from Tony's Taco.

125
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,120
Tony, what is it that makes a great taco?"

126
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,123
"Well, it's all about starting out
with the tortilla."

127
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,002
Like, watching them making pancakes
and all that shit.

128
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,213
Talking to the ladies,
talking about body issues.

129
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,756
They always talk about body issues.

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,718
That's the dumbest one ever,
when they talk about Hollywood.

131
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,306
"Hollywood, they create these impossible
body images. Blah-blah-blah."

132
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,183
You know, that whole thing.
The plus-size actress.

133
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,268
Right?

134
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,519
The fatties.

135
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,188
You know? That's like a big thing.

136
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,649
They're sick of being treated
like fat people.

137
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,443
I don't know what it is.

138
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,821
They're going on the cover of magazines
now, just showing how fat they are,

139
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,241
wearing a little amount of clothes,
and everybody's, like, hyping 'em up.

140
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,702
Like, "Oh, my God. That's so brave!

141
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,704
That's so courageous!"

142
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,582
I'm not saying it doesn't take balls,

143
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,626
but that's a bit of an overreach

144
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,211
with the word "brave," right?

145
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:04,507
Like, what am I supposed to do if I ever
see a fireman running out of a building

146
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,176
carrying a baby and an old lady?

147
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,678
Am I gonna sit there like, "Oh, my God!

148
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,805
You're like a fat actress

149
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:12,724
that takes her shirt off

150
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,601
to do a magazine shoot

151
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,394
to promote the movie she's in"?

152
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:23,485
Now, look, I know you're not supposed
to make fun of fat people.

153
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,278
I understand, all right?

154
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,696
I don't know why, though.

155
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,118
Why? They're not a race,
they're not a religion.

156
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,662
It's totally curable.

157
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,457
Eat an apple and go for a walk, you know?

158
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,794
Why are you yelling at everybody else?

159
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,713
What the fuck are you giving me shit for?

160
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,924
All right? You put the cookies in there!

161
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,008
I didn't!

162
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,511
How is this my problem?

163
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,016
Jesus Christ! You ate your way in,
you can walk your way out.

164
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:58,979
All right?
And just slowly start shedding the pounds.

165
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,898
Shove some fucking lettuce in there

166
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,483
instead of a bunch of Ho Hos

167
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,443
and it's gonna come down,

168
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,529
and then you're
on my side of the fence, right?

169
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,155
Join me. Come on, say it with me.

170
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,866
Shame! Shame!

171
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:13,618
Right?

172
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,539
I know you're not supposed to shame.

173
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,249
You're not supposed to fat-shame,

174
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,084
you're not supposed to slut-shame.

175
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,211
They're, like, shaming shaming.

176
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,131
People aren't supposed to walk around
with any shame.

177
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,718
It's a legitimate human emotion,
but you're not supposed to feel it at all.

178
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,345
You're supposed to just walk around
like a dictator.

179
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,015
You're not gonna feel any shame?
You've never felt shame?

180
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,976
You never had such a bad fucking night,
the next morning, you woke up,

181
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,602
you couldn't even look in the mirror?

182
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,312
When you brush your teeth, you looked up.

183
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,606
You're like, "Oh,
you fucking piece of shit.

184
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,191
Wow! Wow!

185
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,277
Even for you, that was bad.

186
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,195
Lights out, curtains drawn,

187
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,072
until at least two in the afternoon,

188
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,741
before I can even look at you,

189
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,743
you fucking piece of shit!"

190
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,163
Yeah, you're supposed to have no shame?

191
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,539
That's the new world?

192
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,916
You're just gonna walk around,
sucking dick,

193
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,460
you know, eating cookies,

194
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,254
and just show up,
and nobody's supposed to say anything?

195
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,839
No one's supposed to have an opinion?

196
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,425
"Well, that's gonna go off the rails
pretty soon."

197
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,722
I know, it's probably mean
to do this stuff,

198
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,183
but, like, you can only have
so much sympathy.

199
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,727
There's so much stuff you can care about.

200
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,022
You know what happened to me that changed
my life? I did a gig in India. Right?

201
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:27,650
Unbelievably great people, but some
of the stuff I saw, I'll never forget.

202
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,235
Literally, I did a gig in India,

203
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,614
I saw a toddler take a shit
between two parked cars,

204
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,575
walked away, no pants or parents,

205
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,660
and then disappeared into the crowd

206
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:38,995
like Hannibal Lecter

207
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,081
at the end of <i>Silence Of The Lambs</i>.

208
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,377
It's one of the most heartbreaking things
I've ever seen in my life.

209
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,838
And then I come back to my country
and it's like,

210
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,176
"The studio said I have to lose 15 pounds
to star in a movie."

211
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,512
Well, then start running, you fat fuck!

212
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,889
That's your big complaint in life?

213
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,311
You know what it is about these fatties?

214
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,813
Do you know what it really is?

215
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,232
They have no respect

216
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,527
for the amount of sacrifice
and dedication it takes

217
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,988
to truly get in, like,
magazine-level shape, which is the...

218
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,323
You ever try to get abs?

219
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,618
You ever tried to get all the abs
down here? You ever tried to do it?

220
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,161
It's fucking impossible!

221
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,288
Past the age of 19,

222
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,916
you can't do it without tons of help.

223
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,211
You've got to buy all these exercise
tapes, you've got to read about nutrition,

224
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,172
you've got to get a personal trainer
having you fucking running along.

225
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,341
You need your own chef.

226
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,719
"Okay, don't eat it yet.
All right, now eat it. Start consuming it.

227
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,181
All right, stop. Slow down.
Stop. Stop. Spit it out! Spit it out!

228
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,350
I told you to stop!

229
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,228
Get on the elliptical!
You liked that Brussels sprout?!

230
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,814
Did you like that?!
'Cause now you're paying for it!"

231
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,608
It's a fucking miserable experience.

232
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:53,945
Just walking around
and your whole body's eating yourself.

233
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,155
"Do you want some cake?"

234
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,824
"No. No, I'll just take a salad.

235
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,493
Balsamic vinaigrette on the side.

236
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,744
No croutons.

237
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,706
Oh, my God! When is the photo shoot?

238
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,249
I want to kill myself."

239
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,293
It's horrible.

240
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,087
Have you ever tried to get fat?

241
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,715
No.

242
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,091
You don't have to.

243
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,301
It's effortless.

244
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,262
You can fucking lay on your back,

245
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,347
watching your favorite show,

246
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,933
just shoveling shit down your throat.

247
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,270
"What are you doing?"
"I'm getting fat. I'm getting fat."

248
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,607
"You got a trainer?"
"Don't need one. It's natural.

249
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,611
I just eat everything
that makes my sugar/salt go like,

250
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,695
'Yeah!

251
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,654
Whoo!

252
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,739
Yeah!'

253
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,409
It comes right in,
a nice roll of fucking flab."

254
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,122
No, it's ridiculous. I know nobody wants
to be fat, so I'm not shitting on anyone.

255
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,583
But don't fucking come at me
like it's my problem,

256
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,418
and I need to fucking rewire myself.

257
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,378
No. You're overweight, okay?

258
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,380
There's plenty of things
that can help you out.

259
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,593
Everybody's got something to deal with.
I'm a fucking lunatic with my temper.

260
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,179
This is something I have to deal with.
I do. You know?

261
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,681
You, you can't fucking stop eating
pork chops.

262
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,433
That's something you fucking deal with.

263
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,560
I don't have to completely rewire myself.

264
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,689
You know, it's just a bunch of sixes

265
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,609
pissed off that they're not
getting treated like a ten, you know?

266
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:18,071
At some point, you've just got
to acknowledge what you are.

267
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,114
You're a six. I'm sorry, all right?

268
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,992
Nobody jerks off to a six.
That's the deal.

269
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,912
Unless you work with her.

270
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,331
If you work with her, you know,
she's got that one outfit,

271
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,083
you know, it just does something for you.

272
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,710
You work in close quarters,

273
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:35,088
so you know what her shampoo smells like.

274
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,465
There's an intimacy.
There's an intimacy there.

275
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,549
All right?

276
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:45,264
I don't know what women rub one out to,
but I know it ain't me!

277
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,642
All right? This is a fantasy.

278
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,436
That's why I don't feel bad
about trashing 'em.

279
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,982
It's like, yeah, this is all coming
from... I'm a strong five, all right?

280
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,943
That's where I am,
so I still feel like I'm punching up here.

281
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,027
You know?

282
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,905
Honestly, people,
I'm a bald red-headed male.

283
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,907
You don't think there's a glass ceiling

284
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,201
on the kinds of parts I can get
in Hollywood?

285
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,202
Really?

286
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,998
Do you think I'm ever gonna be the lead
in a romantic comedy?

287
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,710
That ain't happening,
even if I'm booking the movie.

288
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,253
I want to make the money back.

289
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,965
That's the thing, it's show business.

290
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:22,218
There's $1 million on this film, okay?
We're trying to make fucking money.

291
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,054
You just want to show up with
fucking crumbs on the side of your face?

292
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,432
Show up in shape,

293
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,642
looking as fuckable as possible,

294
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:30,935
know your lines.

295
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,980
Ready to work.
It's called being a professional, right?

296
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,278
Dude, Ben Stiller had abs
in <i>Meet The Parents</i>!

297
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,196
There was no reason for him to do that.

298
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,866
He just knew,
"I'm gonna take my fucking shirt off.

299
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,409
I don't want to get trashed."

300
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,411
He was shredded.

301
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,539
Yeah, go be a fucking postman.

302
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,374
I mean, I don't know what to tell you.

303
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,420
No, this is just the ramblings of someone

304
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,339
who's sliding into
the back nine of his life,

305
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,467
and I'm not understanding

306
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,844
half the shit that's going on, you know?

307
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,346
You know, one of the big things
that really made me feel old

308
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,807
was when McDonald's started making salads.

309
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,312
That literally ripped my heart out.
I'm like, "They're doing what?"

310
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,399
Now they have wraps
and they're doing all of this shit.

311
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,486
You know what it was?
Out-of-shape people complained to them.

312
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,446
"You don't have any healthy options."

313
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,656
It's like, "Dude, this is McDonald's!

314
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,075
This shit is poison!

315
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,952
Who the fuck comes here to get in shape?"

316
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,207
Whenever I get McDonald's,
I have a whole plan.

317
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,918
At my age, I'm 48 years old,
I know what I'm gonna order.

318
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,128
I'm gonna go in there,
it's gonna taste great.

319
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,881
Twenty minutes later,
I'm gonna want to kill myself.

320
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,884
And then I'm gonna go,
"I'm going to the gym tomorrow."

321
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,012
And no matter how much I say that,
I woke up the demon in me.

322
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,263
I woke up the demon,

323
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,974
and all that grease
is just coursing through my veins.

324
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,936
And no matter how much I want to go
to the gym, this other voice is going,

325
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:57,939
"Dude, get an Egg McMuffin.
Go down there and get an Egg McMuffin."

326
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,274
And I'm gonna sit up
like the Manchurian Candidate.

327
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,527
"We're going to McDonald's."

328
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,904
My in-shape voice is in the back, going,

329
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,365
"No! What are we doing?! Go to the gym!"

330
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,449
And I'm just...

331
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,452
gonna drive right down.

332
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,830
Right? I know what it is.

333
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,376
But somehow out-of-shape people
somehow made them--

334
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,919
They're to fucking blame.

335
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,880
They had to have healthy shit
'cause they're why everybody's fat.

336
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,215
How come they have to do it?

337
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,593
What about Ben & Jerry's? How come they
don't have to put kale in their ice cream?

338
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,304
Why is that?
"Oh, they're a couple of hippies, man.

339
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,390
They're, like, making ice cream."

340
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:35,601
They're going after big, bad McDonald's.
You know, it's just...

341
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,187
Who the fuck goes to McDonald's
to get in shape?

342
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,358
And don't give me that horseshit
that eating healthy is expensive.

343
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,195
It isn't. Go to a fucking supermarket.
They're throwing the vegetables at you.

344
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,739
"Here's celery.
Get it the fuck out of here!

345
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,784
Seventy cents!
Twenty-five cents for a banana!

346
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:55,663
Whatever the fuck you want!
Get it out of here... before it goes bad!"

347
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,877
No, it's fucked up. They somehow
convinced them that... You know?

348
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,547
"McDonald's is the reason
why I'm out of shape."

349
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,341
"I would have got a salad,

350
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,552
but you didn't have the option,
so I was like,

351
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,388
"Well, I guess I gotta get 52 Big Macs."

352
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,558
"Thanks a lot, McDonald's!"

353
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,018
It's like, "Dude, you're an adult.

354
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,812
It's not their job to babysit you.
They're a fucking business.

355
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,190
If you order 50 sandwiches,
they're gonna give it to you.

356
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,025
It's your job to not do it,

357
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,526
you fucking dope."

358
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,611
Right?

359
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,988
I know. Sorry.

360
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,157
I know.

361
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,286
Yeah.

362
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,455
Dude, McDonald's...

363
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,415
McDonald's exists for two reasons, okay?

364
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,834
It's for drunk people
and it's for children.

365
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,754
All right? That's what this thing is.
You know?

366
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,298
You're in your car,
your kids won't shut the hell up,

367
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,841
you go to the drive-through.

368
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,094
You go to the drive-through,
you get a couple of poison burgers,

369
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,763
you throw it down their throats.

370
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,390
Their little systems can't handle it.
They start...

371
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,977
They start nodding off.

372
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,191
And you're up front, you're bigger.
You can handle a bigger dose of poison.

373
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,317
Do you know what I mean?

374
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,779
Pop in your Def Leppard cassette
and you have a little moment for yourself.

375
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:11,989
Yeah.

376
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,199
That's what it's for.

377
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,827
It's for your kids
and it's for drunk people.

378
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,038
How many times have you driven out
to a bar going,

379
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,498
"I'm just gonna have one."

380
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,125
All of a sudden, you had, like, 11, right?

381
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,503
And you're hammered,
and you're thinking...

382
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,714
You know, but you're responsible.
You're drunk but you're responsible.

383
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,300
You're like, "Goddamn it,
I drove my car here tonight...

384
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,136
goddamn it, I'm driving it home."

385
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,555
All right?

386
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,183
"I'm not gonna burden this place
of business

387
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,352
by taking up a parking space

388
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,771
in this completely empty parking lot

389
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,523
for the next six hours."

390
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,902
Now, I am not advocating
drinking and driving,

391
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,988
but I will tell you,
there's nothing better

392
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,824
than when all your friends and family
know you're hammered...

393
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,410
There's nothing better
than that walk to the car.

394
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,494
It's incredible.

395
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,581
Women are screaming,
people tearing at your clothes.

396
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,374
You feel like you're in the Beatles.

397
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,334
"Oh, my God! No! Stop him!"

398
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,295
You're like, "No autographs.

399
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:09,088
I'm sorry. I have to go.

400
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,091
I'll be back. Just... get 'em off me!"

401
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,262
Then you get in the car

402
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,555
and everybody's screaming.

403
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,432
"Get in the fucking car!

404
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,809
You're fine!
I had the car eight years. I know...

405
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,144
I can almost see my house.

406
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,687
Just get in the fucking car.

407
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,107
You're gonna make the cops come!
Get in the fucking car.

408
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,191
I swear to God,

409
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,776
just get in the fucking car.

410
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,697
Oh, take your seat belt off,
you fucking Mary.

411
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,532
I'm going right down the street."

412
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,658
Right?

413
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,119
And then what happens?

414
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:44,040
You get out on the road, you realize
you're way more hammered than you thought.

415
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,625
Who was always there for you?

416
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,793
McDonald's with the drive-through.

417
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,254
The 24-hour drive-through.

418
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,756
You could just pull in

419
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,592
and hide in plain sight, right?

420
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,761
And that little sad traffic jam

421
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,263
of divorcees, shut-ins,

422
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:01,349
people who go to Comic-Con, right?

423
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,516
You just pull in...

424
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,769
and just stop.

425
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,270
You can take a little nap.

426
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,609
It's like...
"Thank you! Thank you! Right."

427
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,030
You'd pull around.
That's what it was all about.

428
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,323
And now, all of a sudden,

429
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,159
they're the reason
this country's out of shape, you know?

430
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,829
They've had McDonald's my whole life.
People weren't this fucking fat, right?

431
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,748
It's not their fault.
You can't pin it on 'em.

432
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,416
But McDonald's fucked up.

433
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,670
They fucked up, because they gave in
to out-of-shape people, and they said,

434
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,464
"All right, fine, it's our fault.
We'll start making salads."

435
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,924
And then they got on their heels.

436
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,093
They got on their heels,
everybody sensed it,

437
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,177
and now look at them.

438
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,931
Okay? Four or five years later,
now they got to make breakfast all day.

439
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,432
Right?

440
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,602
Because you know what happened.
All the potheads showed up.

441
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,230
"Hey, man,
if you're gonna make him a salad, like...

442
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,400
like, what if I want,
like, a breakfast thingy

443
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,610
and it's not breakfast? Like..."

444
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,905
"You're gonna hook him up,
but you're not gonna hook me up?

445
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,576
That's, like, food racism or something,
man. I just don't understand."

446
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:05,329
They're like,
"Fine! We'll start making breakfasts."

447
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,248
They just completely lost their way.

448
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,836
I swear to God, dude, if I was running
that corporation, this is what I would do.

449
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,713
I'd bring that clown back.

450
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,131
All right?

451
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,675
I'd bring the clown back, okay,

452
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,928
and I'd just have that thing just look
right down the barrel of the camera,

453
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,597
have a little bit of dry ice
in the background.

454
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,808
You come right in tight on his face.

455
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,061
He just looks right in the camera
and goes, "Look...

456
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,231
if you can't get your fat ass down here...

457
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,650
by 10:30 in the morning...

458
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,944
you're getting a burger."

459
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
"All right?"

460
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:44,660
"No. No.

461
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,704
The clown ain't finished!"

462
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,709
"I'm not making pancakes

463
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,377
at three o'clock in the afternoon

464
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,588
because you did blow all night
with your friends

465
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,299
and you're just getting
your shit together, all right?

466
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,509
Make no mistake, this is a burger joint.

467
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,261
It's always been a burger joint.

468
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,931
We did that breakfast thing as a favor.
We were just trying to freak out IHOP.

469
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,600
'Oh, we're doing it, too!

470
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:08,809
We're doing it, too!'

471
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,439
Your own mother won't make you pancakes
at three o'clock in the afternoon, okay?

472
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,818
So get your fat ass or your drugged-up
ass down here before 10:30.

473
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,153
We decide. It's our place.

474
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,530
We tell you what the fuck we're making,
all right?"

475
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,282
That's it.

476
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,785
Take him out,
then he pushes a kid on a swing.

477
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,495
Something nice.

478
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,331
So...

479
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,541
Anyways,
by the time this special comes out,

480
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,794
another election will have come and gone,

481
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:35,878
and it's just...

482
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,047
God knows who we picked.

483
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,841
It's another one, they're not gonna
fucking talk about anything.

484
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,053
The oceans are dying. They just said
the Great Barrier Reef is dead.

485
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,889
You know? Genetically altered food.

486
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,390
There's too many fucking people.

487
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,560
I don't even know... They're just talking
about a bunch of shit. You know?

488
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,104
Bruce has to drop a deuce.

489
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,648
Where is he gonna go?

490
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,651
Which bathroom should this guy use?
I don't give a shit.

491
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,069
This guy has enough money

492
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,614
to literally have a porta-potty rickshaw
running behind him.

493
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,036
How are you going to eliminate...

494
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,749
a couple billion fucking people?

495
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,045
Do you ever think about that shit?

496
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,259
You know, they never talk to us about it.
You know they do behind closed doors.

497
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,222
A bunch of creepy dudes all sitting around
some giant table.

498
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,975
Right? They probably talk about it then.

499
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,434
Just sitting down after, like...

500
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,812
"I trust everyone had their fun?"

501
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,360
"Let's get down to the task at hand.

502
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,116
There are over 7.5 billion people
on the planet.

503
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,160
We're running out of fresh water.

504
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,581
There won't be enough chicken...

505
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,541
to feed the others.

506
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:00,170
Does anyone here have any suggestions...

507
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,132
on how to eliminate the pressures

508
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,509
of the undesirables?"

509
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,054
"Ah, yes, you.

510
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,931
Number four.

511
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,892
You may speak."

512
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,313
"Well, you know, what uh...

513
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,399
What if we, like,
slowly cooked 'em at the airport?

514
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,067
You know?

515
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,154
Just throwing it out there.

516
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,115
What if you had
a revolving-door-looking thing,

517
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:31,744
you made 'em take their shoes off,
they got in and they stood up like that?

518
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,913
And you just radiate 'em
from head to toe...

519
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,083
once on the way out,
once on the way back."

520
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:39,668
"Oh, yes. Yes!

521
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,713
I like that. I like the sound of that.
And how would that work?

522
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,966
Would you have it on low at first,
sear them like a tuna steak?

523
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,510
They don't understand.
You let the children go.

524
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,971
We'll use them for slaves later, right?

525
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,723
No old people. They'll die soon.

526
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,600
Just people in the prime of their life.

527
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,186
And gradually, over the years,
you increase it

528
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,021
and they start frothing at the mouth.

529
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,483
They don't recognize their children.
The property comes back to us!"

530
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,236
"Oh.

531
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,657
I trust everyone at this table
flies private?"

532
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,999
Dude, my wife thinks I'm out of my mind
because I think shit like that.

533
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,461
But I think I'm right.

534
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,631
Dude, I know they think about it.

535
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:28,509
I know they think about it,
because I think about it.

536
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,178
Every time I land in a city
and it's two o'clock in the afternoon,

537
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:35,057
I'm just driving down the street and I'm
in the middle of a fucking traffic jam,

538
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,810
that inner Mussolini
comes out of me, right?

539
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,312
Like, "What are all these people doing
in my road?!

540
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,315
They must be eliminated!"

541
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,278
I don't know.
Like, how do you not fucking bring it up?

542
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:50,823
It's 'cause it would freak everybody out,
you know,

543
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:54,076
that you have to start
maybe taking some measures...

544
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,162
...to start thinning out the herd.

545
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,580
Do you feel that?

546
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,374
That's right. That's right, yeah.

547
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,668
And what do you think, dude?
You think you're gonna...

548
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,421
You think you're in
the fucking upper tier?

549
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,424
You're in the...
You're in the luxury boxes, yeah?

550
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,259
You spend a lot of time with yourself.

551
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,844
You're doing a lot of nodding.

552
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,345
"I like what I think.

553
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,055
I like what I think a lot.

554
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,391
What I think is the way it should be."

555
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,934
I understand what that's like.

556
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,520
I live this fucking isolated life, man.

557
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,313
I go on the road, I'm in green rooms,

558
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:25,107
and I just fucking, you know...

559
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,110
I'm just by myself all the time.
You slowly go fucking crazy.

560
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,613
I did a gig recently. I was in Ireland
and I was in the green room by myself.

561
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,158
I went to turn on the light.
It was one of those pull switches.

562
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,827
It wound up around itself,
looked like a little noose.

563
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,788
I immediately thought, "What if I
stuck my head in there and just..."

564
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:45,294
"...and just turn the lights out?"
literally and figuratively.

565
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,338
I was not thinking
about killing myself at all.

566
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,175
The second I thought,
"What if I just fucking did that?"

567
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,262
And then I looked in the mirror,
I caught my eye and we both laughed.

568
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,683
Yeah. I had this wonderful little moment
with myself.

569
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,727
No words needed to be spoken.

570
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,811
You know?

571
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:08,150
Yeah. So I think about the population
all the time, as you can tell.

572
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,152
On my specials,
I'm always talking about it.

573
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,905
I think I got the plan, 'cause I know--

574
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:16,575
No. Wait until you hear the plan first,
'cause a lot of people are gonna die.

575
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,496
Before you start hootin' and hollerin'.

576
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,333
Everybody thinks
they're gonna fucking make it, right?

577
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,586
This is how you do it.
Well, this is how I would do it.

578
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,005
First of all,
you've got to become a dictator, okay?

579
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,133
Because it's too late to be like,
"Hey, man, maybe just have a couple..."

580
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:34,218
It's too fucking late.

581
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,262
Someone's got to have the balls
to take out the sickle...

582
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,432
...and start chopping some heads.

583
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,810
So, here's my idea.

584
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,689
I become dictator. Obviously you've got
to murder everybody in power, right?

585
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,275
From the head
all the way down to their goldfish,

586
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:54,154
you've got to kill everyone in the family
so they don't come back for their revenge,

587
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:57,825
like in <i>Godfather II</i> or every karate movie
you've ever seen, right?

588
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,701
You've got to do it
the way the Russians did,

589
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,287
where you don't find the skulls
for 100 fucking years.

590
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,165
That's the way you do it.
Then you take control of the media.

591
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,125
I keep all of you guys media blacked out.

592
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,962
You don't know what's going on
unless I want you to know it, right?

593
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,714
Big pictures of me.
You've got to sing songs about me.

594
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,425
If there's no passion in it,
a black van pulls up

595
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,094
and you're never seen from again.

596
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,178
All right?

597
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:21,682
I figure three to six months of that,
everybody gets on the same page,

598
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,101
and that's when I'd start thinning it out.

599
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,647
This is how I would do it. I would just
start randomly sinking cruise ships.

600
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:33,777
Just hear me out. It's the way to go.

601
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,404
It's the way to go.

602
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,534
You get 2,500 to 3,000 people a whack.

603
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,288
And I think it's a really good mix
of people to get rid of.

604
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,999
You know?

605
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,042
Think about the kinds of people

606
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,460
that take a cruise.

607
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,672
These aren't forward thinkers.

608
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,048
These aren't seekers.

609
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:58,135
They're not pivotal to our survival.

610
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:02,347
You ever hear somebody
coming back from a cruise?

611
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,725
It's one of the worst stories
you're ever gonna hear.

612
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,852
Because they don't do shit.

613
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,397
They don't want to travel to another
country, interact with a new culture,

614
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,482
try to figure out the train system
or the money.

615
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:16,028
All they want to do
is just sit on a fucking boat.

616
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,072
Just drinking. That's all they want to do.

617
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:20,991
Right? Worst story you'll ever hear.

618
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,284
"Hey. How was your cruise?"

619
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,744
"Oh, it was great.

620
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,163
I was fucking laying there.

621
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,206
There was a DJ over here

622
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,001
on the one-and-the-two wooka-wooka thing.

623
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:31,919
Right?

624
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,546
And then they had this chocolate fountain.

625
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,423
It was like a fountain,

626
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:37,799
but it was chocolate!

627
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,719
And you stuck the toothpick in the food,

628
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,638
and you stuck it in the chocolate,

629
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,224
and you stuck it in your mouth."

630
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,684
Then, 'I want another drink!'

631
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,478
Then they bring it, you drink it,

632
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,562
it dribbles down

633
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,314
and it gathers in your navel.

634
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,649
You punch yourself...

635
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,734
to get it in your mouth."

636
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,529
Then, every day around noon,
we line up for lunch.

637
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,156
What's for lunch? We don't know.

638
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,741
We don't make decisions.

639
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,368
Whatever they give us.

640
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,329
I like all-inclusive,
you just have to think once.

641
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,957
Can I write that number
on this piece of paper?

642
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,125
All right, tell me where to go."

643
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:16,964
I'm telling you, if you guys
could just get past the humanity

644
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,382
of what I am suggesting...

645
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,760
If you could just get past it

646
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,346
and maybe lose a couple of friends
here or there...

647
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,516
I am telling you, you wouldn't miss them.

648
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,435
You know when you'd miss 'em?

649
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,062
When you went to a baseball game

650
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:35,941
and there wasn't those 100 people in the
upper deck trying to get the wave going.

651
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,442
Right?

652
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,531
You wouldn't have people getting mad
'cause someone's sitting during a song,

653
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,241
like, "That's offensive to me,

654
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,410
even though I don't know the issue!"

655
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,661
Right?

656
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,830
Nashville, a little pull back on that one.

657
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,914
A little pull back.

658
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:55,585
It's about police brutality.

659
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,131
It has nothing to do with you and your
beautiful white world, and mine, right?

660
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,593
Just let it go. I don't give a fuck if you
watched every episode of <i>McHale's Navy</i>.

661
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:05,053
This is still not about you.

662
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,596
It's not a military issue.

663
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,979
I'm telling you, you wouldn't fucking
miss 'em. And this is the deal, all right?

664
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,773
I wouldn't just give the order
to start sinking these cruise ships

665
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,901
and then retire to my chambers
with my mistresses and my whores.

666
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,236
Right?

667
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,031
Just banging away,
wearing the whole uniform.

668
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:25,490
The whole dictator uniform.

669
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,659
Everything except for the pants. Right?

670
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,495
Compression socks with sock garters,

671
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:31,747
just banging away.

672
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,834
My honorary medals
just clanging off my chest.

673
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,254
The big thing is to see how long
I could fuck and keep the hat on.

674
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:41,757
Like, "Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!"

675
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,969
No, you can't do that.
That brings resentment amongst your men.

676
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,221
You've got to lead them into battle,
and I would.

677
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:51,308
I would. I'd have my own sub. All right?

678
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,517
I'd have my own sub

679
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:55,270
and I would hunt these cruise ships
on a moonlit summer night.

680
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,192
That's right. On a moonlit summer night,
when sound carries.

681
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:03,653
You know, those summer nights
when your neighbor's talking about you.

682
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,157
He doesn't think you can hear him.
You're on your porch. "Is that how it is?"

683
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,701
"So that's how it is, right?"

684
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,244
One of those nights.

685
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,625
And I'd be a sport about it.
I'd surface before I did it.

686
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,127
I'm armed, they're not.
It's only fair, right?

687
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,922
If they see me,
I give them a little wink, a little nod.

688
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,883
I'd have a little Red Baron class.
"All right, get the fuck out of here."

689
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,636
Right? But if you didn't see me,
it would be game on.

690
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,096
And every moonlit summer night,

691
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:30,972
every summer I would go out to harvest.

692
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,933
That would be the deal.
I would just surface.

693
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,611
"And listen for the music, yeah?"

694
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,254
"Fire one."

695
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,517
"Dude, look at my arms in this tank top."

696
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,446
And then you cruise over,

697
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,114
you strafe all the survivors.

698
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:41,918
"Bring it around!"

699
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:57,767
That would be it.

700
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:02,272
Twenty-five hundred to 3,000 less people.
And you know what's the greatest thing?

701
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,607
It's all underwater.

702
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,485
All the evidence is gone.
All the evidence is gone.

703
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:09,738
Every mass murderer throughout time
has fucked up.

704
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,072
They did it on land.

705
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,200
You're gonna get caught.

706
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,118
Where are you gonna put
all of that, right?

707
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,870
You do it out to sea.

708
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,955
It all goes under, you know?

709
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,999
Nobody knows. "I don't know what happened.

710
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,292
I have no idea."

711
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,169
No evidence.

712
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:27,422
No evidence. Maybe...
Maybe, like, a flip-flop, right?

713
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,676
Like an Ed Hardy shirt just...

714
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,386
floating by.

715
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:37,766
I'm controlling the media
and nobody knows about it, right?

716
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,975
And as I sank the ships,

717
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,437
I would be building exact replicas
at the same time, right?

718
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,815
So I'd be eliminating people
while creating jobs.

719
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,193
You guys have no fucking idea
what's going on.

720
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,446
All of you just realize, like,
"Wow, man, the traffic's easing up.

721
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,783
I'm getting into third gear
at five o'clock at night. This is crazy!

722
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,328
I don't know what's going on,
but this Bill guy's all right.

723
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,207
Another buddy of mine got a job building
ships. Can you fucking believe that?

724
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,167
That industry, it's just blowing up.

725
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,710
It's crazy.

726
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,963
Dude, I want to get a job down there.
They pay great.

727
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,299
You know, make a little extra money.
Who knows? Maybe you and me take a cruise.

728
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,260
We'd have a good time, right?
Get out there."

729
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,887
That's how it would work.

730
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:19,140
That's how my ethnic cleansing would work.

731
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:25,105
It wouldn't be based on race or religion.

732
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,274
It would just be based on
people dumb enough

733
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,360
to think that taking a cruise
is actually travelling.

734
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:34,239
Technically, you're travelling,
but what are you seeing?

735
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:36,491
Just a bunch... "Look at the water!

736
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,576
Oh, my God!

737
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,327
You can tell that's the Atlantic Ocean.

738
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,746
That definitely does not look like
the Pacific Ocean."

739
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,208
So...

740
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,836
Yeah, look, admittedly,
I'm a fucking psycho.

741
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,296
And uh...

742
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,006
Oh, yeah. Dude, I have dreams...

743
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,217
I had a dream two years ago
that still haunts me. You know?

744
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:57,387
You ever have one of those dreams
where you think you woke up but didn't?

745
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,807
You're just sitting up and it feels
like... I had one of those dreams, right?

746
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,976
So I just sat up in bed,
and I looked over,

747
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,686
and there was a little girl in the corner.

748
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,230
No idea who she was.
She was, like, three, four years old.

749
00:35:07,314 --> 00:35:10,609
And she was talking to me, but I couldn't
understand what she was saying.

750
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,319
She was standing in the corner, going...

751
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,115
I was like, "What?"

752
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,784
"What did you say? I...

753
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,329
I can't hear you, sweetheart.
You've got to come closer."

754
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:25,040
She walked halfway to the bed.
She was nodding her head, going...

755
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,712
Big, like, <i>The Grudge</i> eyes. I'm just...

756
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,923
"You've got to come closer."
She walks up to the bed.

757
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,801
I was like, "I couldn't hear you,
sweetheart. What did you say?"

758
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:38,386
And she just nods and just goes,

759
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,055
"You're gonna kill yourself."

760
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:41,848
I just sat up, like...

761
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:45,143
I'm like, "No, I'm not!

762
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,354
No, I am not!"

763
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,980
My wife wakes up. "What's the matter?"

764
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,275
"I just had the most scary dream I've ever
had in my life! It was horrible!"

765
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,902
She's like, "Was I in it?"

766
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,863
"No, you self-centered jackass!

767
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,074
Jesus Christ!

768
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,117
Not everything is about you, sweetheart.

769
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,496
I love you, but it's not all about you.
Now, shut up. I'm gonna..."

770
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,831
I tried to go to sleep
in the same position

771
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,000
so I'd run into that little girl again,
so I could,

772
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:12,003
"Look, you little shit, you don't
go around saying that to people!"

773
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:15,507
Now, I'm not gonna kill myself.

774
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:19,386
I don't know what that dream meant,
because you dream in metaphors, man.

775
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,595
You know? I don't know.

776
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,806
It just freaks me out, though, you know?

777
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,724
It disturbs my wife and shit.

778
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:27,185
But there is one good thing about
being a psycho.

779
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,145
You know,
a great thing about being a psycho

780
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,481
is you can spot another psycho

781
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,857
from a mile away.

782
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,859
You know? That's a really great thing.

783
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,987
I can spot 'em.
You know, it's in the eyes.

784
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,531
Never look at the costume.

785
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,033
Nice people look at the costume.

786
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,369
They'll see somebody in, like, dad jeans,

787
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,371
you know, pushing their kid on the swing,

788
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,706
the whole nerdy sweater.

789
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,957
"Hey! How are you doing?

790
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,877
Can you believe the summer's already over?
I mean, this is crazy, right?

791
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:56,297
Oh, this one here
has got me running around, you know?

792
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,550
She's running the house!
She's running the house."

793
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,097
People are always like,
"Oh, my God. He's so nice.

794
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,390
Such a great family man."

795
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,144
And I'm just sitting, thinking in my head,
dude, that guy is a fucking psycho!

796
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,228
He's a psycho!

797
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,647
Look at his eyes. You don't see that?

798
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,691
That dude is barely hanging on!

799
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:18,194
He is white-knuckling it through all
the shit he thinks he's supposed to do.

800
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:20,238
All that fucking guy needs, all he needs,

801
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:21,906
he just needs a little nudge.

802
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,867
That's it, just a little nudge.

803
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,119
You have no idea
what that guy's capable of.

804
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:29,956
I would not want to see the hard drive
of that man's computer, I'm telling you.

805
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,961
Yeah, so I do it all the time.

806
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,006
I'm pretty good at picking out psychos,
and it drives my wife nuts.

807
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,050
I remember she was one of the first people
that got into Kanye West, right?

808
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:43,595
The great Kanye West.
Everybody loves him and stuff, right?

809
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,264
Oh, shut up. Jesus Christ.
Why did I come to Nashville?

810
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,682
"Boo! It's a black artist!

811
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,392
You're bringing it up in the Ryman.

812
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:50,602
What the fuck?

813
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,270
It's the Grand Ole Opry, man!

814
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,939
It's not MTV Raps!"

815
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,109
But I'm stereotyping you.

816
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,612
I'm acting like 'cause you're
from the South, you're racists,

817
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,781
like all the racists are just down here.

818
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,867
That isn't true.
You know, they're all over the place.

819
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,163
It's just different degrees.

820
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,040
Right?

821
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,336
Like, me, I'm racist, like,
at the end of the day.

822
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,421
Like, I'm a great fucking guy,

823
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,507
I don't give a shit who you are
in the morning.

824
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,176
You're eating your cereal.
"Hey! How are you? What's going on?"

825
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,678
But as the sun starts to go down

826
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,639
and the fear starts coming up,

827
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,183
that's when you start thinking
the worst of people, right?

828
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,436
I know, nobody's gonna be honest.

829
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,939
I don't give a fuck who you are.

830
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,106
Twelve, midnight,

831
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:39,108
in a parking garage by yourself,

832
00:38:39,192 --> 00:38:40,693
whatever is walking at you,

833
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,070
there's no happy thoughts.

834
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,864
You're not thinking, "Oh, that guy,

835
00:38:44,948 --> 00:38:47,951
he's probably uh...
he's probably building a website and..."

836
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,327
You're not thinking that.

837
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,121
That dude's gonna cut me up, eat me.

838
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,458
Whatever he doesn't eat, he's gonna fuck.
That is what you think, right?

839
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,585
All right?

840
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:00,964
But if you do that at night,
that's normal, I think, because it's fear.

841
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,509
It's the people at breakfast
that are already just sitting there, like,

842
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,718
"Fucking Jews!"

843
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:07,554
You know, that's when you've got an issue.

844
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,473
So...

845
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:13,893
So, anyway... I've just got to do this.

846
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:17,063
When you talk about race and that shit
as a white dude, you've got to go easy.

847
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,525
You know, because very easily it starts
feeling like a meeting. You know?

848
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,444
Whenever I start hearing, like,
"Yeah! All right! Whoo!"

849
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,115
That's when I go, "I've got to pull back.
People aren't seeing what I'm saying.

850
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,449
I wore a country shirt.

851
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,286
Things are getting
a little off the rails here."

852
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,371
Can I get back to Kanye West?

853
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:36,708
Half of you have probably downloaded his
shit. All right? All right, here we go.

854
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:41,170
So, my wife got freaked out because...
Early on, she was loving the guy.

855
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,215
And I was thinking he was cool.
Then, one day, I saw him do an interview.

856
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,175
He was talking shit
about how great he was,

857
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:49,554
and there was just this look that was
in his eye, and it just made me nervous.

858
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,347
I'm like, "Dude, this guy is uh...

859
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,641
This guy is, like...
This guy is volatile, man.

860
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,311
There's something with this guy.
He's making me nervous.

861
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,607
This guy is, like, right on the edge of,
like, snapping, right?"

862
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,191
She goes, "You're out of your mind."

863
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:04,736
I was thinking, "I don't know.
I think this guy is fucked up."

864
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:07,071
Then I was convinced,
because one day I came walking in,

865
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:09,991
she was listening to him do an interview,
and I didn't know it was him.

866
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,993
He was talking about how great he was,

867
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,495
and I came walking in,
and all I did was hear this shit.

868
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,790
And, like, literally,
a chill ran down my spine,

869
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:21,002
and I just started thinking,
like, "No! No! No!"

870
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,253
And I turned, and I looked.

871
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:24,172
Before it even registered
that it was Kanye,

872
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,299
my first thought was, "Oh, thank God.

873
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,468
Oh, thank God. It's just a black guy."

874
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,097
"Thank God!

875
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,642
It's just a black guy."

876
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:38,269
Yeah, I know, you're right to pull back.

877
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,106
It's right to get awkward,
you don't know where this could go.

878
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,527
This could very easily go
in a Klan-ish direction, okay?

879
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,489
So just let me clarify.

880
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,573
Just hear me out.

881
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,825
I'm thinking,
"Thank God it's a black guy,"

882
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:56,204
meaning,
"Thank God that ego that is in him..."

883
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,706
When that thing floated down
from the heavens,

884
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,999
or the cosmos,

885
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,002
whatever the hell Joel Osteen shit
you believe...

886
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:04,420
All right?

887
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,299
When that thing was floating down,
it could have landed in anybody.

888
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,384
Thank God...

889
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,594
it landed in a black guy.

890
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,013
Thank God it got wrapped up in that,

891
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:15,723
trapped within that.

892
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,642
It's safe in there.

893
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:21,646
No reason to worry when it's in there,

894
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:25,692
because if that ego, however,
had floated down...

895
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,194
and landed in a blue-eyed white dude,

896
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:31,698
there is no telling
the damage that could have been done.

897
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,368
You're talking
entire civilizations wiped out...

898
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:37,578
worldwide famine,

899
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,706
the moon colliding with the Earth.

900
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,543
Thank God that ego landed in a black guy.

901
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:49,048
Because he's just as nuts as some of
the craziest white dudes of all time,

902
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:51,134
he just doesn't have the opportunity

903
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,219
to follow through with the madness.

904
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,723
Right?
Yeah, there's a glass ceiling on evil.

905
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,850
You never noticed that?

906
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:02,895
Dude, go home, put on the History channel.

907
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,856
Like, the top nine out of ten

908
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,025
most batshit-crazy dudes

909
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,443
who ever walked the earth

910
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,028
are all white dudes.

911
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:13,406
Now, why is that? Because white dudes
are more evil than anybody else?

912
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,615
It's a possibility.

913
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,909
It's a possibility.

914
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:18,536
We've definitely got the numbers.

915
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:21,581
But I think it's different.

916
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,625
You know what it is?
Nobody's watching white dudes. Right?

917
00:42:24,709 --> 00:42:27,170
White dudes, too many of 'em gather
and somebody pulls up,

918
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,130
"All right, break it up! Keep it moving!

919
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,631
Get out of here!"

920
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,801
Getting pulled over for no fucking reason,
none of that shit.

921
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,803
You're a white dude.
It's just an open field.

922
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,014
Anything you think,
"Hey, I'm gonna do that."

923
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,141
No one's stopping you. You just...

924
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,434
You just start running.

925
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,353
Next thing you know,
you're handing out buttons,

926
00:42:44,437 --> 00:42:45,897
you've got your own uniform.

927
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,691
You're starting a fucking war, right?

928
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:51,903
All Kanye West is allowed to do

929
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,529
is fuck up an award show

930
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,073
every three to four years.

931
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:59,911
Make a public service announcement
a little awkward for Mike Myers.

932
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,789
That's as far as he's ever gonna get.

933
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,086
I know, I know. You don't believe me.

934
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,295
Dude, okay,

935
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,380
next time Kanye's going off on himself,

936
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:13,925
I'm telling you,
just close your eyes, forget it's him

937
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,470
and really listen
to what is coming out of this guy's mouth.

938
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,597
He says shit like, "I'm a genius."

939
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:21,974
"I'm a god. I'm Shakespeare."

940
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,437
"My biggest regret is I'll never get
to see myself perform live."

941
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,482
That's a direct quote.

942
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,861
"My biggest regret is I'll never get
to see myself perform live."

943
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,155
Dude, you put that ego in a white dude,
then it's...

944
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,828
"...and the blitzkrieg,
and the superior race!"

945
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,708
"Vienna will return to Deutschland first!"

946
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,757
No, I'm telling you. But we're okay.

947
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,843
We're okay. It's in a black guy.

948
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,637
Nothing's gonna happen.

949
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,140
You never noticed that shit?

950
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,268
Crazy black guys, as far as they can get,

951
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,520
they can just freak people out
in the subway.

952
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:11,232
They can stand on a street corner
with their book and their friends,

953
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,692
just yelling about white people.

954
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,901
"These people got tails!

955
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,862
The motherfuckers got tails!
They're evil!"

956
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,238
You just cross the street.

957
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,739
That's it.

958
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:24,412
In a perfect world, Hitler never would
have made it past the subway level.

959
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,455
That's as far as he ever would have got.

960
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:29,834
You would have been on the train.
"What are you gonna do tonight?"

961
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,502
"Play a little fantasy football."

962
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,754
The door would just open.
He'd come walking through.

963
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,799
"And they should have
the blue eyes and the blonde hair,

964
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,467
and the pubes like the sun!"

965
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,888
And you're just sitting there.
"Just ignore him. Let him pass through.

966
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:42,972
Let him pass through."

967
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:45,391
And he'd just walk into the other part
of the train.

968
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,477
Literally, a world war
just passing through.

969
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,688
But he was a white dude,

970
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,232
no one watched him
and his hair was flopping around,

971
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:54,817
and nobody gave a fuck.

972
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:55,902
All right?

973
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,572
So that's kind of like the weird lesson...

974
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,366
that I learned with Kanye West.

975
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:04,452
You know?

976
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,582
Like, every once in a while, racism works.

977
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,378
Like, 99.9 per cent of the time,

978
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,297
it's the ugliest thing we do
to one another,

979
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,257
but every once in a while we get lucky

980
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:21,344
and that marble,
it just rolls into the right hole

981
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,678
and we get off easy.

982
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,015
We got off easy with that guy.

983
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,520
I've got to commend you guys.
You did well with the Hitler reference.

984
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,147
You did all right.

985
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,232
Nothing quiets a room

986
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,984
like dropping the H-bomb.

987
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:42,114
You bring up Adolf Hitler,
it gets fucking quiet, to this day.

988
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,575
This dude, fucking, he died, like, what,

989
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,994
75 fucking years ago, allegedly.

990
00:45:47,078 --> 00:45:48,621
You know?

991
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,748
Some think he went down
to South America...

992
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,667
"And why are they so brown?"

993
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,293
...for the rest of his life.

994
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,754
At this point, even if he lived,
he's fucking dead, right?

995
00:45:58,631 --> 00:45:59,840
We can go with that, right?

996
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,970
But still, to this day, though,

997
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:06,222
even though he died
let's say 75-fucking-years ago,

998
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,932
he's still the benchmark for evil.

999
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,059
Have you ever noticed that?
He is the reference.

1000
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,437
Any time you want to say somebody's evil,
you just say, "He is the next Hitler."

1001
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,857
"Donald Trump, he's the next Hitler."
"Saddam Hussein, he's the next Hitler."

1002
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,110
It's always, "He's the next Hitler," okay?

1003
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,863
I don't know what the fuck they used
to say before Hitler came around, right?

1004
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:25,574
"He's the next Genghis Khan."

1005
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:26,742
"He's the next Napoleon."

1006
00:46:26,826 --> 00:46:29,286
I don't know, Ivan the Terrible.
I don't know what they said.

1007
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,706
But whatever they used to say,
he wiped them all out.

1008
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,791
He was so fucked up,

1009
00:46:33,874 --> 00:46:36,419
it's like what they did
didn't even exist any more.

1010
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,839
All right? It's like when Michael Jordan
came into the NBA.

1011
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,133
He was so fucking good...

1012
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,343
he wiped out everyone.

1013
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,054
No one ever goes, "He's the next Dr. J."

1014
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,098
"He's the next Wilt." No one says that.

1015
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,100
It's always, "He's the next Mike."

1016
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:52,018
Right?

1017
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,938
Adolf Hitler
is the Michael Jordan of evil.

1018
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:58,733
He is.

1019
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:03,946
Like, Nike literally should have made him
a sneaker, like a giant fucking boot.

1020
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:07,241
You know, it's all stiff around your knees
so you get that walk going down.

1021
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:08,743
Right?

1022
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:12,038
Like, if there was an evil hall of fame,

1023
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:13,622
you've got to put Hitler in.

1024
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,709
He's first-ballot hall-of-fame evil.

1025
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,794
Okay? Undeniable stats.

1026
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,630
He's got the career numbers. You know?

1027
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,674
Six to nine million dingers,

1028
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:24,842
you're getting in.

1029
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,470
You're getting in.

1030
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,223
People, its a sports analogy.

1031
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:33,642
I'm not advocating what the man did.

1032
00:47:33,726 --> 00:47:36,520
Can we all be adults here? All right?

1033
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:40,775
Am I gonna be on a split screen
tomorrow morning with some blogger?

1034
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,736
On some <i>Good Morning, Nashville</i> show.

1035
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,031
"Comedy: Can it go too far?

1036
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,949
Last night at the Ryman Theater..."

1037
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,786
"...making fun of fat people,

1038
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:53,829
sinking cruise ships was all fine.

1039
00:47:53,913 --> 00:47:56,082
Suddenly, it took a horrible,

1040
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,458
horrible turn.

1041
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:01,462
Fortunately,
local blogger Maggie Maggenhall

1042
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,755
was on the scene.

1043
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,632
Maggie, can you describe

1044
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,634
what you were subjected to...

1045
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,012
during last night's horrible rant?"

1046
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:14,850
"Well, first of all, everybody that knows
me knows I have a great sense of humor.

1047
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,143
I think this is funny,

1048
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:17,478
I think that is funny,

1049
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,314
but that, last night, that was not funny."

1050
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,359
It always goes down like that.

1051
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,860
They always have to establish

1052
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,238
what a wonderful sense of humor they have.

1053
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,658
No, it's a sports analogy.

1054
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,326
Okay?

1055
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:35,121
Six to nine million.
He got all of that one!

1056
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,748
He had power from both sides of the plate.

1057
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,875
He'd have his own fucking wing.

1058
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,753
Okay?
But this is what kills me about Hitler.

1059
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:44,338
Killed six to nine million people.

1060
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,758
Meanwhile, Stalin killed 20 to 25 million,

1061
00:48:47,842 --> 00:48:50,594
basically over the exact same period,
okay?

1062
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,388
Yet, he cannot get arrested

1063
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,016
in the conversation of most
fucked-up dude who ever walked the planet.

1064
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,561
It's always, "He's the next Hitler.
He's the next Hitler."

1065
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,105
Well, how many fucking people
do you have to kill

1066
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,731
just to get a little shout-out,

1067
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,108
a little tip of the cap?

1068
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,027
"What do you think of this guy?"
"He's the next Hitler."

1069
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,947
How about, every once in a while,
"This guy's a little Stalin-esque"?

1070
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,491
"I see a little Jo-Jo in this guy." Right?

1071
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,662
He almost tripled his fucking numbers.

1072
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,790
He gets brought up like he was a backup!

1073
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,420
Why don't his kills count?

1074
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,796
Does anybody...

1075
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,382
Anybody, why doesn't his fucking kills
count? I don't get it.

1076
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,218
Is it because he just looked like
some regular guy, your neighbor?

1077
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,345
You know, driving a little John Deere.

1078
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:35,681
"I just killed a million Ukrainians."

1079
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,766
He just drives around his yard.

1080
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,435
Is that what it is?

1081
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,231
I think it is. Hitler just...
I don't know, he just looked the part.

1082
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,275
He's like... From central casting,

1083
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,485
you couldn't pick
a more evil-looking dude.

1084
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,029
Like, go home tonight,

1085
00:49:50,112 --> 00:49:51,822
google pictures of Adolf Hitler.

1086
00:49:51,906 --> 00:49:55,576
Get put on the same watch list
that I'm on, all right?

1087
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:01,916
I'm telling you, there's not one
cute picture of that guy his whole life.

1088
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,500
It's just all pure evil.

1089
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,003
There's no, like, teenage boy-band years,
like...

1090
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:11,008
You google a picture of Adolf as a baby.

1091
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:14,845
You look at that thing, you're like,
"Dude, drown that fucking thing! Drown it!

1092
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,181
Take it down to the river,
stick it under a rock.

1093
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,434
If you don't do it, I'm gonna fucking
do it. I swear to God, it's looking at me.

1094
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,603
I would kick it right in its baby chest...

1095
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,022
and feel no guilt whatsoever."

1096
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,275
Dude, Hitler is actually so evil,

1097
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,778
he actually makes me want to learn how
to speak German.

1098
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,196
You know what I mean?

1099
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,991
I just want to know, what the fuck was he
saying to those people? Every speech.

1100
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:39,870
He's so clearly out of his fucking mind.

1101
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,538
It's got to be what he's saying.

1102
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,916
What the fuck did he say?

1103
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,252
There's no way he said

1104
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,754
what he planned on doing from the get-go.

1105
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,714
Some unknown candidate,

1106
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:52,591
right, early on...

1107
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,054
"Okay, our next speaker coming
to the stage..."

1108
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,432
"...to possibly run Deutschland

1109
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,476
for the foreseeable future.

1110
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,853
His name is um...

1111
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,648
Oh, dear. I left my glasses backstage.

1112
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,775
Is that Alan? Is it Alan?

1113
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,611
Oh, Adolf. Adolf, okay.

1114
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,154
Oh, okay, okay.

1115
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,782
Whoa. This guy's got a bee in his bonnet.

1116
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,619
Okay, please welcome Adolf Hitler.
You got three minutes, buddy."

1117
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,913
"And I'm going to kill millions of people!

1118
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:26,125
I know what they should look like--
the eyeballs a centimeter apart!

1119
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:28,294
I have the outfits
for the rest of the people!"

1120
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,171
Dude, you can't come out of the gates...

1121
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:33,424
talking to a crowd like that.

1122
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,719
You're gonna freak 'em out.
You can't go that hard in the beginning.

1123
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:40,723
You know? You can do that in the woods
with a couple of drinking buddies.

1124
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,602
Freaking people out. "Hey, Matt, relax.
There's girls here. Jesus Christ."

1125
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,816
"I think I've got a shot here. I'm trying
to get laid. Can you just be a wingman?

1126
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,901
For once in your life,
dude, can you just be a...

1127
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:56,989
Just bring the energy down. Nobody gives
a fuck about your fucking theories, okay?

1128
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,742
Just be a chill guy.
You've got shit on your mouth.

1129
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:02,119
Either grow a moustache or don't.
You look ridiculous.

1130
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:03,579
I'm sorry, ladies.

1131
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:05,039
He gets a little excited."

1132
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:08,792
What I think he was doing,

1133
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:12,046
I think he was just being
a crowd-pleasing hack, if I had to guess.

1134
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,673
He was telling Germans
what they wanted to hear.

1135
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:17,468
"And we have the best cars,
we have the best women.

1136
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,345
Oktoberfest is the shit!"

1137
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,430
He's just shooting free T-shirts up.

1138
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,517
Fucking armbands. Right?

1139
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,148
I don't know.
It's something that's always bothered me.

1140
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,233
Not always, just recently.

1141
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,694
If this guy kills six to fucking nine,
everybody's...

1142
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,364
we definitely don't want
another one of those.

1143
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,783
Well, what about this guy?
Twenty to fucking 25.

1144
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,451
You know?

1145
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:46,038
What it is, there's probably a couple
of egghead history majors going,

1146
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,707
"Well, Bill, if we're gonna go around
the world, you know,

1147
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,626
what about that dude Mao from China?

1148
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,671
He allegedly killed 50-60 million people.

1149
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,299
What about that guy?
How come you don't bring him up?"

1150
00:52:57,383 --> 00:52:59,426
Simple. I don't count those kills.

1151
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:04,473
I don't. I don't count 'em.

1152
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:08,936
Dude, there's, like,
a billion people in China.

1153
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:12,523
You wipeout on a scooter,
you're gonna kill 80 not even trying.

1154
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,067
Fifty to 60 million,

1155
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:17,736
that's like steroid-era stats.

1156
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:19,905
Like, get the fuck out of here.
What are you on?

1157
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,199
Come on.
Am I supposed to believe that number?

1158
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,202
That's like when a second baseman had,
like, 50 jacks.

1159
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:26,954
Dude, you had 20 in high school.

1160
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,915
Get the fuck out of here, 50 homeruns!

1161
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,002
I don't get it. I just don't get why...

1162
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:39,591
What I feel, whenever I do this bit,
I always feel the crowd,

1163
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:41,885
you guys just don't like a sports analogy.

1164
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,762
You know?

1165
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,266
Let's go music, all right?

1166
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,017
It's Nashville.

1167
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:52,062
We'll look at it in a musical way.
All right? Okay.

1168
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:53,981
Hitler drops an album.

1169
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,360
He sells six to nine million copies.

1170
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:02,030
All right? He's got a couple of
summertime jams, maybe a prom song.

1171
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:03,782
He just catches a moment.

1172
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,118
He has his own dance,
like "Gangnam Style,"

1173
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,078
except it's got a little more
with the hands.

1174
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,788
Right?

1175
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:11,415
It's more of an upper-body song.

1176
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,543
Then, later on that summer,

1177
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,420
Stalin drops his new shit.

1178
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:19,465
He sells 20-25 million copies.

1179
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:23,802
Twenty to 25 million copies
is Michael Jackson <i>Thriller</i>, okay?

1180
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,763
One of the greatest artists,
one of the greatest albums of all time.

1181
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,432
Six to nine million in sales,

1182
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,643
that's like Hootie & The Blowfish
<i>Cracked Rear View Mirror</i>.

1183
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,316
Now, if you guys were at home
in your apartment or your fucking barn,

1184
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:38,901
whatever it is you do down here...

1185
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:41,862
...sitting there with your lantern...

1186
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:45,657
and you're sound asleep...

1187
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:48,619
next to your favorite bale of hay.

1188
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,037
You're sound asleep...

1189
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,498
and someone runs in
at three in the morning.

1190
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:56,084
"Dude, run down to the bar! It's the next
Michael Jackson, I swear to God!"

1191
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:57,461
You would consider it.

1192
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,339
"Michael Jackson,
I've got to fucking see that."

1193
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,090
But if somebody woke you up, like,

1194
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:05,177
"Dude, you've got to see this guy!
He's the next Hootie & The Blowfish!"

1195
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,220
Right?

1196
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:09,890
You'd smash him over the head with your
fucking lantern, or whatever you've got.

1197
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,395
Why don't his fucking kills count?

1198
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:18,106
Dude, Stalin,
he even killed his own friends.

1199
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,567
Hitler didn't even do that.

1200
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:23,278
You go duck hunting with Stalin.
You thought you were in with him.

1201
00:55:23,362 --> 00:55:25,280
He's taking pictures with you and shit.

1202
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,866
It's all fucking good, right?

1203
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,453
Then, a week later, you parted your hair
a little bit different, he got paranoid,

1204
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,247
and that was it, he whacked you.

1205
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,331
That's it.

1206
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:37,709
Not only that, he then had you erased
out of the photo.

1207
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:41,296
You know? Next thing you know, Stalin's
hugging a tree or some shit like that.

1208
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:44,091
This guy was photoshopping people
out of photos...

1209
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,594
like, 60 years before
the technology existed.

1210
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:49,763
He changed the fucking game!

1211
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:57,646
Yeah. So, I watch
a lot of the YouTube videos, right?

1212
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:00,607
So, the other night, my wife,
lovely wife, she's falling asleep.

1213
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:04,278
I can't because I'm all scatterbrained,
so I just start watching YouTube clips.

1214
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:08,782
Okay? And I ended up seeing this clip
of this lady down at the zoo. All right?

1215
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,158
This lady down at the zoo,

1216
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:13,120
who I'm sure wasn't making as much money

1217
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,622
as the guy who worked at the zoo,

1218
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:18,000
and that's what needs to stop.

1219
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,131
Ladies, did you ever think
of opening your own zoo? You know?

1220
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,218
Is there a reason you wait until
we build the whole fucking thing,

1221
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,804
and then you show up
when all the hard work is done?

1222
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,389
All the animals are captured.

1223
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,142
"Hey, where's my fucking corner office?!"

1224
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,226
Yeah.

1225
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:38,812
Start your own fucking zoo!

1226
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,607
Go out and catch a cobra, see how that is.

1227
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,321
That's not the point of this story.
I just like...

1228
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,449
I just like being a dick sometimes.
So, this lady down at the zoo.

1229
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,454
This lady down at the zoo, she taught
this gorilla how to do sign language.

1230
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,998
Okay? And I don't just mean like "hello"
and "goodbye."

1231
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,333
Like, literally phrases.

1232
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,460
This thing could, like,
talk about its emotions.

1233
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,337
They were actually conversing.

1234
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,839
The gorilla is talking to her.
"Oh, my God. You look upset."

1235
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:08,258
"Oh, I'm kind of sad."
And they're just talking.

1236
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,844
So immediately, like,
my brain just went fucking crazy.

1237
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,388
I was like, "Oh, my God.
She's talking to a gorilla.

1238
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,099
I love gorillas.
Who wouldn't talk to a gorilla?"

1239
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,727
Without thinking that my wife is sleeping,
I just blurted out,

1240
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,604
"Ask it how much it can bench!

1241
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,106
Ask it how much it can bench!"

1242
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,151
My wife pops up. "What are you doing?"

1243
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,904
I'm like, "Look at this! Look!
She's talking to a gorilla!"

1244
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:31,615
And we both just got sucked
into this thing. Right?

1245
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,369
So, long story short,
she's talking to this gorilla,

1246
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,788
and one day she decides
to get it a little kitten.

1247
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,206
A little kitty cat, right?

1248
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:42,876
Immediately I'm thinking, like,
"Don't get it a cat! It's a gorilla."

1249
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,087
It's gonna twist the thing's head off,

1250
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,714
throw the body over there,
play with the head for a while.

1251
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,800
Sniffing it and stuff.

1252
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:53,345
And then, later, it's gonna walk over
and set the head down next to the body

1253
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,555
and wonder why the whole thing's
not getting up again.

1254
00:57:56,264 --> 00:57:58,684
Because it's a fucking gorilla.

1255
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:00,894
It's a wild animal.

1256
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:03,397
Wild animals don't have pets, right?

1257
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,899
It's kill or be killed out there.
That's it.

1258
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:08,944
They don't have little parakeets
on their shoulders and shit.

1259
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,154
But it was the exact opposite.

1260
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,531
She gives it this little kitten,

1261
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,491
and it immediately understood
it was a baby,

1262
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,410
and this, like, parental thing came over.

1263
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,287
It was so, like, gentle
and filled with joy.

1264
00:58:19,371 --> 00:58:20,831
It was, like, beautiful, right?

1265
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,041
And then they understood
that it loved this kitten,

1266
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,627
and they started using it
as, like, a teaching tool, right?

1267
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,047
So every night they take the cat back,
all right, and the next day they come in.

1268
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,883
If the gorilla learned its phrases,
it got to play with the kitten.

1269
00:58:31,967 --> 00:58:33,385
They use it as a motivational tool.

1270
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:35,971
So the gorilla's vocabulary
started going through the roof.

1271
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:39,224
All right? So, to cut to the chase,
one night they take the cat home.

1272
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,059
Somehow, the little kitten gets out.

1273
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:42,978
It got hit by car and it died.

1274
00:58:44,396 --> 00:58:46,231
Yeah, that cat you never met died.

1275
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:51,486
I'm sorry for your loss.

1276
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:56,158
I know you knew it, all of it,
for fucking 20 seconds.

1277
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,367
You know?

1278
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,202
I don't know if it was dead instantly,

1279
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,788
like if it drove right over its head
and that was it.

1280
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:05,500
Or maybe it just hit the back legs
and it tried to crawl away,

1281
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,836
but it was...
it was, like, stuck to the road,

1282
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,963
and it was... it was meowing out

1283
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,548
and it could see its breath.

1284
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:15,093
And right before it lost consciousness,
the rats came in,

1285
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:17,554
and it was...
it was just screaming, and in such...

1286
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,391
Cute little paws, it was like
little socks, trying to get up.

1287
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:22,768
I don't know what happened.

1288
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:25,020
But you seemed so fucking concerned

1289
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,648
about this kitten... I figured
I'd throw out a couple of theories.

1290
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,359
More concerned about the kitten
than the Hitler shit, by the way.

1291
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:32,569
More of a reaction.

1292
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:36,239
More of a reaction. That's fine.

1293
00:59:36,865 --> 00:59:38,658
Every crowd's a little bit different.

1294
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:41,578
That's not the point of the story.

1295
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,455
Okay? The point of the story...

1296
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,666
was now this lady had to go down
to the zoo,

1297
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,795
she had to tell the gorilla
that the kitten was dead, right?

1298
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,464
So she comes back down to the zoo,
and the gorilla's all amped up.

1299
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,299
This is its favorite part of the day.

1300
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:56,551
Its mind is engaged
and it sees its little friend.

1301
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:59,179
And at this point,
its vocabulary is, like, crazy now.

1302
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,306
The lady shows up.
The gorilla's all amped up.

1303
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,683
It looks at her like, "Oh, shit!

1304
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:06,436
What's up? Yeah!"

1305
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:07,521
Right?

1306
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,650
Now, I can't do sign language,

1307
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,027
so you have to bear with me
through the rest of this bit.

1308
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,113
I'm gonna do the best I can, all right?

1309
01:00:17,114 --> 01:00:19,574
So the thing's like, "What's up? Yeah!"

1310
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,368
All right?

1311
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:22,702
But the zookeeper lady,

1312
01:00:22,786 --> 01:00:25,747
she has, like, you know,
just sitting there all sad,

1313
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:27,958
you know, trying to think
how she's gonna tell it,

1314
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,876
and the gorilla picked up on the vibe.

1315
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,086
She's kind of like...

1316
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,921
"Hello."

1317
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,757
All of a sudden,
the gorilla's energy comes down.

1318
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:37,217
She starts looking at the lady, like...

1319
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:39,511
"What's uh...

1320
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,556
What's wrong with you?"

1321
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,520
"Is there something that I need to know?

1322
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,231
Huh?"

1323
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,279
So the lady's sitting there, she's like,

1324
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,405
"Uh...

1325
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,740
Oh, Jesus. Uh..."

1326
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,577
"Well...

1327
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,039
Well, the...

1328
01:01:08,123 --> 01:01:09,666
the kitty cat...

1329
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,502
it got hit by a car...

1330
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,796
and it's fucking dead."

1331
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,346
And the gorilla immediately took it in.

1332
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,432
It immediately took it in. It understood.

1333
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,309
Like, its bottom lip started quivering,

1334
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,103
its eyes started watering up,
it was signing "crying."

1335
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:31,855
And later on that night,

1336
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,399
you could hear it crying
inside of its house.

1337
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,276
They built it a house. I don't know why.

1338
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:37,527
They live in trees.

1339
01:01:37,611 --> 01:01:40,572
It was probably the guilt of putting
the thing in fucking jail, right?

1340
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:44,367
Whatever. It was a two-bedroom.
It sounded like it was in the kitchen.

1341
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:45,994
And you just hear this thing...

1342
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:48,622
in this house at night, just going...

1343
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,467
And that was the end of the video.

1344
01:02:08,183 --> 01:02:09,559
That was the end of the video.

1345
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,020
And, like you, I was sitting there, like,

1346
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:13,313
"What the fuck?"

1347
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,191
"You're gonna end on that?"

1348
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:19,486
And then, literally, right in that moment,
I felt my wife's head

1349
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,821
just rest on my shoulder,
and she was like,

1350
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,823
"That was so sad.

1351
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:28,203
I mean, it was beautiful,
but it was sad."

1352
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,913
And I was just like, "Get off me."

1353
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:34,000
"Just... Just get off me."

1354
01:02:34,084 --> 01:02:35,627
And I closed the laptop,

1355
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,128
set it down on the nightstand,

1356
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,339
and I just got up, and I started pacing.

1357
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:43,343
As this fucking rage was coming up in me,

1358
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,678
my wife's, like, freaking out.

1359
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,138
She's like, "What's wrong?
What is wrong with you?"

1360
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:50,100
I'm like, "What do you mean,
'What's wrong?' That video is fucked up!"

1361
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,062
What is the purpose of that?

1362
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,606
You teach a gorilla how to talk,
you're shootin' the shit,

1363
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,234
you get it a pet kitten and then it dies.

1364
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:02,904
And then the gorilla cries,
and it's fucking sad, and then that's it?

1365
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,741
That's what you're leaving me with?
I've got to have that in my fucking head?

1366
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,453
How is that the end of the video?

1367
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,414
Somebody, for fuck's sake, tell me.

1368
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:15,000
Dude, that gorilla understood
the concept of death.

1369
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:19,337
If it understands the concept of death,
it understands its own captivity. Okay?

1370
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:20,964
So it never dawned on that lady,

1371
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,174
that whole time
she's shootin' the shit with him,

1372
01:03:23,258 --> 01:03:26,094
it never dawned on her
to sign to the thing, like, "Hey."

1373
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:29,889
Like, "Do you want to get
the fuck out of here?"

1374
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,685
"Do you hate it in here?

1375
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,478
Do you want to fucking kill us...

1376
01:03:36,438 --> 01:03:38,106
for sticking you in here,

1377
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:40,859
away from your friends in the jungle?"

1378
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,652
And the thing would be like, "Yeah!"

1379
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:47,365
"Yeah, please get me out. I beg of you!

1380
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:49,784
It fucking sucks in here!"

1381
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,956
Right? And then you
could have brainstormed, right?

1382
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,709
Like,
"Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here."

1383
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,253
The only bad part would be
you'd have to deal with the gorilla

1384
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,422
and its crazy fucking gorilla idea.

1385
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,883
You know,
like brainstorming its escape plan.

1386
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,510
The gorilla would be like,
"Okay, we'll get a bunch of bananas.

1387
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:09,304
We'll throw 'em and distract 'em,

1388
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,556
and then we'll climb out
just using our arms."

1389
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:14,851
You literally just have to sit there,
going, like, "Okay. Okay.

1390
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:16,144
Uh...

1391
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:20,398
Not... Not trying to be a dick, but...

1392
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:24,694
I have a better idea.

1393
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:28,615
No, no, no. No disrespect to you. Okay?"

1394
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:34,329
"But I'm gonna go to Big & Tall.

1395
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,873
I'm gonna get a jacket, a hat,

1396
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,750
and some fucked-up-looking shoes.

1397
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,419
Okay? And what I need from you...

1398
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,838
What I need from you, okay...

1399
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:46,174
What I need from you
is you've got to lay off this shit.

1400
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,510
All right? No more of this.

1401
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,679
Okay? No, no disrespect. Okay?

1402
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:55,934
I need you...
I need you to man up, all right?

1403
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,185
Stand up straight.

1404
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,479
Arm down. Stand up straight.

1405
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,648
Here's the difficult part,
right here, okay?

1406
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,983
Left hand, right foot;

1407
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:05,944
right hand, left foot.

1408
01:05:06,027 --> 01:05:07,028
You got it?

1409
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,822
Bam. Bam.

1410
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,032
All right?

1411
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,867
You get that shit down,

1412
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,286
I'll get you out of here in ten days.

1413
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,163
Cool?

1414
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,582
It's gonna be okay. Deal.

1415
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:20,875
Fuck! All right."

1416
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:23,795
"See you in ten days, right?"

1417
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:28,049
So, like, the first day,
the gorilla's sitting there, going, "Okay.

1418
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,717
Okay."

1419
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:51,489
"No. No, no, no. No. No."

1420
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:08,715
"Okay. Okay."

1421
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,056
"Yes!"

1422
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:26,733
"Fuck!"

1423
01:06:31,404 --> 01:06:32,822
So that's the first day.

1424
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:36,117
That's day one, but the gorilla
keeps working at it, right?

1425
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,161
Like, day two -
day two it's kind of getting...

1426
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,704
Day three, day five,

1427
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,206
day seven, day nine, day ten.

1428
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:43,833
"I'm doing it! I'm fucking doing it!"

1429
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,795
Then she could have came back
and broke that gorilla out of jail, right?

1430
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:51,341
Show up at night. "You're doing it!"
Put on the jacket, hat. "Come on!"

1431
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:53,843
You take him down to the car,
the only way to get him back.

1432
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:56,221
You've got to take it by car
down to the harbor.

1433
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:59,891
That's the only way to get it back to
the jungle. You can't go to the airport.

1434
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:04,020
You can't go to the airport,
going through that fucking security.

1435
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,522
Right?

1436
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:10,026
Once he takes his shoes off
and that thumb comes sticking out,

1437
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,611
it's fucking over!

1438
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:12,862
It's over.

1439
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:14,906
You keep it below deck.

1440
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,492
You keep the fucking thing below deck

1441
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,536
until you get out to international waters.

1442
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:20,745
Then you're fine.

1443
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,080
It's captain's law.

1444
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,832
"Come aboard," right?
And have the thing sit down.

1445
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,919
Other boats going by are looking at you,
like, "Is that a gorilla?"

1446
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,047
"Yeah. What have you got, blood diamonds?
Go fuck yourself!"

1447
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:34,592
"Fucking sex slaves? Get out of here!

1448
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:38,429
I'll have him come aboard
and rip that mask right off!"

1449
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,182
And you're just hanging with the gorilla.

1450
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:44,352
You get to have that experience of seeing
the thing free for the first time.

1451
01:07:44,435 --> 01:07:46,854
As it comes over the horizon,
it finally sees the jungle.

1452
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:50,149
It's getting all excited. It jumps
off the boat, it's rolling in the sand.

1453
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,903
"Buddy, we did it! Don't fuck up the coat,
I've got to bring it back. We did it!

1454
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:57,156
All right, I love you. I'll miss you.
Get out of here before they see you."

1455
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,492
The thing runs
right to the edge of the jungle

1456
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,494
and it just... disappears.

1457
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:03,496
"It did it.

1458
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,374
I knew it.
He wanted to go see his friends, man.

1459
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,751
He wanted to be free.
It's gonna be fucking great.

1460
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:11,588
He's gonna go meet his buddies,
he's gonna talk to his friends now,

1461
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,047
like he should be, right?

1462
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:15,967
He's, uh...

1463
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:18,720
He's gonna go talk to his friends."

1464
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:25,768
"He'll... probably teach them
how to talk."

1465
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,274
"Then, of course...

1466
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,319
they'll probably get horses.

1467
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,905
Did I just start
<i>Planet of the </i>fucking <i>Apes</i>?

1468
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,742
He's gonna teach his friends
how to talk and get horses?

1469
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,619
Dude, I gotta kill this fucking thing!

1470
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,830
I gotta kill it. I fucked up.
I gotta kill it. Sorry.

1471
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:48,374
Where's my Glock?
Where the fuck is my Glock?! Where is it?

1472
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,668
It was right here!
It was right here! Fuck!"

1473
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:52,879
Got a little six shooter.
"Fuck it, I'll take this."

1474
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:55,882
You run into the jungle,
but it's a gorilla, so it's long gone.

1475
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,843
But you can't give up, man.
All of society's gonna go down on you.

1476
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,219
You've got to kill this thing.

1477
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:02,805
So you're just trudging through the jungle
for months.

1478
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,432
You get six, seven months in,

1479
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:06,184
you've got, like, malaria,

1480
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,935
you're about ready to give up.

1481
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,690
And out of nowhere,
your buddy just jumps down, just like...

1482
01:09:13,274 --> 01:09:14,609
"Oh, shit!

1483
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,986
What the fuck are you doing here?"

1484
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,741
Then you just pull out your six shooter.

1485
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:25,536
"I'm sorry, buddy.

1486
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,830
I gotta do it."

1487
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:29,832
The gorilla would be like,

1488
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:30,917
"But...

1489
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:34,796
I... I thought we were friends.

1490
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:37,799
Why?"

1491
01:09:39,717 --> 01:09:40,885
"Well, you know, 'cause...

1492
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:43,554
'cause Jesus wanted it that way,
you know?"

1493
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:48,101
"There's this whole book.
He made us in his image.

1494
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:51,229
We're just, you know...
We're better than you, you know?

1495
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,898
Sorry, I can't have you talking
to other chimps

1496
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:56,192
and then you tear down
the Statue of Liberty."

1497
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,320
"Everyone's gonna think I'm an asshole.

1498
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:02,907
Look, I'll make it quick."

1499
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:04,617
And right as you go to pull the trigger,

1500
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,828
the gorilla pulls out
that Glock you couldn't find.

1501
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,014
"I just...

1502
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:28,558
I just want to know one thing.

1503
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:31,936
How did you know?"

1504
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,566
"You knew before I knew."

1505
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,029
I don't have an ending for this.

1506
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:46,951
I don't.

1507
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,954
And in a weird way,

1508
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,414
now you know how I felt..

1509
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:53,750
when I watched that video.

1510
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,296
You know what it was?
You know what it was?

1511
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,174
I did that joke all around the country,

1512
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:03,551
all right, and the gorilla always died,

1513
01:11:03,634 --> 01:11:05,094
'cause Jesus wanted it that way...

1514
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,138
and that was it.

1515
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:09,223
And it fucking bombed

1516
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:12,143
in every goddamn city in this country

1517
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,270
except for Dallas, Texas.

1518
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,939
That was the only place where they got it.

1519
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,524
And I'm not shitting on Texas.

1520
01:11:18,608 --> 01:11:20,151
It bombed in Houston, Austin,

1521
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:21,944
El Paso, San Antonio.

1522
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,781
Killed in Dallas.
They are the only ones who got it.

1523
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:27,158
They were like,
"Hey, man, you did what you had to do.

1524
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:30,077
You did what you had to do, man."

1525
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,747
"I mean, I loved that gorilla, too,
but goddamnit,

1526
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,958
you cannot have two species
working together.

1527
01:11:37,919 --> 01:11:41,464
I tell you right now, you get a couple
of gorillas on a bareback horse

1528
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:45,051
with a single bolt action rifle,
that is the end of society as we know it."

1529
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,679
"You should get a hypothetical medal...

1530
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,599
for killing that gorilla, hypothetically."

1531
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,144
So... All right.

1532
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,481
I'm gonna end
with a quick little story here, okay?

1533
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:01,359
They're always talking about how
to make a woman happy,

1534
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:04,445
but they don't do it enough to help you
guys out how to make a man happy.

1535
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,989
The great thing about men
is we're fucking simple.

1536
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,407
We're fucking simple, okay?

1537
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,535
So here's the thing.
You want to make a guy happy?

1538
01:12:10,618 --> 01:12:13,538
If you're with a good guy, okay,
this is all you've got to do, okay?

1539
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,374
How about four times a year,
once a season...

1540
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:21,003
you go out to the kitchen.

1541
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:24,549
Without him saying shit,
you make a sandwich, you get him a beer,

1542
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:27,093
you walk out, you give it to him,
you don't say a word,

1543
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,511
and you just fucking leave.

1544
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,683
That's all you've got to do.

1545
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:37,603
Every three months, you do that,
you'll keep him happy.

1546
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:38,688
That's all it takes.

1547
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:41,023
I know right out of the gate
this is coming off sexist,

1548
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:44,318
because I'm saying, "Go out
in the kitchen. Make your man a sandwich."

1549
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:46,863
I'm not saying
women belong in the kitchen,

1550
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,240
barefoot and pregnant, rubbing my balls.

1551
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,408
I'm not saying that.

1552
01:12:52,326 --> 01:12:53,327
Okay?

1553
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:56,789
I'm just saying, women, go in the kitchen.

1554
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:00,877
Just go in the kitchen
four times in a year, make a sandwich.

1555
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,211
A toddler could do that.

1556
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:03,921
Just put it together.

1557
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,466
Grab two slices of pre-made,
pre-sliced bread,

1558
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:09,385
two handfuls of pre-murdered meat.

1559
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:11,470
Put a little mustard on it.

1560
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,930
Grab a beer, walk out,

1561
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:15,808
just hand it to him, don't say shit,
and then fucking leave.

1562
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:17,101
When I say leave, I mean leave.

1563
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,979
I don't mean walk into another room
for, like, ten minutes

1564
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,689
and then stick your head back and be like,

1565
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:23,316
"Did you like it? Was it good?

1566
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:25,860
Great, because downstairs we need to...

1567
01:13:25,943 --> 01:13:29,196
Don't yell at me!
I just made you a sandwich!"

1568
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:31,365
I don't mean that. I mean leave.

1569
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:33,910
Get in the car
and fucking get out of here.

1570
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,954
Take the kids, drive down the street.

1571
01:13:37,038 --> 01:13:39,165
Go see <i>Lord Of The Rings</i>
a couple of times,

1572
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:43,252
and leave your man in the stunned silence
of what you just did.

1573
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,380
If you ever want to see your guy
get emotional,

1574
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:50,927
to see a man get emotional, you make him
a fucking sandwich that he didn't ask for.

1575
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:54,180
I'm telling you, he's gonna have to dry
the tears with the bread.

1576
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:56,974
He's gonna be so shocked, like...

1577
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:58,851
"You made this for me?

1578
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,479
And I didn't even ask.

1579
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,481
Oh, my God!

1580
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:08,569
I think she still gives a fuck!"

1581
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,614
Yeah.

1582
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:14,825
Quick story. Me and my wife
bought a house in 2011.

1583
01:14:14,909 --> 01:14:17,244
And by "me and my wife"
I mean I paid for it.

1584
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:18,788
Right?

1585
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:21,832
She hates that joke,

1586
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:23,084
but I don't give a shit.

1587
01:14:23,918 --> 01:14:26,337
It's true.
And she's always breaking my balls.

1588
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,298
"Don't put your shoes over here.
They belong over there."

1589
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:32,176
"Yeah? Well, I bought over there,
and I bought over here,

1590
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,387
so I'll put my fucking shoes

1591
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:35,596
wherever I want to.

1592
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:38,933
Oh, shirt's coming off!

1593
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:40,226
Where's it going?"

1594
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,144
Right?

1595
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:45,815
So we get into the house.

1596
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,733
She's scoping it out,
because she's smart.

1597
01:14:47,817 --> 01:14:50,361
She's finding the rooms that get sun,
checking closet space.

1598
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,571
Me, like an idiot,
I want to check out the garage.

1599
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,281
For whatever reason, I'm drawn to this.

1600
01:14:54,365 --> 01:14:57,576
And I go down, I open the door,
and the last people hadn't cleaned it out.

1601
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:00,329
There was a busted refrigerator,
an old file cabinet,

1602
01:15:00,413 --> 01:15:02,456
an ab-roller, something from a luau.

1603
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:05,584
There were like seven failed businesses
in this goddamn thing,

1604
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:09,130
and I gotta start lugging this shit out
in, like, 90-degree weather,

1605
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:12,383
as a redhead, hating my life, right?

1606
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:15,094
I got three hours into this job,
my forearms were cut,

1607
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,054
I had dirt, sweat, cobwebs all over me.

1608
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,432
I wanted to burn down this fucking house.

1609
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:20,599
I was ready to leave.

1610
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:22,518
But out of nowhere, my wife showed up,

1611
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:25,229
big smile on her face,
and she had made me a sandwich.

1612
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:27,732
Cut it in half diagonally,

1613
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,525
which is love, right?

1614
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:32,695
If they don't cut it in half,
they might as well frisbee it.

1615
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,655
"Here you go, you fucking piece of shit.

1616
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:37,158
Hose yourself off!

1617
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:38,743
You should live out here!

1618
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:40,911
You should live out here!" Right?

1619
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,913
Cut it in half diagonally,

1620
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:44,623
poured Fritos in the middle,

1621
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,542
and gave me an ice-cold beer.

1622
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,502
She did that five years ago.

1623
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:53,007
Do you know, to this day, every once in a
while, I still think about that sandwich.

1624
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,884
It's unbelievable.

1625
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:58,471
It just pops in my head
like this fond memory.

1626
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,431
I'll just be by myself,
talking in the car.

1627
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:04,018
"Remember that time she made me
a sandwich? It was unbelievable!

1628
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,689
She cut it in half, Fritos,
an ice-cold beer. I felt like a king!"

1629
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,651
That's all it takes.
You know what it felt like at that moment?

1630
01:16:12,735 --> 01:16:15,237
You remember that movie
<i>Shawshank Redemption</i>?

1631
01:16:15,988 --> 01:16:19,575
You know that scene where the prisoners
are drinking the beer on the rooftop

1632
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:20,951
with the sun in their face?

1633
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,286
That's what it felt like.

1634
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:24,830
The only thing missing

1635
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:28,167
was Morgan Freeman's voice
narrating over the top,

1636
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,378
"And for 20 minutes,
Bill Burr felt like a free man."

1637
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:34,632
All right, I'm out of time.
You guys were so awesome.

1638
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,300
Thank you so, so much for coming out.

1639
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,887
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1640
01:16:43,057 --> 01:16:45,309
I really had a great time.
Thank you so much.
