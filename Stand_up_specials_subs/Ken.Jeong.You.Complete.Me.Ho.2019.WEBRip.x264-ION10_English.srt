00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,265
Judd Apatow said to me, he goes,

180
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,475
"You are my discovery.
You did such a great job.

181
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,228
I'm going to put you in all of my movies."
And he did.

182
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,855
So, I would not be here...

183
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,316
if it wasn't for Judd.

184
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,735
[crowd cheers]

185
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,698
And then the next day
I had to work at Kaiser,

186
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,782
you know what I mean?

187
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,165
I mean, that's how I came up with 
the Chow jizz-toss...

188
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,207
"Kaiser."

189
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,544
Toodle-oo, hopes and dreams.

190
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,503
You know?

191
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,799
Like, can you imagine having a moment
like that?

192
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:36,135
Doing a John Apatow film
and going back to your day job

193
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,511
thinking that you're stuck.

194
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,139
The next day,
I could not stop thinking about that.

195
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,224
I was like,
"Well, maybe right now I'm playing it safe

196
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,144
but maybe it's time for this college kid
to turn pro, you know what I mean?

197
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,438
Maybe I got to fucking...
I got to rethink my life!

198
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,691
Maybe this is the time for me
to pursue acting, full-time.

199
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:51,859
But, you know, look at me.

200
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,654
I know I look like a fucking
double-chinned Asian Mr. Burns

201
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,864
with bad posture, but I don't know.

202
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,407
I mean, maybe this is the time for me.

203
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,408
Maybe this is a sign."

204
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,329
By the way, I'm thinking all this
while 50 patients are waiting for me.

205
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,164
Not a good look.

206
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,333
[crowd laughs]

207
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,005
And my nurse is desperately trying
to get me to focus.

208
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,050
She goes, "Dr. Jeong, you have a patient
in Room 2 waiting for you."

209
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,220
And I'm like, "Well, nurse, you have
a doctor who doesn't give a fuck."

210
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,389
[crowd laughs]

211
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,432
"I just did a movie, Carol!

212
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,811
I just did a movie, man.
You don't get it."

213
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,234
And, believe it or not,
I quit my day job the next day.

214
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,276
True story.

215
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,070
[crowd claps]

216
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,988
I was scared, man.

217
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,658
I was fucking scared.

218
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,493
Because I didn't have any family support.

219
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:46,163
Like, my strict traditional Korean dad
who wanted me to be a doctor

220
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,540
before I was born...

221
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,710
No, he was severely
bumping on this shit, dude.

222
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,129
He was just cursing me out in Korean.

223
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:58,634
[mutters]
"You bring great shame to Jeong family!"

224
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,930
And then after The Hangover...
"We are so proud!

225
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,849
I knew you'd make it, boy!

226
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,643
I knew you'd make it! I believe in you."

227
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,854
[crowd cheers]

228
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,443
"We are so proud of your tiny ding-dong.
So proud.

229
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,197
The smaller the penis,
the bigger the box office!"

230
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,283
[Ken evilly laughs]

231
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,077
Thanks, Papa. Great praise, okay.

232
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,497
And, yes, for those of you wondering,
in The Hangover,

233
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,750
yes, that was real in the trunk.

234
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,502
I'm a grower not a show-er, all right?

235
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,756
It was cold, I swear. All right?

236
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,049
It was cold outside, all right?

237
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,636
But I'm secure about it.
It's how the pencil writes, bitch.

238
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,474
It's how it writes!
Mine can write in cursive.

239
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,767
In cursive!

240
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,477
Oh my God, calligraphy!

241
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,646
Calligraphy! Konnichiwa, bitch!

242
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,733
[crowd claps]

243
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,449
But I tell you, man,

244
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:06,869
to be Hangover rich and famous
as an Asian kid, man...

245
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,997
Asian parents,
they don't know how to govern that.

246
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,375
You know, my dad went from "father"
to "freeloader," just like that.

247
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,169
[crowd laughs]

248
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,089
I swear to God, as a kid, he was like,
"You better get me good grades!"

249
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,052
After The Hangover,
"You better get me S-Class Mercedes!

250
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,723
Because E-Class,
that's for fucking farmers."

251
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,725
Okay, Papa. Good.

252
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,896
Dude, I would not be here
if it wasn't for the fucking Hangover.

253
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,398
Mr. Chow is the best character
I've ever played.

254
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,108
He's the funniest character ever.

255
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,777
It put me on the map.

256
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,279
Dude...

257
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,656
Leslie Chow.

258
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,035
I mean, it has brought me so much joy.

259
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:51,038
The Hangover is
the best thing ever to happen

260
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,415
not only to my career,
but my fucking life.

261
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,419
That's why I don't mind getting
recognized for Mr. Chow wherever I go.

262
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,631
Literally, if anyone asks for a photo
or a selfie, I'm always nice about it.

263
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,843
If you look on Twitter,
I'm always nice doing Mr. Chow stuff

264
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,135
because I'm dead inside.

265
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,053
Now...

266
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,850
You guys wanna hear
some Hangover stories?

267
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,393
[crowd cheers in excitement]

268
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,394
All right.

269
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,689
I live in Los Angeles, the rich part,
and I'll tell you...

270
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,071
[audience member] Where?

271
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,448
I'm not going to tell you where, bitch.

272
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,537
I'm not going to tell you
I live in Calabasas.

273
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,583
Don't worry, I can say it.
It's a gated community.

274
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,834
It's fine.

275
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,128
You ain't getting in. It's fine.

276
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,547
You ain't getting in, bitch.

277
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,679
[crowd cheers]

278
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,109
Okay, I was at a Wells Fargo ATM,
withdrawing some cash.

279
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,485
A lot of cash!

280
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,406
And this middle-aged white guy,

281
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,200
this, like, motherfucking guy
with a bald head...

282
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,660
No offense, dude. I'm just like...

283
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,746
Hey, I'm sorry.

284
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,249
Oh, my God.
Dennis, get a load of this guy.

285
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,587
Oh, my God, 
that's fucking Locke from Lost over there.

286
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,757
Oh, my God,
he's got the secret to the hatch!

287
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,301
Look at that guy! Fucking Lost.

288
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,594
Oh, my God.

289
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,348
He's like an ugly Locke from Lost.

290
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,936
And I'm an ugly Daniel Dae Kim,
so it all works out fine.

291
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,522
Daniel Dae "Chins," maybe.

292
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,027
And this fucking white "Ho"-looking
motherfucker

293
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:49,698
is looking at me from a sedan 
with the window half-cracked open.

294
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,035
True story. He's staring at me,
and I'm withdrawing some cash.

295
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,622
Staring at me, withdrawing some cash.
Staring at me, withdrawing some cash.

296
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,250
The light turns green so he can go,
"Toodle-oo, motherfucker!"

297
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,379
Every fucking day, you know what I mean?

298
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,591
I was on a plane promoting Hangover II.
First class.

299
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,801
And, uh...

300
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,181
True story.
There's a person in the back of the plane

301
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,558
and there were concerns
he may have had a stroke.

302
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,435
He had some vertigo,
he had some dizziness,

303
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,479
some weakness,
a little bit of slurred speech,

304
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,773
and the flight attendant
was understandably panicked.

305
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,401
"Is there a doctor on the plane?
Is there a doctor on the plane?"

306
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,987
So, you know, I raise my hand
and I was like, "Well, I, um...

307
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,989
Well, it's complicated but..."

308
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,449
[crowd laughs]

309
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,831
"But I used to be a doctor."

310
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,085
She was like, "Sit down, Chow. Jesus."

311
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,504
"Catch that, Phyllis?"

312
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,965
Everyone's laughing at me on the plane.

313
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,592
Dude, even the strokie
in the back of the plane...

314
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,013
Making a bubble
with his drool or something.

315
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,307
But I was promoting Hangover II,

316
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,351
which, actually, I think is
my favorite Hangover movie,

317
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:04,398
because the cinematography was
absolutely amazing in Bangkok, Thailand.

318
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,524
Anyone from Thailand?

319
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,775
Oh, really?

320
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,152
-Yeah.
-You're a Thai!

321
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,279
-That's awesome. Where are you from?
-Bangkok.

322
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,780
Bangkok!

323
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,241
You look so cute! Look!

324
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,618
Natey, get a shot of him, man!

325
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,203
Look at that!

326
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,415
You know what I call this?
You know what I call this?

327
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,834
Son of Chow. He looks amazing.

328
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,127
[crowd laughs]

329
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,630
Own that shit, boy.

330
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,051
-What's your name, man?
-Mike.

331
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,677
Mike. What's your last name?

332
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,928
Bayakorbachik.

333
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,890
[crowd laughs]

334
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,312
You're not Thai.

335
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,981
You're Jewish.

336
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,067
[crowd laughs]

337
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,570
I mean, what do you think, Tran?
Do you think that's legit?

338
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,531
I don't know. You're kind of my wife, now.
I don't know.

339
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:02,790
Why do I feel like the Asians are
getting back at me for some reason?

340
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:11,006
Not to get off on a fucking tangent, dude.
This is not even related.

341
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,593
But you know what? I got so much shit
from the Asian community

342
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,719
for the first Hangover.

343
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,597
That was controversial at that time,
like, 10 years ago.

344
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,517
Because, seriously,
I had fucking Asian haters, dude.

345
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,645
Asian haters on the internet,
they're the fucking worst, dude.

346
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,480
White trolls are bad.

347
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,899
But Asian trolls,
they're the stickiest, dude.

348
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,150
No, no. For real.

349
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,820
This is a real comment.
I'm not making this up.

350
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:37,282
This is a real comment
from someone on Reddit,

351
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
and is still up there, all right?

352
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,410
You can look it up.

353
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,039
"Ken, if I ever see you in public,

354
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,084
I will choke you within a few seconds
from death

355
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,961
with my bare hands.

356
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:52,965
Fuck you, you piece of shit
do-anything-for-a-dollar whore."

357
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,467
And that was my mom, all right?

358
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,803
[crowd laughs]

359
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,148
I tell you,
these fucking Asian haters, man.

360
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,858
They hate themselves, dude.

361
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,443
They fucking hated the fact
I had a thick accent

362
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,112
and I had a small penis, dude.

363
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,780
I was born with that shit!

364
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,825
That's not a stereotype!
That's fucking real to me!

365
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,160
How are they mad?

366
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,745
And they want me to apologize for that?

367
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,582
What do I say? "Me so sorry?"
I don't know what to say!

368
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,208
My God!

369
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,544
Dude, I get so much shit for The Hangover!

370
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:33,338
I did a lot of social justice
in The Hangover!

371
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,966
I was a social justice warrior
in that shit.

372
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,301
Think about that.

373
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:41,054
I jumped out of a trunk and beat up
the white man three times, all right?

374
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,473
[crowd cheers]

375
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,687
I should be the fucking Malcolm X
of my community.

376
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,982
Not yellow Urkel, all right?

377
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,361
There are Asian teenage boys
that actually blame me.

378
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,572
They think they can't get laid
by white women

379
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,159
because somehow my small dick
has scared the white chick away.

380
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,077
People say that about me!

381
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,372
Dude, stop rejecting this papa shit.

382
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,584
Maybe you're too bold like your father,
never satisfied like your mother,

383
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,420
and that, bitch, is when doves cry, okay?

384
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,763
I loved shooting in Bangkok.
We were there for two months.

385
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,349
I went with my wife and we were there...
Remember that, sweetie?

386
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,808
I remember that.

387
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,144
Good times, right?

388
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,271
[crowd laughs]

389
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:33,774
And, in the photo credits at the end,

390
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,275
when you're looking at
the forgotten night,

391
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,737
there's a stripper, a nude stripper
that has a ping pong ball.

392
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,030
I don't know if you remember that scene.

393
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,783
She has a ping pong ball,
and she's putting that up her hootch,

394
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,411
and it's coming out like she's
the Serena Williams of pussy pong.

395
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,999
It was a sight to behold.
Like, boom, boom, boom.

396
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,251
And I'm not even kidding,

397
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,878
on the first take,
it hit Bradley Cooper in the mouth.

398
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:55,837
I'm not even kidding.

399
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,006
[crowd cheers]

400
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,302
That is gospel.

401
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,307
And then, stupid me,
I'm going, "Syphilis, hot boy!"

402
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,561
'Cause that's what I do.
You know what I mean?

403
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,397
That's what I do, you know?

404
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,774
But my whole point is,
a lot of people are asking

405
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,860
like, you know, "Do you have to 
do medicine on a movie set

406
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,570
or in a comedy club or anything?"

407
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,906
All the fucking time. I always have...

408
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,909
Dude, so many times I go into doctor mode.
It's like Godfather 3.

409
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,704
"Just when I think I'm out,
they pull me back in," you know?

410
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,539
Everywhere, you know?

411
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,708
Recently, I was at a club in Phoenix.

412
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,042
I don't know if you heard about this.

413
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,504
A lady in the third row had a seizure
in one of my stand-up shows.

414
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,382
It wasn't because of a bad joke,
I'm just saying...

415
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,926
But TMZ reported this,

416
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,429
and my publicist didn't want me
to talk about it, which I didn't.

417
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,348
But I want you to hear,
for the first time, on Netflix,

418
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,767
me talk about it in my own words,
all right?

419
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,603
I'm making fun of people 
like I normally do in my act.

420
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,939
"Hos to the left of me,
Hos to the right to me..."

421
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,525
So I'm doing my schtick,
like Asian Don Rickles,

422
00:21:58,608 --> 00:21:59,860
and there's a lady...

423
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,945
[crowd laughs]

424
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:07,409
There was a lady in the third row,
and she was, like, "Mr. Chow! Mr. Chow!"

425
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,370
I'm, like, "Calm down, bitches.
I'll get to you, it'll be fine."

426
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,290
And they were, like,
"No, someone passed out."

427
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:17,419
And a lady fell down off her chair
and she was just completely out.

428
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,088
And I dropped the mic,
and I rushed over there,

429
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,256
and went into "doctor" mode,

430
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,675
and it was the most surreal,
sublime experience ever,

431
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,261
because I'm no longer a comedian,
I'm a doctor.

432
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,598
And the whole comedy club were no longer
like a comedy club audience.

433
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,268
We're like an ER of, like,
nurses and aides trying to help her out.

434
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,895
It was so fucking amazing.

435
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,146
And I'm thinking to myself, like,

436
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,274
"Oh my God, I may have to do CPR
on this person."

437
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:43,320
And I have to assess the ABCs
before you do CPR.

438
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,489
You know,
"Airway," "Breathing," "Circulation."

439
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,824
Not "Always Be Closing."
It's a different thing.

440
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,165
And I actually... If you go on YouTube,

441
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,876
I have done work with the
American Heart Association,

442
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:02,756
teaching medical students and nurses
how to do hands-only compression CPR.

443
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,466
You don't have to do
mouth-to-mouth anymore.

444
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,301
So it's true. This is a medical fact.

445
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,345
I have two medical facts, all right?
Number one...

446
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,679
The number one medical fact,

447
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,308
look, if you're ever in the position where
unfortunately, you may have to do CPR,

448
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,978
you do chest compressions
to the beat of "Stayin' Alive," all right?

449
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,525
It's like, Ah, ah, ah, ah,
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive

450
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,819
[crowd laughs]

451
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,363
It's true.

452
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,199
[crowd claps]

453
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:35,288
And I'm thinking to myself,
"Am I gonna have to Bee Gee this bitch?"

454
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,376
And then, fortunately, I did not have to.

455
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,460
She got up quickly.

456
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,963
She had what they call
a "petit mal" seizure.

457
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,298
She's on medication and she had a history
of epilepsy.

458
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,300
By the way,
she allowed me to tell this story.

459
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,468
Her name is Christy.

460
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,512
I actually flew her out
to one of my shows in New York.

461
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:51,847
She is doing fine.

462
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,142
So everything... Happy ending alert.
Everything is good.

463
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,148
But when we sat her up,

464
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,443
we actually did a mental status exam
with an audience member

465
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,902
who happened to be a paramedic,

466
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,279
and we were asking her questions

467
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,698
because she's a little bit confused
after the seizure.

468
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,825
She was like, "What's your name?"
"Christy."

469
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,368
"Where are you?"
"Phoenix."

470
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,744
"Who are you here to see?"

471
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,663
And then she turns and looks at me,
and then she vomits.

472
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,665
So, it's a normal response.

473
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,837
And within minutes, the paramedics
take care of her and she's fine.

474
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,673
My whole point is,
if you don't like any of my shit,

475
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,384
you don't have to have a fucking seizure,
and a fucking...

476
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,220
You can just walk out, bitch.
I already got paid.

477
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,972
I already got the check.

478
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,683
And you know what?

479
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,186
That's not even
my worst seizure tale, all right?

480
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,148
Dude, I did Ride Along 2
with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart,

481
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,401
and we were shooting in a nightclub
in Atlanta.

482
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,404
Four hundred background actors
in a nightclub

483
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,532
and a person has a severe
generalized tonic-clonic seizure

484
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,451
and the whole nightclub clears out.

485
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,119
So, I'm running towards the patient

486
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,372
and Ice Cube, who is the baddest
motherfucker on the planet...

487
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,749
He's amazing!

488
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,918
He's fucking running
towards the patient, too,

489
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,462
We're like two outfielders 
going for the same ball.

490
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:08,340
And I tell you, he's taking out a belt.

491
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,301
I'm like,
"Whoa, you don't whip the patient, Cube!

492
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,219
No!"

493
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,638
I don't know him.
I'm more of a Reba McEntire fan.

494
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:18,433
And he's running out to the patient,
and he gets to him before I do.

495
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,936
He puts the belt
around the patient's mouth,

496
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,020
so he wouldn't choke on his tongue.

497
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,481
Ice Cube, not me, 
saved the patient's life.

498
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,816
-It was amazing!
-[cheering]

499
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,152
Just a shout-out to Cube.

500
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,032
And to make small talk,

501
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:37,702
I was like, "So, Ice Cube,
I guess that was a good day."

502
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,666
While Kevin Hart ran away.

503
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:45,210
"Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!
Jesus Christ! Oh, my God!

504
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,921
Snap, crackle, pop!
I gotta get the fuck out of here!"

505
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,008
"Calm down, your snappy midget!
Everything is fine."

506
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,468
Everything.

507
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,557
And by the way, it was Kevin Hart

508
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,851
who actually got me into doing
stand-up again in the first place.

509
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:04,145
No joke. Yes. Shout-out to Kevin.

510
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,064
He's one of my dear friends.

511
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,568
He's one of my favorite guys in comedy

512
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,027
because he's the only one
shorter than me.

513
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,862
[crowd laughs]

514
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,698
He literally would give me advice.

515
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,742
I mean, Kevin, literally,
every day on Ride Along 2,

516
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,411
he would just remind me,
"You got to do stand-up."

517
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,787
Because we go back 15 years.

518
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,455
And I love when Kevin Hart gives me advice

519
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,624
because he's the only guy looking up,
you know what I mean?

520
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:25,542
It's just so great.

521
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,252
And I call him "Rice Krispies"

522
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,838
because he's just always making
snap-crackle-pop noises

523
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:30,797
wherever he goes.

524
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,882
"Oh, man, Ken! Snap, crackle, pop, man!

525
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,926
You gotta go back!
Gotta go back and do stand-up, man!

526
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,012
You're leaving millions on the table, man!

527
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:39,097
Snap, crackle, pop, ping, pang, pow!

528
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,267
Ping, pang, pow! You gotta do that!

529
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,893
You gotta do stand-up,
and do it like this!

530
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,771
And then you gotta do it like this!
Then maybe you can do it like this!

531
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,857
I gotta do it, man! Ping, pang, pow!"

532
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,110
I was like, "Oh, you're so cute.
Of course I'll do it for you.

533
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,988
I will do it, you're so cute.
Come here, give me a hug."

534
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,791
A lot of people ask me, like,
"Do you still practice medicine?"

535
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,835
I'm like, you know, "Why?"

536
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,796
I mean, look at me, dude.

537
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,258
Like, yeah, sure, I want to get sued
every chance I get.

538
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,720
At Kaiser, depositions were my jam.

539
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,389
Sure, my wife's also a doctor.

540
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,267
Yeah, sure, we want to work
every other week, every major holiday.

541
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,020
We would never see each other, sure.
I want that lifestyle back.

542
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,523
Yeah, sure, I want to voluntarily
put my finger up the holes

543
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:34,319
of every patient that I see,
willy-fucking-nilly.

544
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:35,820
[crowd laughs]

545
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:39,741
Dude, I'm Hollywood, bitch.
I got out of Shawshank, all right?

546
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,077
West Side!

547
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,085
But I will say shit 
doctors are afraid to say, all right?

548
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,378
Just a couple of tips.

549
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,422
Stop Googling your shit before you see
the doctor.

550
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:57,092
It never works!

551
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,843
I had a patient come up to me,

552
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,096
and the patient was like,
"Oh, I looked it up online,

553
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,640
I have right-sided pain.
It's an ovarian cyst."

554
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,684
"You're a dude. Knock it off, all right?"

555
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,852
[crowd laughs]

556
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,155
Okay, ladies... 
Okay, get ready, all right?

557
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:22,117
Ladies, when you see your doctor 
for a pap smear,

558
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,246
and this is with all due respect,
make it presentable.

559
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,914
That's all we're saying.

560
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,500
Less Chewbacca, more Ewok, all right?

561
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,086
We don't want That '70s Show up in here.

562
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,631
You don't want to have what we call 
a General Ackbar situation

563
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,550
from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.

564
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,387
You know that fish-mouthed alien?
That was named after a dank vajayjay.

565
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,346
It was.

566
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,849
Because when you put your speculum in,
it goes, "It's a trap!"

567
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,766
You don't want that.

568
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,935
[crowd laughs]

569
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,318
So, to answer your question...
No, I don't do medicine anymore.

570
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,487
[crowd laughs]

571
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,535
No, man, I've gotten to meet everybody
from The Hangover.

572
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,539
I mean, literally, I just got to meet
everybody I've ever wanted to meet.

573
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,041
I got to meet my favorite actor
in the world, Tom Hanks,

574
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,293
at the Golden Globes.

575
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:15,587
That was amazing.
He's my favorite actor in the world.

576
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,549
By the way, did you think that
my voice as Mr. Chow was my real accent?

577
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:20,925
Okay.

578
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,304
Tom Hanks... I met him, I said hello.

579
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,306
And Tom was, like,
"Really? You don't talk like that?"

580
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,308
I'm like.
"Really, fucking Forrest Gump? Really?

581
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,518
Are you fucking kidding me?

582
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:34,272
[crowd cheers]

583
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:42,155
Do you walk around carrying 
a box of fucking chocolates

584
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,993
while talking to a Wilson volleyball,
you Cast Away motherfucker?

585
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,001
I got to meet presidents
because of The Hangover.

586
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,462
I met Bill Clinton while we were
doing Hangover II.

587
00:29:57,545 --> 00:30:00,590
We were in Bangkok.
Clinton was also in Bangkok,

588
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,425
doing God-knows-what.

589
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,054
That's Slick Willie for you,
you know what I mean?

590
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,765
If Obama
is a high school principal,

591
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,267
Bill Clinton is a PE coach
slipping you some ganja,

592
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,061
going, "Don't tell anyone, okay?"

593
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,146
[crowd laughs]

594
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:21,486
But he has the highest IQ of any
modern-day US president.

595
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,987
He's a political genius.

596
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:27,534
There is no one more politically smart
than Bill Clinton.

597
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,120
He is so convincing, he is so charismatic,
he is so engaging.

598
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,205
I went to a fundraiser...

599
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:34,833
He was so persuasive,
I would suck his dick.

600
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:35,750
I really would.

601
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,838
Just give me a blue dress.
I fucking dare you.

602
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:46,636
[Ken hums the National Anthem]

603
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,100
I'm sucking his dick for freedom, guys.

604
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,478
And jiggling his balls
for the environment.

605
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,026
I got to meet Obama, which was amazing.

606
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,027
Yes!

607
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,154
Obama.

608
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,908
Not Barack. His half-brother Fred
who runs a Macy's in Queens.

609
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,826
Now...

610
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,245
No, I got to meet Obama 
with Zach Galifianakis

611
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,372
who played Alan in The Hangover,
who by the way...

612
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,749
Zach Galifianakis is the
funniest motherfucker alive.

613
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,918
He's my favorite actor 
I've ever worked with because...

614
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,046
Like Kevin Hart, we all go way back
doing stand-up comedy.

615
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,549
And when he was doing it,
I always hated following him

616
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,593
because he was always
the funniest guy in the room.

617
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,219
But here we are at the White House,

618
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,930
meeting the sitting president
of the United States

619
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,390
and I have to follow him again.

620
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,100
I'm like, "Fuck, dude!"

621
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,436
Because Zach comes with jokes, man.

622
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,854
He comes loaded with jokes,

623
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,106
and this is the first time
Obama and Zach had met

624
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:42,066
before they did
the Between Two Ferns thing.

625
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,234
So they were instantly...

626
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,403
Dude, they were on. They were simpatico.

627
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,990
I was watching their fucking comedy
kinship from the beginning.

628
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,700
Zach whips out a two-dollar bill,
and goes,

629
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,493
"Do you have change for this,
for this photo session?"

630
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,623
and Obama is laughing so hard, going,
"Very droll, Zach, Very droll."

631
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,877
And I'm standing to the side
in a suit and a tie

632
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,171
because I'm a good fucking Asian,
you know what I mean?

633
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,923
I'm standing with a suit and a tie

634
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,843
and I'm having what I call my
"Google Image resting face," all right?

635
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,888
Because when you Google-Image
search me, you always get this...

636
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,183
[crowd laughs]

637
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,854
[crowd claps]

638
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:27,111
And by the way, when it says
"Wear a suit and a tie,"

639
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,363
that's what you do, you know?

640
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,739
Zach is such a rock star,

641
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,284
he's wearing a T-shirt, Toughskins
and some fucking Crocs

642
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,079
and he's like POTUS's
favorite son, all of a sudden.

643
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,373
And then it's my turn. I can't follow him.

644
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,332
I don't have jokes.

645
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,210
I just want to do my photo 
and get the fuck out of there.

646
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,045
Obama's like... He looks at the card.

647
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,297
I don't know if he knows who I am.
He's looking at me.

648
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,299
I'm right there.
Secret Service is right there.

649
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,386
He goes, "Oh."
And he does his whole drawl...

650
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,972
[he drawls]

651
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,850
"Oh, it's Ken! Hmm, yeah.

652
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,310
We like Ken, don't we?"

653
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,478
I'm like, "What?"

654
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,152
So, I walk in, he puts his arm around me,
and I'm just...

655
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,070
Same face.

656
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,197
[crowd laughs]

657
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:16,369
And he's disappointed at me because,
unlike Zach, I'm not doing anything.

658
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,830
His exact words,
"Come on, man. Loosen up, man.

659
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,081
You're a little stiff, man."

660
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,792
Literally, Galifianakis comes in
and he goes,

661
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,670
"This is how 
you entertain the president, Ken."

662
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:29,424
And he and Obama proceed
to verbally roast me for five minutes.

663
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,970
It was a roast battle.
It was like fucking Jeselnik and Ross.

664
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,054
Like, fucking...

665
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,056
It was like...
They were telling me to loosen up.

666
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,101
And I'm like, "Well, I suppose
I could loosen up my tie."

667
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,980
And Obama, I swear to God,
he said the driest...

668
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,565
He said, "No, I've seen your work.

669
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,859
No nudity.
It's a family affair, a family show."

670
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,028
[crowd laughs]

671
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,613
And that's why I voted for Trump. Now...

672
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,202
Because he's a great guy.
Not racist, rarely tweets.

673
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,582
I got a Trump story, too, man.

674
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,292
I had a... I could have met him.

675
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,587
We were both booked to be on Jimmy Fallon
together, a couple of years ago,

676
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,297
when he was a presumptive
Republican nominee,

677
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,506
and I was the second guest.

678
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,133
Dude, I am scared of Trump.

679
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:14,260
Asians are fucking scared of Trump
like Godzilla.

680
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,553
We are just fucking scared.

681
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,556
Dude, when Trump got elected,
my daughter Zoey...

682
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,975
She was just like,
"Oh, my God. Do we have to bow to him?"

683
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,229
I swear to God. And I'm, like,,
"Yes. Yes, you do, Zoey."

684
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:29,025
Get your "bow" game on, bitch.
He's the president, all right?

685
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,111
But I was so scared to meet him.
I'm really frightened to meet him.

686
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,696
And they're like, fucking, "Why, dude?"

687
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,532
I'm like, "Think about it, okay?"
Stay with me for a second, all right?

688
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,284
He's a big Hangover fan,
and wanted to meet me.

689
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,287
He's seen my fucking big bush
in The Hangover, all right?

690
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,248
He's seen me naked.
He's seen my shiitake mushroom.

691
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:48,294
You know what I mean? Just stay with me.
What if he gets really horny and shit?

692
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,672
You just don't know. Horny or hangry
or whatever the fuck he gets.

693
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:54,759
When he gets aroused,
all that Access Hollywood shit came out.

694
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,095
What if he wants to grab
my almost-pussy, guys?

695
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,597
I don't want to get "Me Too-ed"'
by the president!

696
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,057
[crowd laughs]

697
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,060
And that is when Ken Jeong became woke.

698
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,728
You know, you don't want that.

699
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,356
Don't worry, that's not going to make it
in the special.

700
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,565
It'll be fine.

701
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,278
Because I don't think he's going to be
around for that long, so...

702
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,615
I swear to fucking God.

703
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,909
[crowd cheers and claps]

704
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:26,749
When Obama is speaking, he goes,
"How hard is it to condemn Nazism?

705
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,378
How hard is it after Charlottesville
to condemn racism?"

706
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,882
You know, he's appeasing to his
racist alt-right base and shit.

707
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,928
Even the racists are like,
"Dude, tone it down, Donnie!

708
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,346
Dude, we get it!"

709
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,058
Even David Duke,
"Whoa, save some racism for us!

710
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,478
We get it. This is not how you're racist."

711
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:51,983
For real, I was in Palm Springs,
all right? Two hours south of here,

712
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,276
thinking that would be safe,

713
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,989
and I got fucking heckled by
a Trump white-trash supporter, man.

714
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,741
I've never been heckled
by white trash before!

715
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,286
I was just like...
And it gave me no end of pleasure

716
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,205
to say, "As a minority millionaire..."

717
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,416
[crowd laughs]

718
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,044
[crowd cheers]

719
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,969
...you can suck on these Chinese nuts!"

720
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,223
[crowd claps]

721
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,479
"And I'm Korean."

722
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,277
All right, all right.

723
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:39,322
Gonna get all that...
We'll shake that off, shake that off.

724
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,617
I'll be back as
Mr. Chow, Mr. Chow, Mr. Chow.

725
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,954
-You guys watch Dr. Ken?
-Yeah!

726
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:49,123
[crowd claps]

727
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,793
And that's why it got canceled. Now...

728
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,633
If I'm going to be honest with you
right now...

729
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,635
This is the most honest I'll ever be,
right now...

730
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,552
It is like...

731
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,263
Seriously, our show got canceled
about a year ago,

732
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,683
and I honestly am still down about it.
I am so sad about it.

733
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,227
I created that show.

734
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,147
I was a writer on that show,
executive producer on that show.

735
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:18,069
We had five Asian-American people of color
on an ABC series.

736
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:23,241
It was my biggest accomplishment
of my career.

737
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,788
And I'll tell you,

738
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,540
as a guy who had 44 episodes of that show

739
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,336
and I put my heart and life and blood
and sweat into that show.

740
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,089
What could be worse?
I mean, this was like the worst thing

741
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,968
that ever happened to a Hollywood guy,
losing his Hollywood show.

742
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,804
How life could get--
How worse could life get than that?

743
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,224
So there I am, sobbing in my mansion,
eating some Pad Thai

744
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,976
yelling at my houseboy.

745
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:01,487
And I don't have any gigs upcoming.

746
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,739
I don't have anything.
I have nothing planned.

747
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:04,991
I was like, "Jesus Christ.

748
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:09,203
I hope I don't have to go back and do
stand-up at the Ice House or something."

749
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,081
I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.

750
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,417
You know what I mean? I would hate that.

751
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,754
But then the moment Dr. Ken got canceled,

752
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,590
I got a call from the director of
Crazy Rich Asians.

753
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,259
[crowd cheers]

754
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,020
And literally within an hour,

755
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,231
I'm on a plane to Singapore,
a 17-hour flight...

756
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,818
And, by the way... To shoot my first scene
in Crazy Rich Asians...

757
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:46,073
And, by the way, that movie is the first
all-Asian-American cast...

758
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,077
Twenty-five years in a Hollywood film...

759
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,709
...since The Joy Luck Club.

760
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,255
Think about this,
my first scene I shot that movie,

761
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,343
the first scene, 24 hours prior,
Dr. Ken had just been canceled.

762
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,471
So, to me, that's all I see when I see
that movie.

763
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,348
And that movie got me
through everything.

764
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,851
Because you know what?
Director Jon M. Chu let me improvise.

765
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,562
All that shit 
was just off the top of my head.

766
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,855
Me and...

767
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,732
Me and Aquafina...

768
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,025
Aquafina...

769
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,110
is my daughter.

770
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,195
I love her so much.

771
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,572
I'm Papa-fina to her Aquafina.

772
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,368
We both improvised that shit.

773
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,162
I mean, we were just on a fucking...
It was so therapeutic.

774
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:37,166
None of that shit was in the script.
Cal State Fullerton is my...

775
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,126
-[crowd cheers]
-You know what I mean?

776
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,008
That's my new "Toodle-oo, motherfuckers,"
you know what I mean?

777
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,891
But it was amazing that I got to
improvise that whole scene

778
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,850
and get away with it.

779
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,018
I mean, it was, like, crazy.

780
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,104
We didn't pay attention to the script

781
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,357
to the point where the director was like,
"What the fuck," you know?

782
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,276
And then you jump-cut a year later.

783
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,530
It is the number one movie,
three weeks in a row.

784
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,949
[crowd cheers]

785
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,159
Insane.

786
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:16,038
None of us expected that.

787
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,502
To have so much representation
on the screen

788
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,839
means everything to me,
because that's all I wanted Dr. Ken to be.

789
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:28,759
I wanted Dr. Ken to show
more Asian-Americans on the screen,

790
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,138
and in Crazy Rich Asians,
they did it in such grand style.

791
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:36,350
Crazy Rich Asians actually allowed me
to let go of Dr. Ken.

792
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:40,604
So, everything's so full-circle
and so therapeutic.

793
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,194
And what makes it even more full circle

794
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,864
is that the director of Crazy Rich Asians
is in the back,

795
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,074
directing my Netflix special right now.

796
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,325
[crowd cheers]

797
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,799
All right, you don't have to clap
that fucking hard, all right?

798
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,093
It's my fucking show.

799
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:17,975
All right, my whole point is,

800
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,854
the moral of the story is that
I'm a rich person who just got richer.

801
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:24,773
Now... Yay, me. Yay, me.

802
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,526
Uptown problems.

803
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:30,571
All right.

804
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,449
This is how comedians fucking get ready
for their big show.

805
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:36,410
They have a list of jokes, because
this is how a real comedian does it.

806
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,328
You know, I'm just gonna...

807
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,247
You'll see me just look at some
of my stuff, like a good fucking Asian.

808
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,332
Just kind of like a...

809
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,965
After Dr. Ken, I had a lot of free time,

810
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:54,887
so I actually went and did jury duty
in Van Nuys.

811
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,514
[crowd cheers]

812
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:02,728
And what is the point of being famous if
you can't get out of fucking jury duty?

813
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,358
True story, it was a murder trial.

814
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:11,487
The defendant recognized me.

815
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,075
[crowd laughs]

816
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,876
And he looks at me, like...

817
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,046
"Oh, shit!"

818
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,715
[crowd laughs]

819
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,473
"But did you die?"

820
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:48,232
"Your honor, sidebar, your honor, please.

821
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:51,777
Your honor, I can't serve on this jury.

822
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,614
I can't put a fan in jail.
It'll ruin my brand, all right?"

823
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,910
And she's like, "Trust me, a lot
of your fans are in the clink, so..."

824
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,291
Nailed it.

825
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,918
[crowd laughs]

826
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,556
What I loved about doing Dr. Ken

827
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,309
is that I got to actually put
my daughter on the show.

828
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,643
I actually have two kids.

829
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,897
I have two daughters.
Alexa, named after the Amazon Echo...

830
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,735
and Zoey,
named after Kravitz or Deschanel,

831
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,944
depending if you're black or white.

832
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,154
Now...

833
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,072
I got Zoey on the show.

834
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,200
She played the stalker to my TV son.

835
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,911
And her name was Emily
and she is funnier than me.

836
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,164
I actually am kind of like a...

837
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,833
I'm like a tiger mom of Asian...

838
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,544
Like, I want my daughter to be an actor,
I won't lie to you.

839
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,255
Because I think she's funnier than me
and I was really wanting her to...

840
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,257
And she was so good on the show,

841
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,719
to the point that ABC wanted to
make her a series regular.

842
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,095
It was so exciting.

843
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,306
I went up to Zoey. I said, "Oh, my God!"

844
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,266
Isn't it amazing?
Do you want to be on more Dr. Ken?"

845
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,018
She was like, "Do I have to?"

846
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,729
Like, what the fuck?

847
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:10,189
"You got a fresh-off-the-boat offer

848
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,690
I don't know about, or...?"

849
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,360
[crowd laughs]

850
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,323
"Are you leveraging me 
to get on Black-ish, bitch? I mean..."

851
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,246
No, it turned out she just wants to be
a normal kid, man.

852
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,415
She just doesn't even want to be an actor.

853
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,417
She just wants to chart her own path,

854
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:35,130
not unlike me when I told my father
I wanted to chart my own path.

855
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,342
So, far be it for me
to deny my daughter that opportunity.

856
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,843
So I wrote her out of the show

857
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,470
and it was a great exit scene,

858
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,014
and my wife and I
were just standing, watching her.

859
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,641
She did such an amazing job

860
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:49,853
and as a father, I couldn't be more proud
of my independent daughter.

861
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,607
But as a producer, if she ever decides to
get back in the game,

862
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,901
I'll fucking crush her, all right?

863
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,195
[crowd laughs]

864
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:06,078
I get a lot of stuff where people think
I'm kind of the model minority

865
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,454
and it's a lot of... I don't know.

866
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,207
I guess it's a little heavy for me
because, think about it...

867
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,460
Like, oh, you're a doctor,
you're an actor, you're a comedian,

868
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:14,753
you're an Instagram model.

869
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,380
You can do all of these things.

870
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,724
And the truth of the matter, man...

871
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,267
Like, no, when I was in med school, dude,

872
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,603
I almost failed out of med school
three times, dude.

873
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,064
I was not a smart medical student.

874
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:38,944
I actually failed my board entrance exams,
like, three times.

875
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:42,281
I mean, dude, they're all multiple choice,
eight-hour test

876
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,491
and I just couldn't do well
on those exams.

877
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,202
Those tests are fucking racially biased,
all right?

878
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,414
Against Asian students 
who don't study very hard.

879
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,331
Now...

880
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,504
And I felt like, you know...

881
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,133
I felt like a phony just walking around
the halls of the hospital in med school.

882
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,802
I felt like I got in
only because it was my birthright.

883
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:04,845
You know what I mean?

884
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,930
I mean, here's my interview
for med school.

885
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,640
So, Ken, tell me about yourself.

886
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,059
-Well, I'm Korean.
-Stop. Congratulations, you're in.

887
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,269
-That's it?
-That's it.

888
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,897
Small-dick scholarship.

889
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,232
[crowd laughs]

890
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,569
But I think that's why I worked so hard
as a physician.

891
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:24,198
I worked at Kaiser Permanente
for seven years, and I really did.

892
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,783
I was very hardcore.

893
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,618
I never joked around with my patients.

894
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,995
I took that shit very, very seriously

895
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,371
because everyone was like,
"You always joke."

896
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,457
How about, "You never joked around?"
I'm like, "No."

897
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,709
They were, "Come on, man,
laughter is the best medicine."

898
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:38,796
"No, fuck that.
Medicine is the best medicine!

899
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:39,963
All right?

900
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,716
Have you ever tried Klonopin?
It's amazing!"

901
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,884
You know?

902
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,847
And it's not like I was like fucking
Patch Adams or some shit like that,

903
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,265
like a fucking clown.

904
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,767
It's not like I went up to some people
and go,

905
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,270
"Oh, you got herpes,
but I got your nose! Honk! Honk!"

906
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,689
[crowd laughs]

907
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,820
Getting back to my wife.

908
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,364
We've been together long time, right?
A long time.

909
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:09,034
I've been pimpin' that Ho
for 16 years, and...

910
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,370
You know?

911
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:12,830
And you know what?

912
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,123
I love you so much.
The pimping was easy.

913
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,166
It was.

914
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,795
You know what I miss about Tran?

915
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,797
I miss, like... I was just thinking
about this the other day.

916
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,841
When we were engaged, you know,

917
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,759
we were motivated as a couple, you know,

918
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,178
we were just trying to impress each other
and, quite frankly,

919
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,972
we're very, very different, okay?

920
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:33,350
We're very different on the surface,
because she's, like, from San Francisco.

921
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:36,979
She's uptown, she's cosmopolitan,
well-read.

922
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,564
She's very, very cultured.

923
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:41,859
Me, I'm a redneck from North Carolina
who loves wrestling, all right?

924
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,611
So we're a little different,
even though...

925
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,156
And the thing is, to impress her...
She's a big sci-fi fan.

926
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,742
So, I read all three
Lord of the Rings books

927
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,911
just to show her I could fucking read.

928
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,497
Well, I didn't read it.

929
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,457
I read the Cliff Notes.
Well, most of the Cliff Notes.

930
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,792
Most of it.

931
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,712
And she's also very outdoorsy and, like,
you know.

932
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:05,090
So we go for a hike in Eagle Rock
and do all that shit.

933
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:07,009
Eagle Rock! Exactly.

934
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,928
All right, thank you.
You live in Eagle Rock?

935
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,097
-Yeah, I do.
-That's so cool, man.

936
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,308
Can I get back to my story now?

937
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,642
I'm kidding.

938
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,186
[crowd claps]

939
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,605
Not even...

940
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,274
[crowd laughs]

941
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,905
She's very outdoorsy
and she loves to go hiking.

942
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,948
We would go to Eagle Rock
and shit like that.

943
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:30,866
It was a lot.

944
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:33,994
We actually went camping 
at Yosemite for, like, 10 days.

945
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,496
I fucking hate camping, all right?

946
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:37,706
I fucking hate that.

947
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,958
I mean, who wants to take a shit
in the woods,

948
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,460
-you know what I mean?
-[audience member] Yeah!

949
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,377
Think about that!

950
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,295
Who wants to--

951
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,630
Really? You love doing that?

952
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,214
You like digging a hole

953
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,968
and taking a fucking shit in the woods

954
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,387
and putting that dirt back on?

955
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,473
That's your idea of fun?

956
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:58,226
Not me. I'm more of a
Four Seasons type of gal, all right?

957
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,065
Not me, guys.

958
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,735
I won't even glamp as a millionaire, okay?

959
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:09,404
But that's the thing.

960
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:14,159
That's the fun of the courtship,
because you really want to prove yourself.

961
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:17,663
And, you know, everything changes
the moment we got married.

962
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:19,331
And the moment I fucking trapped her.

963
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,999
And it was just...

964
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:24,086
Because when we got home
from our honeymoon,

965
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,796
she was looking at the calendar.

966
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:28,840
"Oh, my God. I was just thinking, honey,
you love camping so much,

967
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,509
maybe we should go back to Yosemite
next month."

968
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:33,303
I'm like, "Oh, no, I paid my dues, Ho.

969
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:35,430
Off to the cinema!"

970
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,766
[crowd laughs]

971
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,439
All right guys, 
to be brutally honest, man,

972
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,400
I wanted to do stand-up because...

973
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,528
You know, throughout the last 10 years
of my life,

974
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:52,614
you have highs and lows,
and everything is all good.

975
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:55,701
And then you realize, man,
I'm nothing without my wife.

976
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,661
I'm nothing without my family.

977
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,870
It's true.

978
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,752
And the reason why I chose the Ice House

979
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:08,755
is because, for the very first time
that Tran saw me do comedy,

980
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,674
it was right here at the Ice House.

981
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,759
That's the reason why I wanted to do it.

982
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,636
It's full circle.

983
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,857
And my wife Tran
is a breast cancer survivor,

984
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,817
going on 10 years cancer-free.

985
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:31,153
[crowd cheers]

986
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,866
Ten years, cancer-free.

987
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,498
And she is the strongest person I know,
all right?

988
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,208
All right, here is her story.

989
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,170
Tran was breastfeeding Alexa and Zoey
when they were one year old

990
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,130
and she found a lump on her breast,
all right?

991
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:54,259
And then we had to get it biopsied
and it turned out to be benign,

992
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:55,385
according to the path report.

993
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,846
And we were fine with that.
This is great, it was benign.

994
00:50:57,971 --> 00:51:00,307
We're both doctors.
Okay, we'll see what it is.

995
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,808
Maybe it's an infection,
maybe it's something else.

996
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,644
And it got bigger,
and it got bigger and bigger.

997
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,939
And it wasn't getting better with
antibiotics or supportive therapy.

998
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,858
We got it re-biopsied, actually,

999
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,153
and it came back Stage 3 triple-negative
breast cancer,

1000
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,155
with a 23% chance of survival.

1001
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:17,741
Spoiler alert!
She's here right now, she's healthy.

1002
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,701
She's doing great.

1003
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,995
[cheers]

1004
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:24,623
She's doing great.

1005
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,003
You are the strongest person that I know,

1006
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,423
because two days before 
she started her chemotherapy,

1007
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:36,218
where she would lose all of her hair
and become really weak,

1008
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:39,846
she decided, she took her eight-hour
standardized board exam,

1009
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,640
the one that I failed,

1010
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:45,143
and she passed it with flying colors!

1011
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,646
[crowd cheers]

1012
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,654
And I'm thinking to myself,
"That Ho," you know?

1013
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:57,197
It's just so great.

1014
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:01,201
And she has had... She's such a champ.

1015
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,661
She has the presence of mind. She goes,

1016
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:04,538
"You know what?
I'm going to beat the cancer,

1017
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,456
so I might as well beat that exam."

1018
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,458
She is so clutch, man.

1019
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,128
She was like Reggie Miller
against the Knicks in '95,

1020
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,755
where she's scoring, like,
fucking eight points to beat...

1021
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,007
She's a Vietnamese Reggie Miller,
that's what she is.

1022
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:20,345
Or she's Vietnamese John Cena,
but she didn't do this fucking bullshit.

1023
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:21,805
You know what I mean?

1024
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,140
Sidebar.

1025
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:26,685
By the way, I hosted WWE Raw
with John Cena years ago

1026
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,562
and WWE asked me to host.

1027
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,896
They're like, "Do you want to do this?"

1028
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,356
"Sure, I'm an actor.

1029
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,776
I fake, wrestling's fake.
What could go wrong, all right?"

1030
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,780
And then, on the day,
John Cena lifts me up for a body slam,

1031
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,032
throws me over the top rope

1032
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,327
and the five motherfuckers
who were supposed to catch me...

1033
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,121
didn't.

1034
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,665
Wrestling is fucking real.

1035
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,959
[crowd laughs]

1036
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,503
He throws me over the top rope,

1037
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,006
I hit the concrete,
my head hits the wooden plank.

1038
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,592
You hear the sound of my head
hitting the plank.

1039
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,344
I had to call Tran after Raw
went off the air to assure her I'm okay.

1040
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,471
My whole point is,
John Cena absolutely sucks.

1041
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,764
He does, I'm just saying.

1042
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,730
But getting back to my wife,
a fucking miracle happened.

1043
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:15,817
After the first dose of chemotherapy,
after the first dose of adriamycin,

1044
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,235
all her cancer went away.

1045
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,445
It was amazing.

1046
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,447
We did a blood test, all normal.

1047
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,907
We did an MRI, all normal.

1048
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,618
PET scan, CAT scan,
ultrasound mammogram,

1049
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,535
all normal.

1050
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:29,456
It was a miracle from God, Allah,
Oprah or Tom Cruise.

1051
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,540
I tell you...

1052
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,127
I think it was Tommy, I really do.

1053
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:38,089
Which brings me, by the way,
to my next point,

1054
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:39,341
or my next medical tip.

1055
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:44,012
All right, dude, if any woman who wants to
get a mammogram for any reason,

1056
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:45,597
ask your doctor to get a mammogram.

1057
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:48,600
If you're concerned about breast cancer,
ask your doctor for a mammogram

1058
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:49,559
for any reason.

1059
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,937
And if that doctor says you can't get
a mammogram

1060
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,939
because you don't fall under the criteria,

1061
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,733
go to another fucking doctor who will
get you that mammogram, all right?

1062
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,736
That's what I'm passionate about.
We got to stand up to cancer.

1063
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,364
And that's what we got to do.

1064
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:12,582
And it was at the same point where we
found out Tran's cancer was gone

1065
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,335
I got offered the part
of Mr. Chow in The Hangover.

1066
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:16,753
And I turned it down, actually,

1067
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:19,589
because Tran had 12 more rounds
of chemo to go.

1068
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,174
You have to go full circle with that.

1069
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,344
You got to go, more chemo,
more radiation, more procedures.

1070
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,388
And I'm like,
"No, I don't want to leave my family."

1071
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,681
Tran was, like, "You got to do this.

1072
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:30,433
It's only like a four-day trip 
out in Vegas, you'll be fine.

1073
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,851
This will be healthy for you.

1074
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,063
You and I both know on the inside tip
that the cancer is gone."

1075
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:36,940
I'm like,
"No, I don't think I can do that."

1076
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:40,151
And it was actually Todd Phillips,
the writer-director of The Hangover.

1077
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:42,070
He did Old School with Vince Vaughn
and Will Ferrell.

1078
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,905
He convinced me to do the movie.

1079
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:48,493
Directors are, by nature, like,
fucking geniuses or evil manipulators.

1080
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,953
That's what they are.

1081
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,871
Like, in Hangover III,

1082
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,291
I was doing a scene with John Goodman
in a Bangkok prison,

1083
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,458
and I was just doing this scene,

1084
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,961
and there's a Thai toddler who's, like,
three years old,

1085
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:01,589
and basically I was, like,
trying to do some improv in my acting,

1086
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,091
hoping that scene will make it in.

1087
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,343
So I look at the toddler,
I surprise him, I go,

1088
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:06,803
"What are you looking at,
you little shit?"

1089
00:55:07,804 --> 00:55:09,973
And he starts crying.
You know, it was, like...

1090
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:11,975
So, it didn't make it into the movie.

1091
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:15,353
And then, so,
Todd comes out of the video booth.

1092
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:18,857
Like, "Chow, come on!"
And he's, like, yelling at me like a dog.

1093
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,816
He never calls me "Ken."

1094
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,444
He's like, "Bad Chow! Bad Chow,"
like a dog.

1095
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,404
If he had a newspaper,
he'd hit me with it.

1096
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,864
And it was, like, "Apologize!"

1097
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:27,115
I said, "I am so sorry."

1098
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,742
"Apologize to the mother!"

1099
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,577
-"I am so sorry."
-"Good!"

1100
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,120
And then he turns around
and whispers in my ear,

1101
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:33,079
"Do it again.

1102
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,206
Amazing."

1103
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:41,796
By the way, it was my idea
to get naked in The Hangover.

1104
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,883
Did you guys know that?
Yup, that's right.

1105
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,719
-Ha-ha!
-[claps]

1106
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,265
My wife said it'll be the feel-good movie
of the summer,

1107
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,186
because every guy will go home 
feeling good about themselves.

1108
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,481
That's my Ho, so...

1109
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:05,278
But if anyone, like, kind of broke me out
of my depression, it was Todd Phillips.

1110
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:08,865
And, by the way, like,
I didn't cry for six months, you know,

1111
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,159
because I wanted to be strong
for my family

1112
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:14,454
and I actually prescribed myself
antidepressants.

1113
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:20,460
Of all the shit I could prescribe myself,
like weed, oxycodone, all these drugs...

1114
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:23,838
Even the pharmacist looked at my script,
said, "Celexa? Pussy!"

1115
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:24,756
You know?

1116
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,345
"Wow, this is the most aggressive Rite Aid
I've ever been to."

1117
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,890
And when you're on an antidepressant,
you can't cry.

1118
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:34,974
Lord knows I tried.

1119
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,061
I tried stabbing myself in the balls,
manipulating my taint.

1120
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,730
Most of my approaches were genital-based.
Now...

1121
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:45,610
But if anyone broke me out of that spiral
and made me cry, it was Todd Phillips.

1122
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:48,780
This guy fucking saved my life,
'cause he went to me...

1123
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,781
Every day, he would say, like...

1124
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,742
Because he comes from a family
of oncologists, he knew the situation.

1125
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,412
He said, "Look, we don't have to
finish the movie with you in it.

1126
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,455
We can always do pickups and reshoots
around you."

1127
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,333
This is a big, blockbuster
Hollywood movie.

1128
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,710
No director will ever offer this,
but he said to me,

1129
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,547
"I will make sure that I'll fly you
from Vegas to LA

1130
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,173
every time Tran has her chemo."

1131
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:09,467
And he did. He did not have to do that.

1132
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:10,802
It was amazing.

1133
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,726
And on the last day of filming,

1134
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,771
Bradley Cooper actually drove me
from Vegas to LA

1135
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,857
to see Tran and to see how she was doing.

1136
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,150
These guys...

1137
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,401
Go back full-circle,

1138
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,486
Everyone's like,
"Why do you love The Hangover so much?"

1139
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,030
Why is it the best thing
that ever happened in my life?

1140
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,616
Because it saved my fucking life,
all right?

1141
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,035
It was so therapeutic to me.

1142
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:44,836
Even if I wasn't rich and famous,
which I am.

1143
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,840
And on my last day of filming,

1144
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:52,302
I got really emotional,
and for the first time in months,

1145
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,761
I just started breaking down and crying.

1146
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,054
I was like, "Thank you so much, man.

1147
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,515
You know, you have no idea
what you did for me."

1148
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,560
And I was just teary-eyed,
and I went in for a hug.

1149
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,728
And Todd's just like...

1150
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:03,813
because he's not a hugger.

1151
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,648
I'm like, "What the fuck, dude?
I just bared my soul to you."

1152
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,566
He goes...

1153
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:07,942
I was like, "What the--?"

1154
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:10,069
And then I realized my dick
was on his thigh.

1155
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,829
My whole point is, like my dick,
life is short, all right, guys?

1156
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,706
Take chances, be brave.

1157
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:26,252
Long story short, Tran is here doing well.
Ten years cancer-free.

1158
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,546
[crowd cheers]

1159
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,342
Our kids are doing great.

1160
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:39,516
There are new Hos sprouting up everywhere
across the land.

1161
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,643
[crowd laughs]

1162
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:45,104
And I have my first Netflix special
because of you guys.

1163
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:49,108
[loud cheering]

1164
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,159
For a bit of nostalgia,

1165
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:02,121
I love to do selfie videos at the end of
every show to encapsulate this.

1166
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,666
So I just want to kind of do this
really quick for you guys.

1167
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:07,585
It's like doing a movie. 
It's a lot of fun.

1168
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,589
-Guys, Ice House!
-[crowd cheers]

1169
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,676
Doing my first Netflix special!

1170
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,054
You guys have a good time?

1171
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,390
[crowd cheers]

1172
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:25,395
[claps]

1173
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:28,189
Wow, let me meet some people.

1174
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,567
This is a Ho.

1175
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,778
And this is a Ho.

1176
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,991
But my favorite Ho is in the back.

1177
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,285
[crowd cheers]

1178
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,662
And this is my favorite club.

1179
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:44,706
Love you, Ice House!
Love you, Netflix!

1180
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,083
Toodle-oo, motherfuckers!

1181
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,461
Thank you guys so much.

1182
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,338
Thank you. Love you guys.

1183
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,508
[loud cheering]

1184
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,697
Dana Lee! Why don't you stand up, man?

1185
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:02,200
He played my father, DK.

1186
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,285
Come on! Come on up here, Dana.

1187
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:06,287
Come on up here.

1188
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,123
-You gonna cut this?
-Oh, fuck, yeah, I'm gonna cut this.

1189
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:10,541
No, you're not gonna be in this.

1190
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:16,005
And, by the way, one of the stars of
The Joy Luck Club is here.

1191
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,256
We'll just get a camera on her.

1192
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,927
I know she doesn't want it.
Give it up her for Ming-Na, right there.

1193
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:31,479
See, Dana? She didn't come up here 
like a whore, and just like...

1194
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:36,401
And to make things even more full-circle,

1195
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,529
the director of my Netflix special,
Jon Chu...

1196
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:42,031
is right here.

1197
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,331
All right, dude, you don't have to
fucking stand for him,

1198
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,457
you know what I mean?

1199
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,460
I just wanted you guys to wave, man.

1200
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,713
This is my fucking show, Jon.

1201
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,297
What the fuck?
