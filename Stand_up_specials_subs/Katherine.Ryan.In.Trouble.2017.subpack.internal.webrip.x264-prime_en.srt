00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,000
<i>Relax.</i>

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,360
<i>Relax.</i>

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,160
<i>Whoa.</i>

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,240
<i>Whoa. Relax.</i>

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,680
<i>Relax.</i>

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,440
<i>Shh.</i>

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

8
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,320
<i>boys and girls,</i>

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,560
<i>she's a strong, confident, black woman.</i>

10
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
<i>It's Katherine Ryan!</i>

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,520
Thank you. Thank you.

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,480
Thank you. Yes, thank you.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,840
This is so amazing, the Eventim Apollo.
OMG.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,080
I've been living in the U.K.
for a very long time,

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,760
and I used to be an unwelcome surprise
on a mixed bill,

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,640
and now I can see
that at least a third of you

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,960
have come to see me on purpose.

18
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,400
I was just a little girl
when I moved here,

19
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,760
and look at me now.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,680
I'm full-blown Caitlyn Jenner,
and it feels good.

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,576
It feels so great. I spent so long wanting
to look like one of the Kardashians,

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,240
I don't even give a fuck it's the dad.

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,960
I'll take it.

24
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,760
I'll take it.

25
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,880
She is a majestic hero.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,680
I see some of you are taking pictures.

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,400
The venue will have told you
not to do that, but you can.

28
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,320
I did not get dressed up
by fucking accident, okay?

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,720
Take a lot. Facetune them.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,400
Try not to use the flash.
Try not to use the flash, sir.

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,120
There we go. Let's just stop for you.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
Thank you.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,680
How old are you little girls?

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,920
Twenty-four. And this one?

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,000
Twenty-three! You're 23 and 24.

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, my gosh. I thought you were,
like, little baby teenagers.

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,440
Well done. You giggle like teenagers.

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,200
Why are you acting like that?

39
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,800
Do you think I'm a footballer? I'm not.

40
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,760
Gorgeous, gorgeous.

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,280
A lot of young women
really respond to my style.

42
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,000
Do we have any teenage girls in?

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,360
Sir, you're not on the Internet.
We can see you.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
- You've brought a teenager with you?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Like...

46
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,080
Like, for ransom, she's here.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,320
Are you her? Are you her?

48
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm her father.

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,880
Okay, thank fuck for that.

50
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,120
He's her father.

51
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,680
So, you brought your daughter out tonight.
And how old is your teenage daughter?

52
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,280
- I'm 17.
- You're 17! Well done.

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,696
Listen, she has her own voice.
She's, like, "I can speak for myself!

54
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,080
I'm 17 years old!"

55
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,480
Good for you.
So, like, a daddy-daughter night out.

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,360
Well done. What do you, mean, like... no?

57
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,880
Well, my mum doesn't quite get
what you do sometimes.

58
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:55,600
Oh. She just very nicely told me
that her mom hates everything I do.

59
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,560
And sure, that's fine.

60
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,600
That's cool, thank you.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,160
Well, sweetheart,
if we all liked the same thing,

62
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,280
we'd all be married to your father.

63
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,936
That's cool. I think it's really great
that you brought your 17-year-old.

64
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,160
- What's your name?
- Lara.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,880
Lara. I love her great, big voice.
Lara is here with her dad.

66
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,040
I've been on tour for a while,
as I mentioned,

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,160
and a couple came up to me,
and they were, like...

68
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,120
"Our teenage
daughter really likes you,

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,400
and we're very glad
that we did not bring her."

70
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,640
I was, like...

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,160
"All right, why didn't you bring her?"

72
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,880
They're, like, "Well, she's 14,
and after having seen what you do,

73
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,496
we're very pleased we left her at home."

74
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,160
And I'm, like, "Well, she's sucking dick
at home. But go on."

75
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,560
Isn't she? Lara's, like, "Yeah, yeah."

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
And you left Mum at home.

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,320
My daughter is here as well.

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,760
And she doesn't listen to everything,
but I do use some naughty words,

79
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,440
and on the surface,
that can sound, like, really bad.

80
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,680
But I don't think
those kinds of words are bad.

81
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,880
I have a lot of powerful messages.
Don't I, Lara?

82
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,760
That's why she's here. Yeah.
I care about Lara.

83
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,120
Lara's my hero. Lara's the future.

84
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,400
And when I was your age, Lara,
if someone spoke to me in a comedy show...

85
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,560
First of all, I wouldn't be
in a comedy show.

86
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,160
Secondly, I'd be, like, "Meow."

87
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,920
Like, I had no idea.

88
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,520
Do we have any women in
who are over the age of 30?

89
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,840
How dare you?

90
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
How dare you? "I know. We should've
killed ourselves five years ago."

91
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,960
You're right.

92
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,800
I'm 32 years old,
and I love getting older.

93
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,200
I think we grow in value with every day,
not the other way around.

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,600
Aging just means you didn't die.

95
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,000
But if you have to, if you insist
upon growing beyond the age of 18,

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,440
you can get away with it if you just
look and act like a baby. Okay?

97
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,280
So, like, just talk like a baby.

98
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,840
Like, do this voice
even though you're 45.

99
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,440
And shrink yourself.
That's what dieting is.

100
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,520
We want you to be smaller
so that you take up less space.

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,840
That's not your space.
What if a man wants to golf in it?

102
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,480
Are any women in the Apollo tonight
with younger men?

103
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,240
All of us. Look at...

104
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,760
Well done. Well done.

105
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,760
You will see women
who are with younger men,

106
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,000
but I promise that happened by accident,

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,560
and it will not be a big age difference.

108
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,280
It is a mistake to think we seek it out,
like it's a badge of honor.

109
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,080
We're not out in the clubs, like,

110
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,400
"Hmm. Who can I find to do everything for
and teach everything to?

111
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,600
Ooh.

112
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,320
I am not busy enough."

113
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
No.

114
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,200
We do not have time to make
an extra packed lunch every morning.

115
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,880
I recently went home with a 25-year-old.

116
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,960
Whoo!

117
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
I know. Ew. No, it was weird.

118
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,080
I have not been with a 25-year-old
since I was... well, 14.

119
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,200
But...

120
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,080
Accidentally, I fell in love with him,
but it was over very quickly.

121
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,680
He said something insane.
He said to me, "Katherine,

122
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,520
did you know <i>Titanic</i>
was based on a true story?"

123
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
I was, like, "Get out." And that was it.

124
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,440
That was it.

125
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,160
But another thing I've learned
about myself, getting older,

126
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,720
is that I shouldn't be in a relationship.
That's not for all of us.

127
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
Do we have any single people in?

128
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,600
Well done. See? They're not sad.

129
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,200
I go on dates now, and that's okay,

130
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,320
but I've learned not to settle down
with anyone,

131
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:46,680
because I have a tendency to settle down
with very, very terrible sex-piratey men.

132
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,240
Like, really... Like, the kind of dudes
blind dogs bark at, you know?

133
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,280
You know?

134
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,840
Don't do this, by the way,

135
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
because you're hurting your parents
if you do.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,360
That's who suffers.

137
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,520
My dad is a pretty good guy.
He's done nothing wrong.

138
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,240
But he looks at my choices, like,
"What the fuck?

139
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,200
Did I molest her and forget?

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,560
Who's this bitch mad at?

141
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,400
If you figure it out, let me know."

142
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,120
And I believe that there are wonderful men
in the world.

143
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,960
Give me a cheer if you're a wonderful man.

144
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,280
Good, good. Well done, lads.

145
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,560
I dated a Jewish man
at the beginning of the year.

146
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,120
Accidentally, I fell in love with him.

147
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,680
And then he split up with me...
I know, with <i>me...</i>

148
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,200
simply because I'm not Jewish.

149
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,000
What? I genuinely did not know
that religions still behaved that way.

150
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,560
What? I'm a blond-haired, blue-eyed,
white, middle-class woman in 2016.

151
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,880
I am entitled to everything.

152
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,480
It is not okay for his people to treat me

153
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,960
the way my people quite enjoy treating
everyone else.

154
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,520
He said, "My parents
don't approve of you, Katherine."

155
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,480
Oh! He said, "We have no future.
What if we were to have a baby?

156
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,880
I imagine you would not consent
to having that baby circumcised."

157
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,680
And I was, like, "Why are you imagining
the dicks of babies we don't have?"

158
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,400
But you know what? He's right.
I probably wouldn't.

159
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,440
And that's not very North American of me.

160
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,360
He highlighted one of the many ways
that I've changed, living among you.

161
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,120
Back home in North America,
Jewish or not,

162
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,400
all the men are routinely circumcised.
I checked that myself.

163
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,040
And here,
it's just not the done thing, is it?

164
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,600
He said, "Well, Katherine,
you could have a chance with this

165
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,440
if you abandoned your beliefs
and your culture,

166
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,960
everything that you grew up with.

167
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,440
If you just converted
and you were Jewish as well,

168
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,120
then maybe we could be together."

169
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,360
And I considered it, and I said, "Well,
would that mean giving up Christmas?"

170
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,480
He's, like, "Yeah, Katherine,
obviously it would."

171
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,840
And I was, like, "So, you think
you got a dick better than Christmas?!

172
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,080
No, no, no, no.

173
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,760
Mate, I've seen a lot of dicks in my day.

174
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,880
I've seen a few Easter-level dicks, maybe.

175
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
Maybe.

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,560
I've seen a lot of Halloween dicks.
You don't want to go anywhere near those.

177
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,440
I've not seen any Christmas dicks.
Not one."

178
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,480
And now, through no fault of my own,
I've got to walk around having...

179
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,120
like, a problem with Jews.

180
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't want that.
I'm a very progressive person.

181
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,920
And of course not, I don't hate all Jews.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,040
But I hate one Jew,
and that's how it starts, isn't it?

183
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,480
It's very disappointing.

184
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,080
It's sad, because I think
I'm a very nice girl,

185
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,200
but my comedy has been described
as kind of nasty.

186
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,640
I'm like... They say I'm Joan Rivers,
but older. And that hurts.

187
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,416
Because parts of her are younger.

188
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,520
And hey, that lady got exactly
what she wanted from her final surgery:

189
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,200
To stop aging. So, why are we sad?

190
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,880
Why are we sad?

191
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,600
Finally, she nailed it.

192
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,480
Good to know.

193
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,560
I know what you've read
about American comedian Bill Cosby.

194
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,440
And it's something that we talk about
within the comedy community,

195
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,880
something certainly that I talk about
as a woman.

196
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,000
And I understand why he's confused.

197
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,200
You see him going into the courtroom,
accused of sexual assault charges.

198
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,600
And he's so confused, like:
"I don't understand it.

199
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,160
All my friends were raping people."
He doesn't know.

200
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,480
Because I know you're all very young,
you're very gorgeous,

201
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,800
but Bill Cosby was just raping people
back when it was frowned upon.

202
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,856
Do you remember?
Does anyone remember the good old days

203
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,800
when it was, like,
"Try not to rape anyone.

204
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,960
Definitely don't jump out of the bushes
and rape someone."

205
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,640
If you have to rape someone,

206
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,320
just be famous
and make it look like it was her fault.

207
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,360
Hugh Hefner must be shitting himself.

208
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,080
And not just because he's 95 years old.

209
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,160
You cannot ask Bill Cosby
if he's a rapist.

210
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,400
He hates that.
I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.

211
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,920
But if you ask Bill Cosby
if he raped those women in an interview,

212
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,080
he will storm out of the interview.

213
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,376
This is something I've learned, though,
on tour. Watch this.

214
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,136
Gentlemen, hello.
Thank you for sitting in front.

215
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,640
Looking gorge.
Have you ever raped anyone?

216
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,960
No. Smiling.
He's an angel. Of course not.

217
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,720
Have you ever raped anyone, sir?

218
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,040
No. Have you ever raped anyone?
Have you ever raped anyone?

219
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,560
Madam, have you ever... No.
Have you ever raped anyone, madam?

220
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,600
Have you ever raped anyone?
Are the two of you together?

221
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,880
That's nice.
Ever raped anyone as a couple?

222
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,520
Because that happens. No?

223
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,640
You ever raped anyone? Great, thank you.
Well done. Neither have I.

224
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,040
You know who hates being asked
if they're a rapist, though?

225
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,280
Rapists. They don't like it.

226
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I'm sorry for what I had to ask you,

227
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,320
but what you just witnessed
was a CRB check.

228
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,960
They did not storm out.

229
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,760
It's just a clue. I'm not a policeman.
I've never pretended...

230
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,480
All right, one time
I pretended to be a policeman.

231
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,760
But the Manitowoc County needed me
to leave a key and skedaddle.

232
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
I did that.

233
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,680
I did that for them.

234
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,000
But on a serious note, a lot of the women
who were allegedly assaulted by Mr. Cosby

235
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,320
were strong, powerful,
beautiful black women like me.

236
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,480
And...

237
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,160
And when asked,
"Why didn't you say anything?"

238
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,440
Ha! In addition to the many reasons
why victims don't come forward,

239
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,360
these women were, like,
"Hang on a minute. Look at the times."

240
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,960
Because it didn't happen today.
Though it still happens today.

241
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,240
Free Kesha.

242
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,400
They were, like, "It happened..."

243
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,800
It happened a very long time ago,

244
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,920
when these were struggling,
young, black actresses in America,

245
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,840
and Mr. Cosby,
a black man in the '80s there,

246
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,880
was dominating television.

247
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,200
They said, "I didn't really feel
like it was in my greater interest

248
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,560
to bring that man down."

249
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,040
And I have to tell you, on some level,
as a female comedian,

250
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,880
I kind of get that.

251
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:08,640
Tina Fey could be raping me now,
and I would tell no one.

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,160
Amy Schumer could be wearing me
like a watch,

253
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,720
and I'd just be, like...

254
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,200
Shit.

255
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,720
Thank you...

256
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,520
for everything that you do for women
in our industry.

257
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,240
Guys, I've been on tour for a year now
in the U.K.,

258
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,200
and this is the last stop.
And it's so amazing,

259
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,720
because I get to choose
some of my very favorite comedians

260
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,360
and ask them nicely
if they'll support me on tour.

261
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,560
And that makes me a hero.
It really does.

262
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,640
Taylor Swift does that when she's on tour.

263
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,280
I'm like Taylor Swift, but with a soul.

264
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,440
I know.
Do we have any Taylor Swift fans in?

265
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,680
Yeah! Of course we are!

266
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,160
Of course we love her. Shake it off.

267
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,520
Taylor Swift...
Taylor is all about the fans, isn't she?

268
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,120
She's all about the sisterhood.

269
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,440
Except if you follow Taylor Swift
on Instagram, as I do,

270
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,840
you will notice that sisterhood
is limited to Victoria's Secret models.

271
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,920
And Lena Dunham, for some reason.

272
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,800
She's an incredible woman,
but she sticks out.

273
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,800
Victoria's Secret model,
Victoria's Secret model,

274
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,680
Taylor Swift, Victoria's Secret model,

275
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,280
Lena Dunham, oh, no.

276
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,840
What's she there for?

277
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,800
It's because Taylor Swift
doesn't care about us.

278
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,080
She doesn't actually want
to be our friend.

279
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
That is an insurance policy
for her Girl Squad.

280
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,040
If I was ever in a room with Taylor Swift

281
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,080
and I got a chance to be, like,
"Taylor! Can I be friends with you?"

282
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,720
She'd be, like, "Eww, no.
I'm already friends with one human woman.

283
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,200
Get her, Lena. Gross.

284
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,840
Gross!"

285
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,480
Taylor Swift's the boss.

286
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,520
She's the gatekeeper
of the most exquisite pussy in America.

287
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,120
But she's not perfect. Nobody's perfect.

288
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,720
I knew that Taylor Swift would mess up
if I watched her,

289
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,280
so I did watch her...

290
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,240
like a psycho.

291
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,040
And then, a few months ago, Nicki Minaj,
a very curvaceous black rapper...

292
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,400
"Anaconda." Are you a fan? I knew it.

293
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,280
Yes. She tweeted, "I think I would have
been nominated for more awards this year

294
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,200
if the women in my videos were slim."

295
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,040
Hmm. And, essentially, white.

296
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,560
And Taylor Swift, friend to all women,
tweeted,

297
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,240
"Hey, Nicki, I have always supported you.

298
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,240
When I win, you can come onstage with me."

299
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,520
I was, like,
"Hmm, your white privilege is showing."

300
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,160
What has Nicki Minaj accomplished
in her own right?

301
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,120
Very deserving of her own awards.
What is she supposed to say? "Thank you"?

302
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,120
"Oh, th-th-thank you, Taylor Swift!

303
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
That's ever so kind of you, ma'am.

304
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,960
No, no, I don't know. I don't know
if I got no business up here on stage.

305
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,640
In front of all these white folk.

306
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
No, I better hurry up.

307
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,760
I gotta finish the laundry
before your daddy get home."

308
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,480
But maybe she just made a mistake.
She's just a little baby, born in 1989.

309
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,120
Maybe I'd be saying stuff like that
if I, too, was from Louisiana.

310
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,920
Do we have any Americans in, by the way?

311
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,720
That's what they sound like. You hear it?

312
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,680
"Texas! Welcome."

313
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,680
America is a terrifying place.
America is a terrifying place.

314
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,120
Especially when this goes out.

315
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,520
We either have a female president,
or we're in the middle of a world war.

316
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,480
I kind of think America should vote
for Donald Trump at this point.

317
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,880
I think that's the president
America deserves.

318
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm not gonna lie.

319
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,160
And I'm from Canada.
A lot of Americans...

320
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,560
Oh, do we have any Canadians in?
Or have you just heard of it?

321
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,600
Look, look, look, boys.

322
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,080
Do you know that Americans are saying
they're gonna sneak into our country?

323
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,921
I mean, they don't say "sneak."
Americans think they can just come in,

324
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,120
like we have no immigration policy
whatsoever.

325
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,760
Like we'd be glad to have them.

326
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,840
It'd be very difficult at border control
to smuggle an American into a country.

327
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:14,040
You'd hear a very proud but muscled
"Florida State!" from under the truck.

328
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Shh.

329
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,960
Donald Trump has made refugees
of his own people

330
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,400
by hating refugees.

331
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,200
Some Canadians think
that we should copy Donald Trump

332
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,120
and build our own wall.

333
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,560
And I don't know about that,

334
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,320
but Americans are not even
as physically fit as Mexicans.

335
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,080
It wouldn't need to be a high wall.

336
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,680
There you go.

337
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,680
A sea bump should do it.

338
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,920
They're, like, "Oh, never mind."

339
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,760
But welcome, to the Americans.

340
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,120
They're the ones that got out.

341
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,560
Welcome to the show.

342
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,400
It's so nice to see you here. Welcome.

343
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,280
My name is TV's Katherine Ryan,

344
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,560
and it's so amazing to be here.

345
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,560
I've been away from home
a really long time,

346
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,240
but I have to go back
because my baby sister is getting married.

347
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,480
Ooh! And it's about time.

348
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,480
Tick-tock. She's 25 years old.

349
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,360
She's an old spinster in my hometown,

350
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,080
perhaps the oldest single woman left.

351
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
I'm from Canada, which sounds lovely,

352
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,640
but I'm from a terrible part of Canada.

353
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,640
Let me ask you this:
Has anyone traveled to Canada?

354
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,160
Well done. You all went together.
Where did you go, sir?

355
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,000
- Toronto.
- Toronto. And what did you do there?

356
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
- Went out.
- Went out? All right.

357
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,400
No need to be hostile.
Were you there for business or pleasure?

358
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,680
You were there on holiday.
Did you go in the winter?

359
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,960
- Summer.
- Summer.

360
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,136
Gorgeous. You must've done
so many things in the city.

361
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Go to the top of the Tower and look down
like a fucking giant.

362
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,520
You're pretty big anyway.
Do you work out?

363
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,880
- No.
- No. Good. Are you very tall?

364
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,480
- Six-four.
- Six-foot-four. I knew it.

365
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,080
There's some big men around here.

366
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,560
You must do some training,
like, for a zombie apocalypse.

367
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,840
That's what it looks like.

368
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,280
You're just big naturally?
Your mother fucked a steroid.

369
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,480
That's all it took.

370
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,600
That's good.

371
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,400
I wish I was tall like that.

372
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,400
Do you come Gatorade
without working out?

373
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
No.

374
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,520
I'm just curious.

375
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,440
This is why I'm alone, by the way.
This is it.

376
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,400
I don't mean to do it.

377
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,320
- What's your name?
- Adrian.

378
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,080
Adrian. Do you know I went home with a guy
in Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago.

379
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,360
<i>♪ About a week ago ♪</i>

380
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,520
Has anyone been to Edinburgh?

381
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,080
Yeah. Really nice, tall men there.

382
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,960
I went home with him,
and then he didn't call me for three days.

383
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,240
I'm not asking you to find him
and kill him.

384
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,560
But on the third day, I rang him,
didn't I?

385
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,880
Like, "What the fuck is up?"
Just really chill.

386
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,200
And I think what had happened

387
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,560
is I'd given him
a too-aggressive blowjob, Adrian.

388
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,360
Well, it's not my fault,
because the guy before

389
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,600
was just really, like,
one of these sex pirates, and he had...

390
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,536
like, a dead dick.
You could slam it in a door

391
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,640
and he felt nothing.

392
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,520
And we learn to be more aggressive
with those.

393
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,600
And so, I was, like,
"Why haven't you called me?"

394
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,520
And he was, like, "Oh, I'm really sorry.
I was in Loch Ness with my friends,

395
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,520
searching for the Loch Ness Monster..."

396
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,640
an excuse that I accepted.

397
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,120
And I could've just had
a normal interaction.

398
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,016
I could've retained some dignity
and put the phone down,

399
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,920
but instead I heard myself, like,
from the heavens, saying,

400
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,800
"Oh, the Loch Ness Monster.

401
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,920
So, you'll chase a myth,
but not a legend?"

402
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I said that.

403
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,400
Who says that?

404
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,560
There's no way.

405
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,080
Anyway, I'm working right now,
so I have to go over there.

406
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,040
But I'm glad that we could share
this secret.

407
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,240
Has anyone else traveled to Canada?

408
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,320
- Where'd you go?
- Vancouver.

409
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,680
Vancouver. That's the really pretty bit.
Has anyone else been there?

410
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,200
That's the bit that we put on the posters.

411
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
Did you see whales?

412
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,761
- You didn't see any whales?
- We went up Grouse Mountain.

413
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,000
- But you went up Grass Mountain?
- Grouse Mountain.

414
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,880
Grouse Mountain?
Oh, they smoke a lot of drugs there.

415
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,640
I thought they had, like,
a grass mountain,

416
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:01,480
and they're, like,
"Come and climb our grass mountain."

417
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,960
Mountains.
See, I'm from nowhere like that.

418
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,280
I'm from a part of Canada
that's almost America.

419
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,520
It's right on the bottom.
Has anyone traveled to Sarnia?

420
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,136
You have traveled to Sarnia?
Or are you just cheering

421
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,680
because it sounds like Narnia,
but with more sandwiches?

422
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,320
Right?

423
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,840
Sarnia is a terrible, horrible place.

424
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,960
A lot of people are proud
of their hometown.

425
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,320
Sarnia is a terrible, horrible,
awful place.

426
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,080
I just want to double down on that
and make it very clear.

427
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,080
We have the biggest petrochemical plant
in all of North America.

428
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,640
I know. And it pours poison into the air
and into the sea,

429
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,200
but officially, it's very safe.

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,880
It is. The owner of the plant, Mr. Burns,
tells us all the time.

431
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,720
Health and safety there is excellent.

432
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,000
We are the teen cancer, teen suicide
and teen pregnancy capital of Canada.

433
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,880
Thank you. I know.

434
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,360
We nearly lost teen suicide.
We're near to St. Catharines.

435
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,720
But then they had a really nice summer,
and we won.

436
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,000
And I'm a prick,
because I left my baby sister there.

437
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,240
I mean, my parents had other children.

438
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:20,560
By "other children," I mean Joanne,
but nobody likes Joanne.

439
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,200
Everybody has a Joanne in their family.

440
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,600
Joanne went away as well,
but she went to the west coast.

441
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,120
Not Vancouver, but she went up
into the mountains of Kelowna.

442
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,000
Has anyone been there?
Oh. Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it?

443
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,200
Joanne belongs there,

444
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,240
because she's the most Canadian person
I've ever met, eh?

445
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,840
Oh, yeah.
Joanne walks like this all the time.

446
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,240
Doesn't have a horse. Just walks this way.

447
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:51,680
Joanne lives up in the mountains
with her Canadian rock musician husband.

448
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,480
A Canadian rock musician
is like a Christian rock musician

449
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,680
without a reason for sucking, by the way.

450
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,120
Joanne loves the planet.
She loves the whole planet.

451
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,680
So, she makes all her own clothes
on a loom, eh?

452
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Oh, yeah, yeah.

453
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,520
Joanne has no TV, man. She has no phone.
So, I'm not really in contact with Joanne.

454
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,600
But if you happen to see her,
do tell her from me

455
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,200
she is not a fucking bear.

456
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,440
I have no idea where Joanne came from.

457
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,000
The most logical explanation I have

458
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,960
is that Mum cheated on Dad
with a granola bar.

459
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,120
We don't know.

460
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,960
Something we have all tried.

461
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,600
But the baby, Kerrie...

462
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,720
Kerrie and I were thick as thieves.

463
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,280
I mean, we were thieves.
And she's very thick,

464
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,160
but I say that in the nicest way.

465
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,040
Everybody always liked Kerrie
growing up in Sarnia.

466
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,400
Everyone hated me.

467
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,920
Kerrie was far more beautiful,
far less weird,

468
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,160
but we got on,
even though we were different.

469
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,776
And this is one of the ways
that we're different.

470
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,040
So, in year two growing up in Sarnia,

471
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,920
you had to write your academic goals
for the year, and mine was:

472
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,240
"To be the first female Prime Minister
to win an Academy Award."

473
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,400
I have no idea why they beat me up
every day.

474
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,320
And Kerrie's was: "Not to get hit
in the head with a football."

475
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,440
So...

476
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,160
neither one of us achieved
our academic goals that year,

477
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,880
but we both aimed high.

478
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,360
And I think what kept us friends
is we had a lot of games that we played,

479
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,520
before things like iPads.

480
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,120
And do you have the game Relax
in the U.K.?

481
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,720
Do you play Relax?

482
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,640
Okay, so, what it is is I would see Kerrie
at any point around the house,

483
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:37,920
and if I wanted to play,
I would say, "Hey, Kerrie, relax."

484
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,960
And she'd be, like, "I'm already relaxed."

485
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,720
And I'd be, like, "Whoa. Whoa. Relax."

486
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,640
She'd be, like, "Kat, what are you doing?"

487
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:51,160
I'm, like, "Relax, relax.
You've got to relax."

488
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,280
She'd be, like,
"I could not be more relaxed."

489
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,800
I'd be, like, "Shh.

490
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,800
Relax."

491
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,400
She'd be, like, "Katherine!
I am already relaxed!"

492
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,080
At which point my dad...
who's very big and mean and Irish

493
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,536
and didn't let us shout in the house...

494
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,560
he'd come stomping up the stairs, like,
"Who's shouting in the house?"

495
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
And she'd be, like...

496
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,920
"Well, Katherine... told me... to relax."

497
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,480
And he'd be, like, "Well, look at you.
You should relax."

498
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,960
And she'd be punished.
It's a great game.

499
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,440
Oh, you do know it. Yeah.

500
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,680
Hours and days and, like, years of fun
playing Relax.

501
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,120
And now, for no reason whatsoever,

502
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,320
Kerrie has aligned herself
with my enemies.

503
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,920
I went home for the hen do.
I'm the maid of honor. Of course I am.

504
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,720
But the other bridesmaids
are the same girls

505
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,080
who tried to ruin my life
when we were in school.

506
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,080
Now, it's very difficult to ruin the life
of a child

507
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,120
who's got the confidence
of an 89-year-old man.

508
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
But it doesn't stop them trying.

509
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,000
So, this was in the days
before, like, cyber-bullying.

510
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,400
These kids made a newspaper,
which they copied and distributed,

511
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,160
and inside, it slagged off my friends.

512
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,920
But on the cover was a picture of me
next to a picture of a camel,

513
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,320
and it said, "Thank God for makeup."

514
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,200
Yeah, insinuating that I look
like a camel,

515
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,080
when I feel I've always looked
like a horse.

516
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,136
I don't know why they had to bring
the Middle East into it.

517
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,320
They've been through enough.

518
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,120
Except when I wear a topknot, girls,
and then I am a unicorn. Hey.

519
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,320
It didn't bother me.

520
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,536
If anything, I thought they could've made
the headline stronger.

521
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,160
If you want to go with camel,
then be, like, "Camel, head to toe."

522
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,200
Like, something... Like...
Kids would've loved that.

523
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,600
So, my friends were wounded
because they were in this newspaper.

524
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,600
They ran home crying.
I went about my 89-year-old day.

525
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,280
And the headmaster dragged me
into his office.

526
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,040
The entire suicide prevention squad
were there.

527
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,600
And he was, like, "Katherine,
we are most worried about you, eh?

528
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,760
Because you are the only one
who appears to be not upset."

529
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,360
They thought I was, like,
planning a school shooting.

530
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
That's fine.

531
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,720
And I had to tell him, "Sir, no.

532
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,000
It's just that I ran out of fucks to give
in the spring of '85.

533
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,680
Like, I just don't care."

534
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,880
Yes. My fuck budget is low.

535
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
And I wish this for all of you.

536
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,960
Of course there are things
you should care about:

537
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,000
Your morals and yourself and your family.

538
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,320
But the rest is just nothing,
and I'm so blessed to have this outlook,

539
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,360
because I get to do British panel shows.

540
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,680
God bless the British panel shows.
They are the reason I eat.

541
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,800
But...

542
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,680
Sorry about all those.
But I did one a year ago,

543
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,360
and the game was: Name unlikely things
to hear from a cosmetics company.

544
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,080
And I don't know why, but I said,
"We don't test our products on animals.

545
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,640
We use Filipino children instead."

546
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,600
Now, of course you know I was not
aiming this at Filipino children,

547
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,560
or at any children.

548
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,720
I was just trying to make a point
about child labor.

549
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,080
Because, see,
I have a Canada Goose jacket.

550
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Has anyone else got
a really warm winter jacket?

551
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
You need it. You need to get involved.

552
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,800
But in London,
people will come up to me in the street

553
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,320
and tell me that I'm a prick
for wearing it.

554
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,720
They'll be, like, "Did you know the hood
is made from dead coyotes?"

555
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,040
And I'm, like, "What am I gonna do
with a live coyote?"

556
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Because...

557
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,920
"Mama gotta stay warm."

558
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,480
And I know the world that we live in,

559
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,640
and I know that I'm a prick
for wearing fur,

560
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,840
but right now it's not illegal.
It's just frowned upon.

561
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,920
Make hay while the sun shines.

562
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,800
Yes, one day, I will be walking
into a courtroom, confused,

563
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,480
like, "But all of my friends
had Canada Goose jackets.

564
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,360
What?

565
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,360
It's not like I jumped out of the bushes
and attacked those geese myself.

566
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,600
They were just in the shop,
asking to be bought.

567
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,760
Don't you think they would want to be worn
by someone on television?"

568
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,280
Don't come after me
for wearing a fur jacket

569
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,800
if yours cost £6
and you have 30 in your closet,

570
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,760
because I promise a child made those.

571
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,320
We're all pricks.

572
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,440
But I what I learned from this experience

573
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,040
is that the Filipino culture is one
that shares music and art

574
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,440
and tiny clips of <i>Mock the Week</i>
without context.

575
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,880
And if one person has seen something
in the Philippines,

576
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,480
somehow every person in the Philippines
has seen it.

577
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,760
I was the dentist
who killed Cecil the lion

578
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,720
for two weeks in the Philippines.

579
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,240
I was on CNN, and I got death threats.
Like, not one or two.

580
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,640
Hundreds of death threats every day

581
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,800
directed at me, my family, my child,

582
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:11,120
from people who were hurt
because they were confused.

583
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,256
And I know they were confused
because they were, like,

584
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,840
"You shut down
your cosmetic company now!"

585
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
And I was, like, "Never!
It's a family business!"

586
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,240
I could've maybe reined it in.

587
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:32,080
But during that time, Apollo,
you won't believe it.

588
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,400
Joan Rivers herself spoke to me
from down in heaven.

589
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,800
I know.

590
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,920
And she was, like,
"Katherine, it is not your fault

591
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,360
the Filipino people are as bad
at understanding satire

592
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,440
as they are at running from tsunamis."

593
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,360
And I was, like, "Holy shit!

594
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,440
Oh, my God!"

595
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,040
What a terrible bitch she was, right?

596
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,840
It's an example of the type
of horrible joke that I would never tell.

597
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,240
I don't ever mean to hurt anybody.

598
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,120
We tell our children,
"Those bullies, they grow out of it."

599
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,440
No, some of them grow much stronger.

600
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,880
I went home for the hen do,

601
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,760
and those same girls
I knew from school were there,

602
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,760
and they were, like, "So, Katherine,
we haven't seen you in a long time.

603
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,480
Where's your husband?"

604
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,880
And I was, like,
"Oh, I don't have a husband."

605
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,160
They were, like,
"Oh, why? Did he die?"

606
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
I was, like...

607
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,080
"No, I've just never been married."

608
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,160
They were, like...

609
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,560
"Where do you live?!"

610
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,000
I was, like, "I live in the U.K."

611
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,160
They were, like, "Cool. Where's that?"
I was, like, "Don't worry about it.

612
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,960
I have a lovely daughter,

613
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,640
and I get to travel around
doing stand-up comedy."

614
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,680
They were, like,
"What?! That's so weird!

615
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,640
Don't do that.
Like, that job is for a man,

616
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,480
and nobody is ever gonna love you
if you do it,

617
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,480
because it shows how weird you are.

618
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,920
Like, if you want someone
to ever, ever love you,

619
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,160
then you need to move home
and be normal like us."

620
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,840
And I was, like,
"Yeah, but you bitches aren't normal.

621
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,760
You're ordinary. It's different."

622
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,520
Thank you.

623
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,440
Thanks, guys.

624
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,600
But I get letters, not just death threats.
Not bragging.

625
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,560
I get letters exclusively from women
who are worried that I'm single.

626
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,376
I got one a while ago from a lady
who must've been, like, 200 years old.

627
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,920
She'd written it on stationary,
beautiful calligraphy.

628
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,040
It's a dead art, kids. Get involved.

629
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,840
And she wrote,
"Dear Katherine, we saw your show,

630
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,800
and we were very worried to hear
that you're single."

631
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,800
I was, like, "What? You say my show?
Like, my whole...

632
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,320
The bit about Cosby and the Jews
and the whole Filipino thing.

633
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,120
That was all fine with you.

634
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,360
What made you want to write a letter
is that I don't have a boyfriend?"

635
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,640
She went on to say,
"My brother Ray is also single."

636
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,040
Oh, well, that's why some of us
are not in relationships.

637
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:30,760
It's not because we choose it.
It's 'cause we haven't met Ray.

638
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,960
She went on to offer me a date with Ray.

639
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,120
"We'd be willing accompany Ray
on the Megabus to London."

640
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,200
So, Ray needs a chaperone.

641
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,240
And I don't know everything,
but I'm pretty sure

642
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,280
the only time somebody takes a bus
to meet someone they've seen on TV

643
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,920
is to fucking kill them.

644
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,280
So, I did not attend. But what winds me up
is that men don't get these letters.

645
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:58,920
I work with a ton of men.
Look at Leonardo DiCaprio.

646
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,400
Famously single for years.

647
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,400
Up until a few months ago,
he and I had the same number of Oscars,

648
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,920
and nobody is writing him.

649
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,960
Nobody's ever, like, "Dear Leonardo,

650
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,920
we recently saw you muff-diving
all those supermodels...

651
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,160
on Taylor Swift's yacht.

652
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
And we were so worried.

653
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,080
My brother Ray is also single."

654
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Like, no.

655
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,080
Nobody wants to fuck Ray.

656
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,240
I dated an English actor this year. Ooh!

657
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,960
Accidentally, I fell in love with him.

658
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,400
And Englishmen, you are such gents.

659
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,016
That's part of what I love
about living here.

660
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,200
You're such gentlemen.
He took me to lunch,

661
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,920
and in the middle of the meal,
out of absolutely nowhere,

662
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,480
he said, "Katherine,
you have a beautiful asshole."

663
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,240
The hole.

664
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,320
Like, not even, like, "your body."

665
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,480
They're looking at the hole.

666
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,680
I didn't even know that he had seen it.

667
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,016
I knew, of course,
that he was in the general vicinity.

668
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,320
At no point was I aware
that he got such a well-lit...

669
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,680
and detailed gaze...

670
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,040
upon my asshole. The hole.

671
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,880
Then, instead of looking away,
as you or I would, girls,

672
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,920
he focused in.

673
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,200
He admired it for long enough

674
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,160
that he was able to make a mental note
to compliment me on it afterwards.

675
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,840
Guys, I am a lady.

676
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,440
So, I said, "Thank you,"

677
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,120
hoping he had finished his poem.

678
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,560
But there was more.

679
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,920
He went on to say, "No, Katherine, really.

680
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,800
Katherine, you have
one of the top four assholes..."

681
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,560
Strange number.

682
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,080
"that I have ever seen."

683
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,120
I am trying to understand how minds work.

684
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,320
If you want to rank things, fellas,
then you do it,

685
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,960
but don't announce it, like,
"Oh, you are any one of the top four..."

686
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,280
That's not mysterious at all.
I know I'm not number one, don't I?

687
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,320
I knew I wasn't even number two,

688
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,456
or he would've been, like,
"You have one of the best two..."

689
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,000
No, top four means that my asshole...
the hole...

690
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,760
I might slip in the ranking.

691
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:54,680
Top-four... I mean, asshole
got an honorable mention from this prick.

692
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,176
And I don't know how to get on the podium.
That's not constructive criticism at all.

693
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,400
I can't even see it.

694
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,736
It just messes with you.
I've got to walk around in my life

695
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,200
not knowing which three bitches
I've got to kill.

696
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,080
This actor, he wanted to go
out of the house all the time.

697
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,320
"Let's dress sexy
and get out of the house."

698
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,360
I was, like, "I can be sexy,
if you like nights in and some opinions."

699
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,440
He did not.

700
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,360
He was, like, "I think it's time for us
to be photographed together at an event."

701
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,000
I was, like, "Why?
So I can be in one of those magazines?

702
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,840
I found out I was dead on Facebook.

703
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,840
There's room in my dog's grave for me.

704
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,160
Then just, like, a picture of me
and the <i>TOWIE</i> kids."

705
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,760
I didn't want to go.
I said, "I'm not going anywhere tonight.

706
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,840
I got a new cordless vacuum.
You know that."

707
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,576
I said, "If you want to be photographed
at an event,

708
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,040
why don't you take one of those models
that you usually date?"

709
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,080
He was, like,
"Well, Katherine, that's the thing.

710
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,320
I think it'd be very good for my image
to be photographed with a woman

711
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,640
who is not... traditionally pretty."

712
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,280
Ohh!

713
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,600
I'm his Lena Dunham.

714
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,200
What he failed to realize
is that I love and adore Lena Dunham,

715
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,816
and at Lara's age, yes,
I would've gone on the date.

716
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,360
- Would you go on the date, Lara?
- Yes.

717
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,920
Yes?! You would go out
with someone who's, like,

718
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,200
"I want to take you
because you're not so pretty"?

719
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,880
You would have gone
and, like, fucked up the date.

720
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,920
I would've definitely gone.
That's called "negging," by the way,

721
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,120
when someone undermines your confidence
just so they say one nice thing to you,

722
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,520
and you're, like, "Oh, all right.

723
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,560
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah."

724
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,760
Don't fall for that.

725
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,000
Lara, now I'm twice your age
and I'm someone's mother,

726
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,400
and you don't mess with someone's mother,
because we know whose fault you are.

727
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,160
Yeah, I called his mother. Yes, I did.

728
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,240
I was, like, "Hello, Linda. Yes, it's nice
to speak to you again as well.

729
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,400
Just want you to know I'm finished
with your son, but you're not,

730
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:10,600
because you've managed to raise one of
the top one assholes that I have ever met.

731
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,720
Click."

732
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,720
Done. Gotta do it.

733
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,320
We're not afraid of each other.

734
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,720
She's just another bitch
on the school run to me.

735
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,280
And you don't have to be a parent,
certainly not.

736
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,800
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

737
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,640
We don't suffer from
an under-population problem in this world.

738
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,480
But if you choose to have children,

739
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,840
just raise someone that other people
don't mind being around.

740
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,920
That's all you have to do.
My daughter is six.

741
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,976
Right now, I've just got to keep
her hair out of her face,

742
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,040
her hands out of her pants,
and I've nailed the day.

743
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,000
I don't beat myself up.

744
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,920
And I take Violet a lot of places.
Recently I took her to a charity event,

745
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,240
because I wanted her to see me helping...

746
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,480
No. I took her
because Prince Harry would be there,

747
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,776
and I thought I had a better shot
at meeting him with a six-year-old.

748
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
That's the truth.

749
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,176
I'll never lie to you.
That's the truth, and it worked.

750
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
This...

751
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,520
This was a wonderful charity,
a youth homeless charity.

752
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,216
They do amazing things throughout the U.K.

753
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,160
But it was a sponsors event.
You know what that means?

754
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,600
It was full of really posh people.
It was a polo match.

755
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,800
The guest list looked
like the Panama Papers.

756
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,640
It was just, like, very...

757
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,600
And in this country,
I've noticed that posh people think

758
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,800
that only other posh people
are on their level and care about them.

759
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,680
See, we don't even have class in Canada.
We genuinely don't, right?

760
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,920
We'll eat chips and gravy off the floor.
We're, like...

761
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,160
But we don't have a class system,
not like here.

762
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,456
I tell you that, and it blows your mind.

763
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,640
You're, like,
"How do you know who to be friends with?"

764
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,880
We work it out.

765
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:53,680
But they had a speaker,
a young man who had been homeless himself.

766
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,520
And posh people, like any of us,
can become homeless at any time.

767
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,456
That's fine.
Especially with the current government.

768
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:03,760
But he gave no legitimate reason
in the speech.

769
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,160
He just looked amazing, three-piece suit,
walked up to the microphone. He's, like...

770
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,400
"Hello. So, about a year ago,

771
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,160
my parents were totally
micromanaging my life.

772
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,320
So, I left, and I stayed in summer homes
and on friends' couches."

773
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,680
I was, like, "Mate, unless the couch was
outside a Tesco Metro and smelled of piss,

774
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,280
that is not homeless.

775
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,520
That's visiting."

776
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,520
He's, like, "Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

777
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:31,440
to be on a juice cleanse
when you're homeless?

778
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,480
They withheld my trust fund."

779
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,240
Like, I looked around the room,

780
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,880
just trying to find the eyes
of anyone else who hated him.

781
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,040
Nothing. They're all, like,
"Oh, sounds bad."

782
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,560
Finally, there's silence in the room,
just for a second as he took a drink,

783
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,680
and my six-year-old loudly... as they do...
goes, "Ugh! White people!"

784
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,600
I was, like, "Yes!

785
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,560
Yes."

786
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,640
I know.

787
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,520
Because that's what I teach in my home.

788
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,800
And he wasn't even white.

789
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,400
So proud to have a child who could look
beyond someone's skin color,

790
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,200
see the white inside of him...

791
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:24,560
and hate it.

792
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,000
We have too many pets, though.

793
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,136
That's something that will happen
if you're a single mum.

794
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,200
We have two dogs, two cats
and eight rabbits.

795
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,200
In London, that's too many pets.

796
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,456
I only got the dogs...
I figured they'd kill everyone else,

797
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,120
but they're all friends.
It's a nightmare.

798
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,520
It's like a Disney film,
but with shitting. That's my life.

799
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,760
This is my life. I came home from tour.
All I wanted was my bed,

800
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,640
and one of the dogs had shat
on my pillow...

801
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,480
which is never an accident.

802
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,400
And it nearly broke me.
I was, like, whimpering. Like...

803
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,840
And Violet came into the room.
She saw what happened and said,

804
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,160
"Oh, don't worry, Mummy.

805
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,760
That's just their way of saying
they hate you."

806
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,000
Yeah, I got that, thanks.

807
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,440
She's English. That's your fault.

808
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:22,296
She started talking like that.
I thought she was just mocking you,

809
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,400
and I laughed.

810
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,440
But it is permanent.

811
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,880
You have to introduce the news
that you have a child

812
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:34,480
at a very precarious time
when you're dating.

813
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,040
Not too soon, certainly not too late.

814
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,096
You've got to do it about the same time
you would announce

815
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,120
that you have a prosthetic leg.

816
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,560
You know what I mean?

817
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,976
I think there are two kinds of people:
People who are, like, "No!"

818
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,360
And people who are, like,
"I will be that hero to help you."

819
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,920
I was, like, "I didn't just get the leg.

820
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,520
I've had it for six years.

821
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,720
I can look after it without your help.

822
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,840
All it means is that it takes me longer
to get places."

823
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,600
One of the rabbits died,
and I was very, very glad about that.

824
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:20,400
Mama needs a new pair of gloves.

825
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,000
It's wrong, I know.
And I had to be the man of the house.

826
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,040
I hate to use that term, but I feel
like it's appropriate in this context.

827
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,000
My mother was very often
the man of the house.

828
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,040
My dad was around,
but my mother was the man...

829
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:39,560
I just love to say that.

830
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,960
And I'm still mothering her.
My mum's 60 years old.

831
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,080
And she was your age, Lara, at a time
when it was very difficult to be 17.

832
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,240
Everywhere she went, just:
"Whoo, baby! Whoo!"

833
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,120
Slap on the ass. That was fine.
Cosby's running around.

834
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,160
And what happens to a woman from that era?

835
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,720
When she turns about 60,
she becomes invisible.

836
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,360
That's certainly not what you are,
but I know that that's how it feels.

837
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,760
And don't get me wrong. I can't wait.
I'm gonna rob a bank. I have many plans.

838
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,000
But I know that's how it feels for Mum.

839
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,680
Because people will still compliment you
when you're a woman "of a certain age,"

840
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,120
but they do it in a weird way.

841
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,720
They'll be, like,
"Oh, you have these grown children.

842
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,200
You're a grandmother.
Well, you look fantastic...

843
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,880
for your age."

844
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,760
And Mum's, like, "For my... my...
But I wasn't supposed to age.

845
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,520
I had them when I was 13."

846
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,680
I'm, like, "Don't say that, you daft cow."

847
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,920
Because the men don't lie,
so now I've got to defend my father.

848
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,560
I'm, like, "My dad's not a pedo."
My sister's, like, "Anymore."

849
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,680
She thinks it's funny, but it's not funny.

850
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,880
It's not funny at all.

851
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,760
So, one of the rabbits died.

852
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,040
I heard a little fracas in the next room.
Like, a little...

853
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,640
I think they were just playing too hard.

854
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,040
I went in, and the dog and the rabbit
had indeed been playing.

855
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,480
And the rabbit was laying there.
There was no blood,

856
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,640
so I'm, like, "Is it dead? Is it sleeping?
Damn you, Cosby!"

857
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,800
I scooped it up.

858
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,120
Cosby's the dog's name.
He's a hilarious Chocolate Lab.

859
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,840
We got him before the accusations
came out.

860
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,480
How were we to know?

861
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:25,040
Don't name any pets after a man
on television over the age of 60.

862
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,120
It's not safe.

863
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,720
So, I present the rabbit to Violet,
because she's my master.

864
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,640
I was, like, "I don't know
what we should do about this."

865
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:41,520
She's, like, "Oh, Anthony! Anthony!"

866
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,000
I named my child after a color,
she gives bunnies human names.

867
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,400
"I know what we must do, Mummy.

868
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,720
We must take Anthony
to the veterinarian's."

869
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,960
Because I've never said no to this kid,
two minutes later we're on a bus

870
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,720
with what I'm surer and surer
is a dead rabbit.

871
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,280
Like, it's just in her arms,
just in her arms.

872
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,520
It hasn't moved at all. Its eyes are open.

873
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,400
She's so cute, and the rabbit's so cute.
Of course people want to come and meet it.

874
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,080
They're, like, "What's his name?"

875
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,920
"What <i>was </i>his name?" Like, it's dead.

876
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,840
So, I thought, "All right, Katherine,
pull yourself together.

877
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,400
She's distracted.
You've got to be the man of the house.

878
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,600
Let's minimize the trauma. Ring the vet,
let them know we're on the way.

879
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,280
They know what to expect."

880
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,880
I said, "Hi. We'll be arriving any moment
with a six-year-old

881
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,240
and her rabbit that has been attacked
by a dog,"

882
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,840
hoping the lady could fill in the blanks,
but she's caught up in admin.

883
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:45,960
She's, like, "I'm going to need to know
the rabbit's surname."

884
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,680
I'm, like, "No, you don't."

885
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,640
"I'm going to need to know
the rabbit's birthday."

886
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,080
I'm, like,
"I can tell you what day it died.

887
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,520
If you could just improvise
the rest of the tombstone,

888
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,920
we'll be there to pick it up."

889
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,880
So, we get to the veterinarian's office.
The thing is stiff by now.

890
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,520
But Violet's got so much hope and faith,

891
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,600
and she leaps off the bus,
straight in the door

892
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,000
and presents it to the vet.

893
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:19,080
"Anthony! This is my Anthony.

894
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,000
Is he going to be all right?"

895
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,960
And the vet...
I could just see it in her eyes.

896
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,480
She looks at me. She's, like,
"You bullshit excuse for a mum.

897
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,760
I've got to deal with dog AIDS
and cat cancer

898
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,160
and cutting off balls all day.

899
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,400
You couldn't tell your own flesh and blood
that this is a dead pet."

900
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,040
And with my eyes, you know,
like, woman-to-woman,

901
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,400
I was, like, "That is exactly right.

902
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,880
<i>You </i>do it."

903
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,480
Mm-hmm.

904
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,880
Thank you.

905
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:12,760
And for £85, they will.

906
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,880
Whoo! That is the fine
for being a pussy in London.

907
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,600
Totally worth it.
I was the man of the house that day.

908
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,160
Well, guys, it's nearly time to go.
You've been so incredible.

909
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,280
Yeah. But before I go,

910
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,280
I need to go to Canada
at the end of this tour

911
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,560
to speak at my little sister's wedding,

912
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,240
because women are allowed to talk
at weddings in Canada.

913
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,880
It's bananas. They don't do that here.

914
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,720
And what my family forgot
when they asked me to speak

915
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,080
is that they hate everything
that I think and say.

916
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,720
And, in fairness, I'm not a fan of theirs.

917
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,240
I just love my baby sister so much,
I miss her so much,

918
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
and I want it to be an amazing speech.

919
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,280
So, I wondered if, Apollo,
I could practice it on you,

920
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,400
because you're my friends.
Will that be okay?

921
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,000
Okay, great.

922
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:09,920
So, you'll be guests at the wedding.
That's perfect.

923
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,320
You've already had some drinks,
so look around the room,

924
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,240
try to decide who you might want
to get off with later,

925
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,840
who's hopefully not your cousin.

926
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,640
But it is Sarnia,
so it's gonna be your cousin. So, just...

927
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,760
just wear a condom.
Bury that deep. It's gonna be fine.

928
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,120
Okay. So, this side of the room,
you lovely people,

929
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,760
and at the top as well,
you'll be the bride's friends and family.

930
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,440
Is that cool? We're related.

931
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:36,160
And then this side of the room,
you'll be the groom's friends and family.

932
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,920
Mysterious.
Okay, so, I am the maid of honor,

933
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,280
and this is time for my speech.

934
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,801
Once again, guys,
I appreciate you so much for being here.

935
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,760
Okay.

936
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:51,360
Good evening, room of strangers.

937
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,400
I am so honored to have been chosen
as Kerrie's maid of honor today,

938
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,040
mostly because I know it pisses off
her whore friends...

939
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:08,480
who wouldn't know honor
if it slapped them in the face.

940
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,040
Chiefly because they'd be
getting slapped in the face

941
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,960
by eight to ten cocks at any moment.

942
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,120
Wow, ladies,
you all look absolutely normal.

943
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,520
Thank you all.
Thank you for looking after my first baby.

944
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:30,840
It has admittedly been a really long time
since I've seen my little sister Kerrie,

945
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,280
but I clearly remember the day
she was born.

946
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,360
I was six years old, Mum was thirteen.

947
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,960
Dad was on the run from the law.

948
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:47,920
I looked into the tiny incubator,
and I saw that the baby inside

949
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,040
had managed to grow both fingernails
and eyelashes from inside the womb.

950
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,800
I didn't know babies could do that.
I thought, "Yes! This is my sister."

951
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:00,440
I glanced at Joanne, who was pretending
to be an acorn at the time.

952
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,520
And I thought, "Oh, good. I never have
to talk to that one ever again."

953
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,440
From then on, Kerrie was my baby.

954
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:14,320
She had my mum, but she liked me better,
so she always called me Kathmum,

955
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,200
but it came out "Kathbum,"
so that's been my name at home ever since.

956
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,160
When my parents said no, I said yes.

957
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,240
When they announced their divorce,
Kerrie grabbed my arm

958
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:30,160
and shrieked, "But if Daddy moves away,
who will clean our swimming pool?"

959
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,240
Ugh! White people! You know?

960
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,920
Kerrie slept in my bed.
I gave her all my toys.

961
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,240
I gave her my clothes.
I drove her to school.

962
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,200
I gave her money, I gave her fake IDs.

963
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:47,080
And then, when she was just 14, I left.
I just left.

964
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,080
And she's the only one of you that I miss.

965
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:55,680
I only come back to this fuckhole
you people call a town...

966
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,040
to have an inappropriate laugh
with my sister.

967
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,280
And kind of to see how fat your arms got.

968
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,280
The following is a list of places

969
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,880
that Kerrie and I have been kicked out of
for laughing:

970
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,760
Two taxis, a school assembly, the A&E,
Papa's funeral, Nana's funeral,

971
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,880
Granddad's intervention,
Granddad's funeral...

972
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,840
Joanne's choir recital,
Joanne's piano recital,

973
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,000
Joanne's tap recital,
Joanne's ballet recital,

974
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,640
Joanne's gymnastics recital,
Joanne's wedding...

975
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:31,880
which was in a forest, by the way.

976
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,280
And you can't kick someone out
of a forest.

977
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,240
That's everyone's land.

978
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,360
And we were not wrong for laughing.

979
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,200
Kerrie and I were on either side of her,
and she had knitted her own wedding dress.

980
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,760
So it had little crocheted holes.

981
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:53,080
Well, we spotted a wasp fly
into one of the holes.

982
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,040
And Joanne loves all creatures,

983
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,120
so she was protecting it
like it wasn't happening,

984
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,080
but we knew it was stinging her
and stinging her

985
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,496
and stinging her and stinging her,
and she was in a lot of pain.

986
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,040
It was so funny.

987
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,920
Ah, but Kerrie... Kerrie has only ever
been cross with me once.

988
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,400
Just once.

989
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,160
A year ago,
Kerrie traveled with her fiancé

990
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,680
to meet his family
for the very first time

991
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,920
in the Philippines, where he is from.

992
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,200
Kerrie had a very difficult two weeks
in the Philippines.

993
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,400
She did not make
a good first impression...

994
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,040
because her face was on CNN.

995
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,120
That time really tested
Kerrie's relationship with David,

996
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,360
and her relationship with me,

997
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,160
which is why I'm especially joyful
that we're all gathered here this evening

998
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,840
and that David's entire family
have flown in from the Philippines.

999
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,720
Because to you,
it is absolutely time that I said...

1000
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:40,240
Which means, "I am sorry,
and I respect your people and culture."

1001
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,280
I mean, obviously,
I do not have time to learn Filipino.

1002
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,560
But I feel like if I just make
those noises...

1003
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,960
then they will understand that I feel bad.

1004
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,040
Look, I am a prick. Surprise!
I'm a terrible, terrible prick.

1005
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,040
But what I learned
from this horrific experience

1006
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:17,280
is that the Filipino culture
is a beautiful one

1007
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:19,840
that are all about family.

1008
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:23,720
I love David. He's my favorite man.
He treats my sister like gold.

1009
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,120
He treats me like family.
That's why they got so upset.

1010
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,600
But it also means that when Kerrie
marries David next month,

1011
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,400
I am as good as Filipino.

1012
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:36,400
Those fuckers have to accept me.
It's the perfect crime!

1013
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,920
It was also a long way around
for one sister to go

1014
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,720
to get the other one out of a jam,

1015
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,760
which is why it's such a shame I'm gonna
need her to leave him for a Jew soon.

1016
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,680
Such a shame.

1017
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:59,200
So, Kerrie, to you,
my beautiful baby sister,

1018
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,320
on your wedding day,

1019
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,160
I just want to say...

1020
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:04,960
relax.

1021
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,360
Thank you so much for listening!

1022
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,000
I'll see you soon.

1023
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,000
<i>Relax.</i>

1024
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,480
<i>Whoa. Relax.</i>

1025
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,800
<i>Oh, relax.</i>

1026
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,800
<i>Shh.</i>

1027
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,360
<i>Relax.</i>
