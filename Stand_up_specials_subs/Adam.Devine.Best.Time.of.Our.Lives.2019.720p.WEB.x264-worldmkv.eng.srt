1
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,228
Hey, man. How are you?

2
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,863
Thank you. Let's do this.

3
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,990
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,951
Adam Devine!

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,853
Hey, how's everybody doing?

6
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,524
Thank you, thank you!

7
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,318
Thank you!

8
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,071
All right.

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,656
Yeah!

10
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,576
Thank you guys so much. Take a seat.
Thank you, thank you.

11
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,912
Oh, my, you guys got me jacked.

12
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,999
I'm fully juiced for this thing.

13
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,293
Man, I am, I'm so excited to be here.

14
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,772
Thank you guys for having me.
I'm gonna have a blast tonight.

15
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,754
We all are.

16
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,592
I'm so excited to be...

17
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,303
I can't get that excited, though,
'cause I'm an adult man now.

18
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,056
You know, you can't get that excited.

19
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,557
They will lock you up.

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,853
You can't get little-kid-level,
like, geeked, you know?

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,691
Remember when you were a kid
and you would, like, open up a present,

22
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,736
and you didn't have the vocabulary
to say, like, "Thank you so much, Mama."

23
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,864
Or however you guys talked, I don't know.

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,241
I was kind of a weirdo.

25
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,660
I said things like, "Yeah, Mama.

26
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,120
Thank you so much, Mama."

27
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,509
You didn't have the vocabulary
to say that, so you just went like...

28
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,172
You cannot make that face as an adult.

29
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,259
They will lock your ass up.

30
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:19,264
You can't do, like, adult-ass things
like take your kid to school,

31
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,933
drop them off, and be like,
"Enjoy your lunch today.

32
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,605
I made it myself!

33
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,483
Ham and cheese!"

34
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,445
They will have some questions about
the quality of those meats, you know?

35
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,242
I made that, like, little-kid-level
excited face for, like, two months,

36
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,494
as a child, I swear to you.

37
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,706
My mom, uh, gave me a super bouncy ball
for my birthday.

38
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,876
You guys didn't have poor parents?
That's cool. Uh...

39
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,379
She gave me this bouncy ball, right?

40
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,102
And for like two months straight,
I was just in my driveway like...

41
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,182
Snatched it in midair.

42
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,686
That's a phrase
you only use in your youth.

43
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,270
"Midair."

44
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,482
Nothing is midair as an adult.

45
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,861
Everything as a child is like,
"I caught it midair, Mom.

46
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,655
It was soaring through the abyss,
and I snatched midair.

47
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,908
Midair, Mom, midair, midair, midair."

48
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,367
My mom's like, "Jesus Christ."

49
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,996
"Of course you caught it midair, honey.

50
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,166
Because anything

51
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,919
you catch in the air...

52
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,301
...would technically be midair.

53
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,304
'Cause if you caught it on the ground,

54
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:44,158
that'd be called picking it the fuck up,
you idiot, you dumb little boy."

55
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,892
But kids...

56
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:49,229
What's cool is that kids are still getting
that level of geeked, you know,

57
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,564
they're still getting fully geeked, right?

58
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,900
Like, I was in this elevator
not too long ago,

59
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,652
no big deal, and, uh...

60
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,862
Fuck stairs! Who's with me?

61
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,989
Stupid. Stupid.

62
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,784
So I'm in this elevator,
and I was having a crappy day,

63
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,947
'cause I'm an adult, right?

64
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,411
So I'm wearing these boots,

65
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,915
and they're the shitty, asshole,
adult fabric of suede.

66
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,288
And it was raining outside.

67
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,336
So I'm in this elevator, just defeated.

68
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,129
I'm just like, "Oh, no, not my boots!

69
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,881
Oh, my boots!" You know?

70
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,092
I wasn't verbalizing that,
I'm not an idiot.

71
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,887
I'm not in an elevator alone going,
"Boots!"

72
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:27,433
"No! Not my boots!"
But I was thinking it, right?

73
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,061
And... And so these kids come in,

74
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,521
and they're, like, 13, 14...

75
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:32,730
That's a weird age, right?

76
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,817
Can we all agree that
that is the worst age

77
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,652
in the human existence?

78
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,654
Because we're like mutants at that age.

79
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,573
You go from being, like,
"Look at this cute little kid,"

80
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,492
to having an 18-month period

81
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,887
where you're just a human Transformer,
where you're like...

82
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,540
Ping, ping, ping!

83
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,669
It's confusing, right?

84
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,421
It's weird for girls, obviously.

85
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,256
Obviously, you know?

86
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,123
But it's also weird for dudes.

87
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,968
Remember how weird, like,
eighth grade was?

88
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,178
That was a confusing time, right?

89
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,109
Remember as a guy, your voice would change

90
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,200
suddenly just overnight,
like, one day you're like...

91
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,059
"Wanna go play some kickball?"

92
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,520
And then
the very next day, you're like,

93
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,480
"Fuck kickball, motherfucker!"

94
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,150
"I'm trying to get laid.

95
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,276
Pass the Hennessy.

96
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,656
"Daddy's trying to..." You guys...

97
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,700
You guys remember middle school, right?

98
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,244
Another...

99
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:33,124
Another weird thing about being
a 13, 14-year-old, for... as a guy,

100
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,084
is like,
a lot of people don't realize this,

101
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:38,379
but if you have a 13 or 14-year-old
in your life,

102
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,090
there is a 100% chance

103
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,385
that their dick is hard 100% of the time.

104
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,137
Constantly.

105
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,681
And it's not always sexual, you know?

106
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,642
Sometimes, yeah, it is, you know.

107
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,726
But not always.

108
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,646
I remember one time, like,
a gust of wind hit me just right.

109
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,901
Just a sexy, sexy gust, just...

110
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,322
Just someone slammed a car door.

111
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:05,990
It was the month of August.

112
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,534
I remember the heat
coming off that car door. Just the...

113
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,580
Just hit the nape of my neck
just right. Just...

114
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,627
And I was like...

115
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,089
That was confusing, you know?

116
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,718
I don't know about you pervs,
but I didn't have sex at 13 or 14.

117
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,764
Or 15 or 16 or 17 or most of 18, you know?

118
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,266
I'm a late bloomer.

119
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,229
So suddenly, I just got an erection
from the wind.

120
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,731
That's a confusing moment
in a young man's life.

121
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,232
I was like...

122
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,197
"Do I want to fuck the wind?"

123
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,954
"Am I wind-sexual? What does this mean?"

124
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,037
You know?

125
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,208
"Wind-sexual," so stupid.

126
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,835
That could be, like...

127
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,398
Everything's so weird nowadays that
that could be a real thing.

128
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,673
Like if you saw on CNN, you're like,

129
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,884
"Wind-sexualism is sweeping the nation,"
you'd be like, "Yeah, makes sense."

130
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,888
How weird...
It'd be so weird and confusing

131
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,724
to be like the dad of a 16-year-old boy
right now,

132
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,561
'cause your son could legitimately
come out to you and be like,

133
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,271
"Dad, can I speak with you?"

134
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,354
And you're like,

135
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,148
"You're gay.

136
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,485
And I'm perfectly okay with that.
That's fine for me."

137
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,154
And he goes, "No. Mm."

138
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,160
"No, that's weird that you put that on me.
No, I'm not gay.

139
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,788
But I am fully wind-sexual."

140
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,073
And you would have to go, like,

141
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,837
"Yep."

142
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,798
"All right, let's get the posterboard
and markers out.

143
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,383
We gotta march about this shit."

144
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,723
"Between your sister wanting to piss
standing up

145
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,681
and you wanting to fuck the wind,
we gotta march every goddamn weekend!"

146
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,062
"I remember when I took you
to soccer practice.

147
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,397
It's okay."

148
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,192
There's a ton of kids just on a bluff

149
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,568
just trying to fuck the wind.

150
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,699
Trying to catch a good gust.

151
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,911
"It's El Niño season.
We gotta get out there!"

152
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,370
Stupid.

153
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,372
What was I talking about?

154
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,333
Weed, man, it's legal in California.

155
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,793
Oh, you guys like weed? That's cool.

156
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,147
Yeah, these girls, they're getting in
the elevator, right?

157
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,011
They're coming in the elevator.
They're 13, 14.

158
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,675
That's a weird age for girls,
'cause girls grow so quick, right?

159
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,779
That's why you always see a pack of girls,
they'll be a bunch of little girls

160
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,803
and then like one girl that's, like,
three and a half feet taller than them.

161
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,767
She's just...
You know?

162
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,603
They always look like they're, like...
grew that far

163
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,687
just that afternoon.

164
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:45,024
Like, they grew three and a half feet,
just like, "What's happening?"

165
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,692
You know?

166
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,528
That's what was happening.
She was gigantic,

167
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,251
one girl that was coming in the elevator,

168
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,406
she was, like, my size,
like, 6'2 ", 6'3", you know?

169
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,999
You can't tell how big I am.
I'm on stage, you know?

170
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,919
So she comes in the elevator
just all gigantic,

171
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,712
and her friend comes in,

172
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,173
and she has a mouth full of braces,
you know,

173
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,883
and she still looks like a little girl.

174
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,778
You can tell she's pissed
her friend's more developed,

175
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,842
so she's like,
"Get in the fucking elevator, Becky."

176
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,182
"Ooh, with your 'new boobs.'

177
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,393
Complain about
your back one more time, bitch."

178
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,396
Meanwhile, Becky's like,
"Everything hurts!"

179
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,437
You know?

180
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,649
And I'm in the elevator going,
"Not my boots!" You know?

181
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:29,652
But they were having the best time.
The one little girl's telling a story.

182
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,696
She was like, "Oh, my God!"

183
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,951
"Oh,

184
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,078
my

185
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,038
God!"

186
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,833
And her friend's losing her mind,
her friend's like...

187
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,670
And I'm like, "Oh, shit.

188
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,672
The youths are
about to teach me something.

189
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,509
This is gonna turn my whole shitty,
adult-ass day right around."

190
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,095
And she goes, "We were running...

191
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,977
We were running..."

192
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,071
And I'm like, "Yeah?
And then what happened?"

193
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,565
And she goes, "We were running."

194
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,368
I'm like, "You said that, bitch,
what's up?"

195
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,863
And she goes,
"And there was that puddle..."

196
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,422
That was it,
that was the end of her story.

197
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,456
Her friend lost her fucking mind.
Her friend was like...

198
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,169
And I'm like, "Oh, shit,

199
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,213
that right there is the difference
between being an adult

200
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,590
and being a child.

201
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,550
Because as an adult,

202
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,386
that story fucking sucked."

203
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,475
That was a dog shit story.

204
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,396
But as a child, that might have been
elite-level storytelling for that crew.

205
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,816
'Cause she wasrunning.
There was that puddle.

206
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,902
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha.

207
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,988
Quite the epic adventure.

208
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,408
I was also running.
There was also that puddle.

209
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,243
It ruined my fucking boots.

210
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,873
And it got me thinking, like, "Man.

211
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,001
It's so hard to have
that level of a good time."

212
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,004
Like you guys tomorrow
are going to go to work,

213
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,888
and your friends are like,
"How was the show?"

214
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,044
You're not gonna go like...

215
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,969
No one at home is gonna be like,

216
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:22,264
"Yeah, you know what..."
Your spouse or whoever comes in the room,

217
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,908
and it's like, "How was
his stand-up special?" And you're like...

218
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,895
It just won't happen.

219
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,814
Like, we're adults, we've seen some shit.

220
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,297
Some weird stuff'll have to go down

221
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,109
in order for us
to lose our minds like that.

222
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,588
Right? A ton of hot chicks would have
to come running in with pistols drawn,

223
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,656
like, "Freeze!" And we're all like...

224
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,201
And they go, "Just kidding.

225
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,786
We're going to suck your dicks."

226
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,746
And we're all like...

227
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,585
Stupid.

228
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,509
Seeing some women's faces over here,

229
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,302
like, "That's not
the best time of my life.

230
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,348
That actually sounds
like a fucking nightmare."

231
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,894
Admittedly, that is
a more dude-centric best time...

232
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,646
of your life.

233
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,568
That'd be pretty depressing,
if you're female, that's where you peak.

234
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,113
That's your best time of your life?

235
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,907
You're, like, on your deathbed
talking to your kid.

236
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,075
Your kid's like, "Mom,

237
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,287
like, when was the best time
of your life?"

238
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,955
You have a shitty kid. "Mom..."

239
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,837
"You're dying, I guess? I dunno.

240
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,424
Like, when was
the best time of your life?"

241
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,627
And you're all old and shit,
so you're like, "Well..."

242
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,557
Why is that,
you hit, like, 85 years old,

243
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,680
no muscle control your mouth anymore,
you're like...

244
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,269
"Sorry about this."

245
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,778
"I got... I got it.

246
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,489
Well, I was at a comedy show.

247
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,827
The little one from <i>Workaholics</i>
and <i>Pitch Perfect</i> was onstage."

248
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:16,212
"And other movies and TV shows,
but I don't want to go down the list.

249
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,674
Halfway through the little guy's set,
a ton of hot chicks came running in,

250
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,177
with pistols drawn,

251
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,888
and started blowing your dad!"

252
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,141
"Best time of my life!"

253
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,479
Your kid'll be like, "I'm pulling
the plug. That's just depressing.

254
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,107
We didn't march for that shit, Mom."

255
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,191
Stupid.

256
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,922
The best would be watching
every dude in here who's on a date

257
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,090
act like they're not having
the best time of their life.

258
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,408
Be like, "Ah! What, babe?
She's got a gun!"

259
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,497
"We must listen to the assailants.

260
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,582
Ah, no! Not the whole thing! What?"

261
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,337
"This is torture.
No, no! Anything but the balls!

262
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,590
Aah! No, don't put a finger in..."

263
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,053
Stupid.

264
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,392
That would be the conversation
on the car ride home, too.

265
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,310
It wouldn't be like, "Oh, my God.

266
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,479
We were just held up at gunpoint.

267
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,816
That was insane.
I saw my life flash before my eyes."

268
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:22,027
It wouldn't be that at all. It'd be like,
"Don't put a finger in your ass?"

269
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,698
"What the fuck, Chad?"

270
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,536
Chad would be like, "What, babe,
I saved your life."

271
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,665
"I'm a hero, babe.

272
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,167
I'd do it again. I don't care.

273
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,753
I would do it again."

274
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,882
He's walking like that
'cause of the finger, you know.

275
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,343
That's how stupid guys are, too, like,

276
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,430
if it was Victoria Secret models
that ran in here with guns,

277
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,099
every dude in here would be like,
"Let's hear 'em out."

278
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,645
"Possible blowjob situation
might unfold."

279
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,606
Not me. I'm running. I'm a bitch.

280
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,024
I know that about myself.

281
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,400
I was recently in a bar fight.

282
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,069
I was in a bar, and...

283
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,654
I'm not gonna lie to you guys.

284
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,864
We have a rapport.

285
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,866
I was in a bar, and a fight broke out.
Man...

286
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,702
I ran away so quickly.

287
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,580
Like, aerodynamically fast.

288
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,458
Like, head down, arms back, like...

289
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,877
"Gotta get away!"

290
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,976
It sucks, 'cause I get recognized,
you know?

291
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,303
I can't run away like a bitch anymore,
like the good old days.

292
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:33,724
I don't want to be a meme the next day
that just says, "Adam Devine, bitch made."

293
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,481
You can't run away from fights
like you used to.

294
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,004
Used to be able to get out of there.

295
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,586
Now everyone has a phone
connected to the internet on it. Right?

296
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,852
Next time you're at a bar
and a fight breaks out, watch,

297
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,197
there's gonna be five dudes

298
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,241
who are gonna act like they're gonna
join the fight and absolutely won't.

299
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,619
Like, a fight breaks out,
and they're like, "Oh, shit."

300
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,337
Throwing kicks and punches
from 35 feet away.

301
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,675
"I don't know how none of those landed."

302
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,261
How come people that are
about to start a fight

303
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,013
suddenly lose their sense of hearing?

304
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,140
You noticed this phenomenon?
"What'd you say?"

305
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,769
"What the fuck d'you say?

306
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,605
What'd you say? I can't hear you.
What'd you say?"

307
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,583
That'd be a good way to get
out of a fight, act like you're deaf.

308
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,530
Nobody's gonna hit the deaf guy.
You're a fucking monster.

309
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:30,990
He didn't hear you.

310
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,877
You're a piece of shit,
you hit the deaf guy.

311
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,161
You're like, "Fuck this guy!"

312
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,330
And he's like, "I couldn't hear you!

313
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,424
I got a hearing aid,
so I couldn't hear you!"

314
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,750
And you're like, "Oh, shit."

315
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,130
"Chad, Derek, let's roll."

316
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,675
"He couldn't hear our qualms."

317
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,510
If you beat up a deaf guy,

318
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,221
you definitely have two friends
in your crew named Chad and Derek.

319
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,266
'Cause those are
the two worst white guy names.

320
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,603
I hope there's a Chad and Derek in here
right now going, "What the fuck, bro?"

321
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,441
"Derek, you listening to this shit?"

322
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,359
Derek's like, "What'd you say?"

323
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,485
And I'm like...

324
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,451
How come when someone's really loud,
that's not scary or intimidating, right?

325
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,994
It's when they get quiet.

326
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,871
That's when it gets weird, right?

327
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,874
You're at a party,
somebody bumps right into you,

328
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,474
you spill a drink on yourself,
you're like, "Hey, man, fuck you."

329
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,501
And that guy goes, "No!

330
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,758
Fuck you!"

331
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,761
You're not scared. You're like,
"Oh, he's obviously a crankhead.

332
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:35,971
I just won't move."

333
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:40,517
Crankheads are like T. rexes
in that respect.

334
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,479
He'll be like, "Fuck you!"

335
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,564
And you're like...
And he's like, "...you..."

336
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,948
"Must find more crank!" You know?

337
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,077
That's the best T. rex impression
you're gonna hear tonight.

338
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,372
It's when they quiet, right?
That's when shit gets weird.

339
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,656
Like, somebody bumps you, you're like,
"Hey, fuck you." And that guy just goes...

340
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,851
"No."

341
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,855
"Fuck you."

342
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,650
You're gonna be like,
"Holy shit, grab your things.

343
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,735
This guy's gonna shank us.

344
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,154
What is wrong with this man?"

345
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,238
Stupid.

346
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,201
Let's get political, guys.
Global warming, where do we stand?

347
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,579
Yeah. Fuck the coasts, right?

348
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,165
Time for Omaha, Nebraska
to get some beachfront property.

349
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,458
Who's with me?

350
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,672
I like how you guys
all just applauded about

351
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,715
mass death to half the...

352
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,678
"Fuck it, let 'em drown." Cool, guys.

353
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,265
I can't wait to go vacation
somewhere tropical,

354
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,391
like the Arctic.

355
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,479
Just recline on my beach chair
and slightly move my Corona

356
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,607
to block the view
of a polar bear drowning.

357
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,577
Relax.

358
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,744
Stupid.

359
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,039
Man, it's so good to be here, guys.
Thanks for coming out.

360
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,252
I put a lot of thought into this special,

361
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,920
of what I'm gonna wear.

362
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,464
I went with, uh, what I wear
every day, so...

363
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:37,509
Part of me wanted to wear a cape...

364
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,971
just at the punchline
so I could do shit like...

365
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,018
I wanted to wear a cape so that, like, uh,

366
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,261
when you guys are, like...
you're here and you're like,

367
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,938
"Man, he's wearing a cape, that's funny,

368
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,702
he's definitely gonna
talk about the cape."

369
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,836
And then 20 minutes in, you're like,
"I guess he's closing on the cape stuff?"

370
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,548
Then at the end of the show
when you're driving home,

371
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,199
you're like, "Fuck that guy, I hate him.

372
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,034
He's stupid.

373
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,119
That was a fashion choice.
I hate that man."

374
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,456
I actually did use to wear a cape,

375
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,583
which is a little embarrassing,
but whatever.

376
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,252
There's 2,500 of us, let's get intimate.

377
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,465
I used to wear a cape. I was, like,
deep into magic as a kid, you know?

378
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:20,093
Yeah. You know, I was 26

379
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,470
and deep into magic.

380
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,926
I was like seven years old
and I was deep into magic.

381
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,517
I didn't know any, like,
tricks or spells or whatever.

382
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,728
I called them "ta-dahs?"
'cause I was an idiot.

383
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,313
I didn't know any ta-dahs.

384
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,733
One of my big ta-dah would just be me
putting earthworms on the sidewalk

385
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,693
and being like, "How did they get there?"

386
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:41,073
"Ta-dah!"

387
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,408
My friends are like,
"You're covered in mud.

388
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,743
Obviously you dug them up.

389
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,620
You're horrible at this.

390
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:47,954
Just wash your hands."

391
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,100
My other big ta-dah would be
I'd leap out of the hallway closet

392
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,793
and scare the shit out of my dad,

393
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,253
while wearing a cape.

394
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,004
But I did it every day.

395
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,006
So he, like, knew it was coming.

396
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,509
I'd be me at the top of the stairs
going, "Papa..."

397
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,178
I was a weird kid, remember?

398
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,681
"Papa, I've fallen
at the base of the stairs again.

399
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,143
Right next to the hallway closet.
Ah, help me."

400
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,771
And he's like, "Jesus Christ."

401
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,483
"She shouldn't have drank
when she had him."

402
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,904
"We didn't know, it was the '80s,
you know?"

403
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,251
I'm hiding in the closet,
he'd come around,

404
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,362
he's like, "Where are you?"

405
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,528
It'd just be me leaping out of the closet,
like, poof,

406
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,577
"Ta-dah!"

407
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,541
You know.

408
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,624
'Cause I was a fat kid.

409
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,963
That was a lot of exertion for me.
"Ta-dah!"

410
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,510
That was right around the time
that my dad told me that magic

411
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,179
was for the gays.

412
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,475
Yeah, kind of a bigoted thing to say,
right, guys?

413
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,021
Oh, really? You guys don't have
bigoted dads here?

414
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,736
Hmm!

415
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,821
Not buying it.

416
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,490
My dad heard me say that, he was like,
"I'm not a bigot."

417
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:06,700
I'm like,

418
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,493
"Hm. Little bit, little bit you are."

419
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,122
"Just a little bit."
He was like, "How could I be a bigot?

420
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,333
I got a black friend at work."

421
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,754
"Black Craig."

422
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:19,962
And I go...

423
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,300
"Well, that is a bigoted thing to say.

424
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,471
I'm sure Craig doesn't like to be called
'Black Craig.'"

425
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,516
"Doesn't call you 'White Dennis, '
you know?

426
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,977
Just calls you
the fucking asshole from work."

427
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,979
So I remember one time,

428
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,939
like, as an adult,
I look back at my youth,

429
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,775
and I remember my dad being bigoted,

430
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,235
but as a kid, I was like...
I didn't notice it, you know?

431
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,945
And so we're in this grocery store,

432
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,032
and we see this dude who,
as an adult I pegged

433
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,201
as a pretty flamboyant gay man, right?

434
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,829
But as a child, I'm like, "This guy
looks like he knows how to dance."

435
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,501
And my dad sees this same man,
and he's like...

436
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,853
Like, butt cheeks just clenched. Like...

437
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,146
And I'm like,
"Whatever do you mean, Papa?"

438
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,472
And he goes, "Jesus."

439
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,474
First of all, my dad is the type of dude

440
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,976
that thinks every gay man
is, like, out to fuck him.

441
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,228
You know?

442
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,732
And you guys don't know
what my dad looks like, but, uh...

443
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,068
They're not, you know?

444
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:28,865
Unless there into some very specific
kinky shit.

445
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,136
They're like, "The rougher the hands,
the better," you know?

446
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,454
Which I don't think is the case.

447
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:38,875
So my dad sees this man, he's like,
"Eee! Jesus Christ!"

448
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,754
And he goes,
"Look at this fairy over there."

449
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,298
Yeah. And I'm a seven-year-old boy.

450
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,468
Who loves magic.

451
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,766
I hear the word "fairy"
and lose my fucking mind.

452
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,091
I'm like...
"There's a fairy over there?"

453
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,230
"Where?

454
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,569
Sprinkle your pixie dust upon me, fairy.
I want to fly."

455
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,324
And my dad's like, "Don't let him
sprinkle the pixie dust!

456
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,787
Whatever you do,
don't let him sprinkle the pixie dust."

457
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,581
'Cause he thinks it's...

458
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,835
...jizz, you know?

459
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,089
Stupid.

460
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,240
This is definitely a big enough crowd

461
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,574
that there's one person in here
that read the poster wrong

462
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,892
and thought Adam Levine
from Maroon 5 was performing...

463
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,936
...stand-up comedy for the first time.

464
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,024
I know that's gonna happen on Netflix.

465
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,956
Someone's gonna be sitting at home going,

466
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,486
"What the fuck is this?"

467
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,864
"He looks horrible."

468
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:57,120
"Did he gain 40 pounds and lose 11 inches?
He is atrocious looking."

469
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,792
But I'm assuming some of you guys know
who I am from TV and movies and stuff.

470
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,005
Thank you, man.

471
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,633
It's cool, man.

472
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,302
I get recognized a lot,
which is pretty fun for the most part.

473
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,678
I get, like, free beer.

474
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,722
That's why my face is so squishy now.

475
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,600
That's one of the main things.

476
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:21,561
If I go to, like,
a Sbarro's Italian Eatery...

477
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,981
It's one of my favorite Italian eateries.

478
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,280
There's always a 16-year-old kid
working behind the counter, going like,

479
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,903
"Get the fuck out of here!"

480
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:34,282
"You can have whatever you want, bro.
I will go to prison for this shit!"

481
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,660
I'm like, "You don't need to go to prison.

482
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,996
I can... Actually, yeah, you might need
to serve some time. Give it to me."

483
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,500
Meanwhile, if I go into a Jamba Juice,
they're like, "Get the fuck out of here.

484
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,901
You broke up with Haley on <i>Modern Family.</i>
You're dead to us."

485
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,674
"Bye-bye, bitch,
no immunity boost for you."

486
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,761
But it's weird getting recognized,
'cause no one's ever cool

487
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,056
when they recognize a celebrity.
Everyone's always like...

488
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,393
"You're the guy, the guy from the thing!"
You know?

489
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,854
And I'm... I'm no better.
I ran into Will Smith at this party,

490
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,899
and I don't go to those parties
very often, but, uh,

491
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,652
I was at this party,
and I'm looking for cocktail shrimp.

492
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,737
And I'm like, "On the hunt
for the cocktail shrimp.

493
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,074
Mmm. Gotta get me some cocktail shrimp."

494
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,534
And just suddenly, it was just...

495
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,996
Just ran into the top part
of Will Smith's dick.

496
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,877
And, man, I was not cool at all.

497
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,462
In fact, I was the opposite of cool.

498
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,047
I was kind of racist 'cause I went,

499
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,507
"Morpheus!"

500
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,558
That's not who he is at all.

501
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,812
That is Laurence Fishburne,
a completely different actor,

502
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,481
but that's how, like, geeked I was,
you know?

503
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,650
He was like, "Yeah, man, okay."

504
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,612
This is an impression of anyone
when they recognize me.

505
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,055
No one's ever that cool.
Yeah, t hat's about my size. And...

506
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,951
This is... Everybody's always like,
"Shit, is that that fucking guy?

507
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,871
Is that that fucking guy right there?

508
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,623
No, no, I'll be cool, I'll check it out."

509
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,575
"It's not him, he's too fat."

510
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,546
"That is not him. That is not that man."

511
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,138
It's weird getting recognized, man, it is.

512
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:05,475
The first time it happened, it was like
the scariest moment of my life,

513
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,102
'cause I didn't expect it, you know?

514
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,937
Like, uh, first of all,

515
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,065
I didn't get recognized
right away like Blake from <i>Workaholics.</i>

516
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,109
It was episode two or three,
Blake got recognized

517
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,653
'cause he's got that amazing head of hair,
you know?

518
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,740
Yeah, yeah, Ders got recognized 'cause
he's got those bodacious man titties.

519
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:22,992
They're nice. They are nice.

520
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,994
My little troll ass, not one.

521
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:29,874
I'm driving past local high schools,
making eye contact with kids like...

522
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,796
"This ring any bells?" Nothing. Nothing.

523
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,298
So when it finally happened,
I was just like, "Yeah!"

524
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,675
I was next-level geeked.

525
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,679
and I was... It happened...
I was at a stop light, you know?

526
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,930
Which I stop at most times.

527
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,677
Sometimes I don't.
I'm like, "Fuck it, kill 'em all."

528
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:47,725
But this time I stopped.

529
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,145
And this dude comes walking past,
and he's like...

530
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,087
He wasn't walking like this,
but he was cooler for the story.

531
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,524
And he sees me and he just goes...

532
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,777
Just dead inside.

533
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,280
Just nothing happening behind the eyes,
just like...

534
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,451
Like, I thought he was sent
from the future to murder me.

535
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,037
Like, <i>Workaholics</i> had ruined
the youth of America,

536
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,332
and this is the time traveler
they've sent to end me.

537
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,513
But he wasn't a time traveler.
He was a regular person, and he goes,

538
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,628
"Adam!"

539
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:20,549
"Adam!"

540
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:24,012
And I didn't know what to do, you know,
because... that's my name,

541
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,848
and so I was excited,
and I didn't know what to do,

542
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,571
and I just did what came naturally to me,

543
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,393
and evidently what comes naturally to me

544
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,688
is the douchiest shit in the world
because I went...

545
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,318
And then...

546
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,572
Double backwards peace sign?
That is elite-level douche maneuver.

547
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:48,661
But then I literally said,
"I'm getting recognized!"

548
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,538
And then started driving a motorcycle.

549
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,248
I'm sitting in my car and I went...

550
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,066
This man looked right at me and goes,

551
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,423
"You got a tight butthole, man."

552
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,302
"Your butthole is the tightest."

553
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,764
And he walked away,
and I drove away feeling good.

554
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,390
Just ego boosted.

555
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,102
Until I realized he didn't use it
in the proper context.

556
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,386
First of all, I'm seeing some
<i>Pitch Perfect</i> fans in here

557
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,899
that are looking at me like, "Why is..."

558
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,817
Yeah.

559
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,528
"Why is he screaming about buttholes?"
Well, let me explain.

560
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,865
On my show <i>Workaholics,</i> which we did
for seven seasons on Comedy Central...

561
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,620
Thank you. Uh-oh.
Went fishing for a compliment, caught one.

562
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,206
And so on my show,

563
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,166
when something is good or cool, it is...

564
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,919
- Tight butthole.
- Tight butthole.

565
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,004
And when it's not cool or good it is...

566
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,173
- Loose butthole.
- ...loose butthole.

567
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,300
I feel like a deranged 4th grade teacher.

568
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,388
Very good, class. Four gold buttholes.

569
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,351
Chad, Derek, you got that one right.

570
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,104
"I know my buttholes."

571
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,453
Really boils down to I'm a nine-year-old
who wrote his own TV show.

572
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,900
I'm like, "Buttholes are funny."

573
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,486
"Here's the script."

574
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,114
"This is just sevens and question marks.
We cannot use this."

575
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,199
"We'll improv it. Buttholes." You know.

576
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,928
But this guy didn't say it
in the proper context, right?

577
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,954
He didn't say,
"You're being tight butthole,"

578
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,164
or "You are tight butthole."

579
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,166
He screamed...

580
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,503
in a busy intersection...

581
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,173
"You got a tight butthole, man!"

582
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,970
"Your butthole is the tightest!"

583
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,890
And I didn't do anything to negate
the fact that this man...

584
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,476
knows the actual size...

585
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,103
of my asshole.

586
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:38,855
In fact, I went...

587
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,859
"I'm getting recognized."

588
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:48,469
I wish I could meet someone who was
in that crosswalk that day

589
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,158
who had just moved to Los Angeles,

590
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,453
called their parents that night
and was like, "Holy shit."

591
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,082
"LA really is the most progressive city
in America.

592
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,503
The gays are just out here screaming
about butthole sizes."

593
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,131
Stupid.

594
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,224
<i>Pitch Perfect</i> was a weird one for me,
too, man,

595
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:13,932
I swear to you, because as we've
established, I'm a wee bit of a stoner.

596
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,392
So... Yeah, weed, cool, all right.

597
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,645
Yeah, weed? All right.

598
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:22,607
So I didn't fully read the body of
the email, I just read the subject line.

599
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,444
It said <i>"Pitch Perfect."</i> I'm like, "Cool,
baseball movie. Put me in, coach."

600
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,157
I showed up to this audition
like a true asshole.

601
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,202
I was in baseball pants
doing stretches in the parking lot,

602
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,871
practicing ground balls, just...

603
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,436
I walk in the audition...
I swear to you, I walk in the audition.

604
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,255
There's all these, like, cool-ass dudes.

605
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,174
Hollywood is, like, a weird place,

606
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,010
'cause everyone's, like,
the better-looking version of you.

607
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,512
They're looking for a type,

608
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,974
and you walk in and there's a bunch
of Taylor Lautner-looking motherfuckers.

609
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:59,194
How come cool guys look like
they had some shit thrown in their eyes?

610
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,039
You know, they were totally normal
when they walked in for the audition.

611
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,583
They're like, "Hey, what's up?
I'm here for the audition." Poof!

612
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,029
"What's up?

613
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,659
I'm here for the audition or whatever."

614
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,705
That's what was happening. There's all
these hot-ass dudes, and they're singing.

615
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,623
They're all going...

616
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:23,027
I'm like, "Good luck
singing in the baseball movie, pussy."

617
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,087
"I'll be over here stretching."

618
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,008
So I go in the audition room,

619
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,844
and I did the audition,
and it went really well,

620
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,727
and they're like,
"What song did you prepare?"

621
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,557
And at that point in my career,
all I knew about Hollywood

622
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:41,185
is that "No" holds a lot of power.
If you say no, you hold all the power.

623
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:42,549
So, "What song did you prepare?"

624
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,106
And I'm like, "I didn't prepare a song.
Take it or leave it."

625
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,819
And they go, "Leave it.
Get the fuck out of here. Go away."

626
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,696
And I go, "I prepared a song."

627
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,081
"That's one of the many pranks
I'll be playing

628
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,368
on the set of <i>Pitch Perfect,</i>
the singing movie."

629
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,914
They're like, "So what song do you know
that's just on the radio

630
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,318
so we know you can carry a tune?"

631
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,877
And I'm like, "Yes, yes, yes, a radio hit.

632
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,590
A current radio hit. Sure. Yes."

633
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,509
And then the only song
I was able to summon

634
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,429
was this one that was on the radio,
which was...

635
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,057
<i>♪ Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass ♪</i>

636
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,060
<i>♪ Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass
Ass, ass, ass ♪</i>

637
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,143
<i>♪ Bounce</i> ♪

638
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,271
<i>♪ Motherfucker hammer time ♪</i>

639
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,703
Remember that classic
from eight years ago?

640
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,444
They were like,
"Definitely not that song.<i>"</i>

641
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:34,530
"Definitely choose another song.

642
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,743
Pick a song from your youth
that you know a lot of the words to."

643
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,746
And I'm like, "Ah, shit.
What song do I pick? I don't know."

644
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:46,000
The only song that I was able to grab from
the deep, wrinkly parts of my back brain

645
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,044
was this hit, which was...

646
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,755
<i>♪ Whatever happened to predictability ♪</i>

647
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:55,259
<i>♪ The milkman, the paperboy
Evening TV ♪</i>

648
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,804
Which is the <i>Full House</i> theme song.

649
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,224
And that's evidently exactly
what they were looking for

650
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,059
in the character of Bumper.

651
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:12,860
Stupid.

652
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,071
I've been, um...

653
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,116
I've been traveling all over,

654
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,803
preparing to do this special,
so I've been doing stand-up all over.

655
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,203
I did a college a few weeks ago.

656
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,389
There's a sign language woman
on the side of the stage

657
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,458
'cause there's a deaf guy in the crowd.
I don't know what this is, but...

658
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,918
What if this is sign language?

659
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,088
What if there's one deaf guy in the crowd
going, "Say it again, motherfucker!"

660
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,509
"You talk about my mama one more time."

661
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,386
So I don't know much sign language, right?

662
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,887
But I did learn one word,

663
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,015
and in case you guys are wondering
the word "blowjob" in sign language...

664
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,602
Exactly what you think it is.

665
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,437
What?

666
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,566
I felt bad. This woman was like
my mom's age.

667
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,442
She's like a 60-year-old woman.
She's like...

668
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,620
I felt bad, man,

669
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,666
but not bad enough not to add
that word to my act 85 times.

670
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,687
Didn't even make any sense.
I was just screaming it. I was like,

671
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,129
"Blowjob! Blowjob! Blowjob!"

672
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,856
I'm like, "It's a carousel of blowjobs."

673
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:20,761
She's like, "What does that even mean?"

674
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,224
I'm like,
"Why're you tickling the balls, Carol?"

675
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,850
"That's not part of the sign.

676
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:27,894
What you doing after this, Carol?

677
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:28,811
What's good, girl?"

678
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,648
This is a good-looking crowd, guys.

679
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:35,234
Not all of you. Not all of you.

680
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,694
There's some uggos out there.

681
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,697
All right, man, some days I look so ugly.

682
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,451
Ever wake up and you're just like, "Did I
drink acid last night? What happened?"

683
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,494
And I've got a squishy, gummy face.

684
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,455
I'm gonna look hideous when I'm older.

685
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,374
Like, I'm gonna look
like a human Saint Bernard. Just like...

686
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,377
Just the droopy of skin.

687
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,672
So, like, I was having one of those days
a few weeks ago,

688
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,026
and I walked past this window
to get food with my friends,

689
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,862
and I catch my reflection in this window,
and I look at myself and I go,

690
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,429
"You know what? You look like garbage.

691
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:05,473
Time to give yourself a little ego boost."

692
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,267
So I looked at myself and go, "I would

693
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,311
fuck that dude!"

694
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,940
And I walked away feeling good,
ego boosted, until I realized,

695
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,608
I felt good about that exchange.

696
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,611
The guy working at that Wells Fargo...

697
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,740
...felt pretty weird about that.

698
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:27,161
This little troll motherfucker from
<i>Pitch Perfect </i>waddles up to his window.

699
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,455
"I would fuck that dude!"

700
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,999
I hope it boosted <i>his </i>ego.

701
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,209
I hope he's like, "Yeah.

702
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,294
You hear that, Sharon?

703
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,339
He would fuck this dude.

704
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,050
I know, I know. Not at work.
Time's up, I get it."

705
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,887
I have a girlfriend now.
That's a big thing in my life, guys.

706
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,722
Yeah.

707
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,349
Yeah.

708
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,601
It's been four years, but, you know.

709
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,187
I'm admitting it publicly now!

710
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,235
Man, I hope we don't break up.

711
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,279
Yeah.

712
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,365
Like, guys have a hard time
admitting that shit publicly.

713
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,568
Girls will do it right away.

714
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,160
You'll be on like the third date
and they're like, "This my man.

715
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,830
Back away, bitch, get the fuck away,
bitch. This is my man."

716
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,917
Guys'll be like a year and a half in
and be like, "Oh, yeah. I know her."

717
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,796
"Yeah, no. Yes. I've seen her around.

718
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,339
She's got that hair, right? Yeah."

719
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,424
Yeah.

720
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,593
Then your friend calls you out.
"Aren't you living with her?"

721
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,348
And you're like, "That's where
I've seen her around. Yeah.

722
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,266
That's right.

723
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,727
The living room area. Correct.

724
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,271
She does have that hair, though.
That is true."

725
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,650
I... I... I will never break up
with her, ever.

726
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,652
Not that we won't break up.

727
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,576
I'm assuming she'll break up with me,
you know.

728
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,947
And that's what I want.

729
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,783
I will never break up with a girl again,
ever, never, never, ever.

730
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:50,661
because if you've dated a girl
for more than six months,

731
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,165
all she's doing is collecting
horrific data on you,

732
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,375
to crush you,

733
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,712
just decimate you
if you ever break her heart.

734
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,424
I broke up with this girl once
and I had to be cold with it, you know?

735
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,510
I was like, "Hey, this is going nowhere.
Just be cold, be strong, Adam."

736
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,095
So I'm like, "Hey, you know what?

737
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,471
We're done.

738
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,933
I'm sorry, but it has to end now.
I think we should see other people."

739
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,602
And without missing a beat,

740
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,354
without missing one second, she goes,

741
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,077
"You're getting fat, you're going bald,
and your dick is whatever."

742
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,985
Yeah!

743
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,906
Those are the three things I care about
in my life.

744
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,577
Going bald, getting fat,
and my dick being whatever?

745
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:33,496
Whatever dick?

746
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,416
So I looked right at her and go,
"I am not..."

747
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,299
"...going bald."

748
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,184
Those other things are debatable.
I'll admit that.

749
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,771
I had a girlfriend cheat on me once.
Anybody have that?

750
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,690
Yeah, 2,000 people here, no one? Cool.

751
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,629
You guys are like, "It might be your
whatever dick. Think about that, maybe?

752
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,253
Maybe that had something to do with it?"

753
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:10,658
I cried in front of her. Oh, that is
the most emasculating thing you could do.

754
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,493
I... Why are you laughing?

755
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,372
Some mean bitch back there, like...

756
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,125
"We've caught another!"

757
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,418
I cried in front of her.

758
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,921
That's the most emasculating thing
you can have happen to you.

759
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:27,174
I didn't allow her to see it, though,
using the power of gravity.

760
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,898
She was like, "I slept with someone else."
I'm like, "What's that?"

761
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,562
"What do you mean,
you slept with someone else?

762
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,060
Explain yourself."

763
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,731
Just trying to wiggle the tears
back in my tear ducts.

764
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:49,196
How I found out is I walked into the room,
and she was crying.

765
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,365
That's a bitch move.

766
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,077
You don't get to fuck someone else
<i>and</i> keep all the boo-hoos.

767
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,248
All boo-hoos are mine in this scenario.

768
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,625
I walk in the room, she's like...
"Mm-mm-mm...

769
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,170
Mm-mm, no.

770
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,298
Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

771
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,381
No."

772
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,969
You don't know her, but this is
a really good impression that I'm doing.

773
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,556
"No. Mm-mm. Mm-mm."

774
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,199
I'm like, "What happened?
Did one of the <i>Pretty Little Liars</i> die?

775
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,310
You love that show.

776
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,769
And she's like...

777
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:22,980
"Fine, fuck it."

778
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:27,067
"I slept with Kevin."

779
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,326
And I'm an idiot, so I'm like,
"What do you mean, you slept with Kevin?

780
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,866
You slept near him
when you guys went on that trip...

781
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,075
business trip together?"

782
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,679
And she's like, "No, you fucking idiot,
I fucked Kevin."

783
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:39,705
And I'm like, "Aah!" 'Cause I know Kevin.

784
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,332
Kevin's nickname?

785
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,209
Sweaty Kevin.

786
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:46,837
That's not the guy you want
to fuck your girl.

787
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,465
You don't want a guy with a nickname
that starts with "Sweaty."

788
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,219
You don't want Sweaty Kevin fucking her,
you want Handsome Chris.

789
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,846
Hemsworth.

790
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,619
If she fucked Chris Hemsworth,
I would've proposed right then.

791
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,644
"This shit's real. Okay."

792
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,316
I would've told everyone
for the rest of my life.

793
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,359
I'd be like, "She fucked Chris Hemsworth.

794
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,695
Now she's fucking me!"

795
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,065
I would've told our kids. I would've been
like, "Your mom fucked Chris Hemsworth.

796
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,121
Now she's fucking me!"

797
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,083
And our kids would be like, "We know, Dad.

798
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,585
We're 6'4 " and blond."

799
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,057
"You're delusional,
mate. We're Australian. What the fuck?"

800
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:41,808
Stupid.

801
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:43,803
I'm glad I have a girlfriend,

802
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:46,397
mostly 'cause I can watch Netflix
with someone,

803
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,984
and not catch an STD. That's it.

804
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,945
Right? Like, being able to watch
<i>Ozark</i> with someone

805
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,321
and not have an itchy crotch.

806
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,531
That's the one-two punch

807
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,449
of being in a relationship.

808
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:00,077
STDs are terrifying, right?

809
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,079
You guys disagree? That's cool.

810
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,162
You guys are like,
"There's some good ointments now,

811
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,750
you can take care of most things."

812
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,670
STDs are scary, right?

813
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:12,047
Not so much the S and the T, really.

814
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,679
Mostly the D.
That's the scary shit, right?

815
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,514
Disease. Uh-uh.

816
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,766
"Sexually transmitted" just sounds like

817
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,311
some cool electronic band from Germany

818
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:29,106
playing on the third stage of Coachella
at 5:00 a.m.,

819
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,749
- with some weird bangs, who's like...
- "Hello...

820
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,321
Ve are Sexually Transmitted."

821
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,573
<i>"Ja!</i>

822
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,742
Super.

823
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,496
<i>Nein, nein, nein, nein,
nein, nein, nein, nein!"</i>

824
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,249
You're like, "These guys are good.
They're from Germany!"

825
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,669
"Can't wait for song number ten!"

826
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,090
Disease, that's the scary shit, right?

827
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,426
I think the best STD to have...

828
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,595
Um...

829
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,809
...would be the one I have.
Know what I'm saying?

830
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,726
No, Adam, ew. Ew! No.

831
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,188
I think the best STD to have,
hear me out, would be crabs...

832
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,776
'Cause they sound delicious, right?

833
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,031
"I've got crabs." Well, I have butter.
Let's have a feast!

834
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,496
Wait, that's pubic lice? Never mind.

835
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,539
I'll leave the butter at home.

836
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,252
You know what? I'm bringing the butter.
Let's party tonight. Why not?

837
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,336
Stupid.

838
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,091
Why is it whenever you're at a party,

839
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:41,553
whoever says they're cool to drive is
always the least coolest person to drive?

840
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:43,639
Without fail.

841
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,483
Like, if you drove somewhere,
you should be able to drive home, right?

842
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:49,144
It's like saying, like,
"I can tie my shoes."

843
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,644
If you come in a room and say,
"I can tie my shoes,"

844
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,359
everyone's like,
"Get this motherfucker some Velcro.

845
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:00,906
He cannot handle the bunny ear situation
on his tippy-toes." You know?

846
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,145
It's always that person that passed out
early at the party.

847
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:08,288
If you took a nap at the party,
you're not driving anywhere.

848
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,791
There's no naps allowed at the party.

849
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,335
It's always on that decorative pillow
your grandma gave you,

850
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:15,337
with, like, the zippers and buttons.

851
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,741
So when he wakes up, he looks like he got
in a fucking knife fight in the 4th grade.

852
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:19,967
He's like...

853
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,211
Comes in the room, you're like...
"Where're you going?"

854
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,264
"Where you going?"

855
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,366
Does that thing every drunk person does

856
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,661
when they open their eyes way too wide
to seem not drunk,

857
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,187
but then they look like a serial killer.
Where they're like...

858
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:36,983
"Where you going?

859
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,696
I'm cool to drive."

860
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,365
You're like, "No, you're not, Chad."

861
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:48,454
"I just saw you shadow boxing
in the corner for 20 minutes.

862
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,790
You just pissed in my laundry basket."

863
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,334
Keep saying things
that don't make any sense.

864
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,794
"The bitch took my Skittles.

865
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,381
The sour ones! I love the sour ones!"

866
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,258
And you're like,
"I won't let you drive, man.

867
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,021
I'm a good friend.
I won't do that to you."

868
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,345
And then he's like,
"But we're going to Taco Bell."

869
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,598
And you're like, "Let's go!"

870
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,186
Why is that?

871
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,355
Why is that, like, the only food
in American society

872
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,065
that we're willing to die for?

873
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:20,194
There's no other food.

874
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,030
If it's 3:00 a.m. and everyone's wasted,
and your friend's like,

875
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,324
"Let's go get some chicken parm!"

876
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:27,493
You're like, "Shut the fuck up, Larry."

877
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,956
"I'm not gonna go eat chicken parmesan
right now, you monster.

878
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:36,460
No chicken parm right now, we're wasted."

879
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,379
But if he's like, "Beef and Bean Chalupa!"

880
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,090
You're like, "Slit my wrist right now.
I will die for this shit.

881
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,470
Cheesy Gordita Crunch? Give me the noose!"

882
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,477
I enjoy a party, guys,
as you can tell by my extra neck fat.

883
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:55,604
I do, man.

884
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,898
It was just my birthday
a few days ago, guys.

885
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,068
Yeah.

886
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:04,363
Yeah, I just turned 35 years old.

887
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,740
Yeah, okay.

888
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,117
Give it up for your mid-thirties, I guess.

889
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,954
It's a shitty age. 'Cause I still party,

890
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:14,724
but I'm friends with my friends
from high school, who have real jobs.

891
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,042
They have kids and mortgages
and real lives,

892
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:20,003
and I'm like, "Hey, what are we doing
for my birthday?"

893
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,757
And they're like, "Your mid-week
35th-year-old birthday?

894
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,887
Absolutely nothing,
you Peter Pan motherfucker.

895
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,725
We're not doing anything
for your birthday.

896
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,395
It's Dalton's soccer practice...

897
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,147
the next morning."

898
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,152
I'm happy too, man, because my friends
used to try to murder me on my birthdays.

899
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,333
Twenty-one was
the scariest day of my life.

900
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,867
I feel like girls are nicer their friends
on their birthdays.

901
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,327
They're like, "Fuck it, bitch,
let's do you, spa day, ah!"

902
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,747
Not guys. Guys are like,
"Are you ready to die tonight?

903
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:01,920
You better call Mom and Dad, 'cause we're
taking you straight to Hell." You know?

904
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,746
My friends tried to murder me.

905
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:06,466
They're like, "21 shots, 21 minutes.
Let's do this."

906
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,304
I'm like, "Oh, that sounds dangerous."

907
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,222
"But okay."

908
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,703
It's always the grossest shots
you ever want to take.

909
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,287
It's never anything you enjoy drinking.

910
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,392
So it's like,
"Dude, it's Cum in a Bathtub. Take it."

911
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,275
"It's a Gorilla Ass Fart.

912
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:25,569
Take it, take it."

913
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:27,946
"This is just homeless piss
in Tabasco sauce.

914
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,866
We call it the Spicy Leon.

915
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,452
Take it, take it."

916
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,453
Half hour later,

917
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:37,016
I was curled in the fetal position,
asking God for forgiveness.

918
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,125
That's when my friends decided
to get me laid, too,

919
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,808
which sounds like a good idea in theory.

920
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:45,589
But my friends, I feel like most guys'
friends, secretly fucking hate me.

921
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:49,134
So they got the biggest monster-truck,
behemoth-Clydesdale

922
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,469
mountain lady they could find,

923
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,512
one with a mole with hair coming out of it
that follows you around the room

924
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,308
like Jesus' eye in the painting
in the spare room at Grandma's house,

925
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,810
so you can't masturbate
'cause Jesus is staring at you.

926
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,646
Know that painting?

927
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,190
She put it up on purpose.
She's like, "Not in my house."

928
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,527
Like, "Finally, some alone time,"
and Jesus is like...

929
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:10,822
They bring her to me.

930
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,700
They're like, "Hey, Adam, this is Denise.

931
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,454
But we like to call her...
...Diesel.

932
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,959
She plays linebacker for the Rams. Enjoy."

933
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,877
And I did.

934
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,193
My friends are stupid, too. My friends
always ask me dumb questions.

935
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,594
My one buddy comes up to me
and he's like, "Bro, bro.

936
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,513
Seriously, would you

937
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,015
suck a dick for a million dollars?"

938
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,434
And I'm like, "Hmm...

939
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,686
Why, do you know someone?"

940
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,272
A million dollars?

941
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,816
That's such an insane question.

942
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,361
First of all, 80% of everyone in here
would be driving a Maserati the next day.

943
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,454
Like, "What, this? No, there's a deal
at the dealership. Check it out."

944
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,246
I mean, what a dumb question to ask.

945
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,808
It's not like there's some gay,
eccentric billionaire out there

946
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,000
with a cauldron of money.

947
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:06,670
Just some creepy billionaire with just
this cauldron who's like, "Suck my dick!

948
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:11,299
Suck my dick. Gather around boys,
and tinier boys...

949
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,136
to suck my dick."

950
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,680
There's a line a mile long
of straight dudes, like, "Fuck it."

951
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,267
"Gotta pay off the student loans,"
you know?

952
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,896
Chad's definitely calling Derek, like,
"You hear about this shit?"

953
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,982
"What'd you say?"

954
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,133
And he's like, "The blowjob thing."

955
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,032
And he's like, "I'm wind-sexual.
I'm off that."

956
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:33,988
Stupid.

957
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,199
I want to be rich. I'm a little rich.

958
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,326
Thank you guys for coming.
Thank you for watching.

959
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,748
I'm not like super rich, though.
I wanna be super rich.

960
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,231
I'm the type of rich that I can,
like walk into a Chipotle...

961
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,587
like, any burrito shop
and then order extra chicken.

962
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,875
And then when they say,
"That'll be two more dollars,"

963
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,009
I'm like, "I don't give a fuck!"

964
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,477
I'm like, "Extra chicken for everyone
in this bitch!"

965
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,854
And they're like, "That'll be $64."

966
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,232
I'm like, "Extra chicken just for me!"

967
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,068
That's my level.

968
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,880
I was actually able to do something cool
with my money recently.

969
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,658
When I was 18 years old, I wrote
my parents a check for a million dollars,

970
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,078
and then in the memo I wrote,
"Cash it when you can."

971
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:25,957
Then this past Christmas I was actually
able to go home and take that check

972
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,168
and fucking destroy it, you know?

973
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,091
'Cause now I'm greedy.
I got a little taste.

974
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:38,011
'Cause I want to be, like, really rich.

975
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,865
I want to be the type of rich
I can have, like, real fun with my money.

976
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,975
Right? Like to be able to go
into a police station, say, "Hey, cops,"

977
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,769
take a shit on the floor, then leave.

978
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:48,862
Just dropping wads of hundreds
on the way out.

979
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,691
They're like, "I would arrest him,
but this is too lucrative.

980
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,152
I got bills to pay."

981
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,031
I wanna be so rich that I can, like,
line my pockets with jewels,

982
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,283
diamonds, rubies, emeralds alike.

983
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,454
When a homeless person asks me for change,
I say, "How about I change...

984
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,164
your life!"

985
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,376
Stupid.

986
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,922
You guys are good laughers.
I appreciate it.

987
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,257
Thank you for laughing.

988
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,884
I'm always fearful that
there's one prankster in the crowd,

989
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,321
that when you guys were coming in,
went up to everyone like,

990
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:22,305
"Hey, let's just not laugh
the whole time."

991
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,100
"Let's fuck with him, right?"

992
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,172
You're good laughers. Thank you.

993
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:31,398
I hate when people, uh, like,
laugh when they don't mean it,

994
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:32,566
'cause we can always tell.

995
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,930
Like, they think I need a little help,
and they're like...

996
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,611
"Mm-mm. Not for me.

997
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,031
This butthole stuff's disgusting. Mm-mm.

998
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,117
Not for me. Not for me."

999
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:45,245
Laugh if you think it's funny.
Don't if you don't. That's how it works.

1000
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,099
My least favorite thing is when a person
finds it funny, doesn't laugh,

1001
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:50,292
comments on the laughter.
They say something like,

1002
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,418
"That's funny."

1003
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,048
"That is funny."

1004
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:00,051
Really? Then laugh, you piece of shit.

1005
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,890
Laughter's an uncontrollable thing,
like screaming from pain.

1006
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,268
You don't get in a car accident, come out
missing your arm and be like...

1007
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,479
"Shucks, this hurts."

1008
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,525
"Shenanigans, I'm gonna have
to get this checked out."

1009
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,904
No, they're like,
"Aah! My fucking arm is missing!

1010
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,324
I'm missing my fucking arm!"
Blood, blood, tears, angst.

1011
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,546
This is what angst looks like, by the way.

1012
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,202
Spirit fingers.

1013
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,705
Cheerleaders are always in angst.

1014
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,791
"The car wash didn't make any money."

1015
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,212
"Billy didn't talk to me.

1016
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,778
I'm not gonna eat today."

1017
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,344
Hurkey!

1018
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,639
If you had no arms,
would you wave like this?

1019
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,722
"I'm over here.

1020
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,683
Come this direction.

1021
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,517
Come this way.

1022
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,229
Chad! Derek!"

1023
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,610
I want to stop doing that joke.

1024
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,130
"If you had no arms,
would you wave like this?" 'cause it's...

1025
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,322
you know, it's really stupid,

1026
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,658
but I can't 'cause I did a while ago
at this theater,

1027
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,493
Madison Square Garden, heard of it?

1028
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:10,108
No, it was a Chinese restaurant,
but a nice one, you know?

1029
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,915
And it was like this, where, like,

1030
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,669
it was a theater, and I couldn't see
the people in the background, you know,

1031
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,512
and at the punchline,
where you guys laughed,

1032
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:20,507
'cause we're having the best time
of our lives tonight, right, guys?

1033
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,634
Hit it, girls.

1034
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,598
No, not you guys.

1035
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,559
I hired some women with guns
to come in and blow everybody, but...

1036
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:36,648
Hard to find good help here evidently,
but...

1037
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,150
At the punchline where you guys laughed,

1038
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,485
nobody laughed,

1039
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,488
and instead of laughing,
one person goes...

1040
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,128
Took a breath...

1041
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,466
...ooo!

1042
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,261
You know how much hate that is
to go back for a second "Oo"?

1043
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,763
That is just unbridled hate,

1044
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:12,183
you know, have you ever second-booed
your entire life? Never.

1045
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,395
So, you know, as a veteran comedian
I was like...

1046
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:18,536
I ignored him, you know, 'cause I'm tiny.

1047
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,527
And I get out to the lobby area
afterwards, probably...

1048
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,572
signing titties or whatever, and, uh...

1049
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,784
No, no.

1050
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,288
Keep your titties in. You took too long.

1051
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,042
I get out to the lobby area
and there's this dude there...

1052
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,961
No arms.

1053
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,713
Right? How do you think I felt?

1054
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,882
It was goose-egg on the arm front.

1055
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,135
And he comes up to me like, "Hey, man."

1056
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,803
Actually, he was like, "Hey, man."

1057
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,240
"I was really offended by what you said
up there." And I'm like...

1058
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,689
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

1059
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,401
But now that I've got you here...

1060
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,279
how <i>do </i>you wave?"

1061
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,327
I don't know how he waved. That guy
punched with his feet, I'll say that.

1062
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:14,996
I know a good way to get out of a fight.
You guys can use this.

1063
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,999
Next time you're about to get in a fight,
just be a little masochistic

1064
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,543
and a little erotic,
and you'll pull it off.

1065
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,296
You gotta be able to take one punch, okay?
So you take the punch.

1066
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,798
And then you go...

1067
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,271
Mm. Hit me again, big daddy.

1068
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,109
Oh, that hurts so good.

1069
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,986
Hit me in my no-no zones.

1070
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,030
That dude'll be like...

1071
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,911
"Chad, Derek, get out of here."

1072
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,915
"I'm gonna fuck this dude."

1073
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,596
That's it from me. Thank you guys so much.

1074
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:02,961
You guys have been amazing.

1075
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,092
Thank you, guys.

1076
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,764
Cape me up, baby!

1077
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,203
This is so stupid. Thank you guys so much!

1078
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,456
You guys really have been amazing!

1079
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,207
I love this place with all my heart!

1080
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,711
I love all you guys for coming out.
Thank you. I love you. Goodnight!
