two things for a fact:

00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,335
They know they weather is better
than yours...

57
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,380
and they know
they uniforms look better than yours.

and water.

The river go the wrong way, it--

If you not from here, you not--

You gotta be specific
when you talk to your Uber driver.

"I'm by the bridge."

the yellow bridge,

that go up and down?"

71
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,190
They don't tell you that
till you're high on the balcony.

72
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,192
"I think I saw the bridge move."

73
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,949
Beautiful shit.
The military's in the house.

74
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:46,995
Where the military at?
Make some noise for the military. Yeah.

75
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,709
In the right parts of Jacksonville,
you could feel safe.

76
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,629
But they need to tell people
that ain't from here

77
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:02,051
that there might be military helicopters
flying past your balcony,

78
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,555
or it will fuck up
your whole blunt experience.

79
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,977
I'm not speaking from knowledge.
I'm just saying if you was...

80
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:15,148
standing out there with a blunt
and see two military helicopters,

81
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:18,860
that's the first time you swallow
your whole blunt, lit and all. You:

[grunting]

83
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,824
Nigga, that was the real military.
Where the fuck is we at?

84
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,706
In Jacksonville, you'll see shit
you don't see nowhere else.

85
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:36,502
Generally, you'd just go somewhere
and look on the map and pick places out.

86
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,296
Not-- Mm-mm.

87
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,176
You need a tour guide in Jacksonville
from Jacksonville

88
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,929
to tell you where you can and cannot go.

89
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,476
You don't just wanna be driving around,
looking around.

90
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,730
You'll see some shit that'll scare you
as a nigga.

See how the audience laughed at that?

97
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,214
Most motherfucking cities got one 'hood.

98
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,969
The whole map is free.
They tell you don't go here.

99
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,432
Not in Jacksonville.

100
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,354
They got spots all around the map
you should look out for.

101
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,068
All the 'hoods sound like...

102
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,404
dangerous sitcoms.

103
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,411
"Tonight, on another episode
of Washington Heights."

104
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,584
Something going down
on Washington Heights, I'm sure of that.

105
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,754
If I know any of the 'hoods in America,
I know.

108

[audience laughing]

Eureka means "Surprise!
Maybe you shouldn't be here."

112
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,698
If you looking for gardens...

113
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,286
Jacksonville do it big.

114
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,080
It ain't just 'hoods,
they got certain streets.

115
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,791
If you even type it in your phone...

116
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,254
your phone will not let you make it there.

117
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,467

Just beautiful shit.

123
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,990
Shit you only gonna have in Jacksonville.

124
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,743
Jacksonville is
the biggest city out there.

125
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:18,498
Every ten blocks is
another motherfucking neighborhood.

126
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,795
If you comfortable, don't be comfortable
too long. Enjoy yourself.

127
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,090
Most places,
when you go to the gas station,

128
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,427
the only thing you gotta look at
is the price of the gas.

129
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,513
Not in Jacksonville.

130
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,850
You gotta look at some other shit
than the price of gas.

131
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,729
You have to look at all the surroundings
of the gas station.

132
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,609
You ever decided you didn't need gas
as bad as you thought you did?

133
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,027
[audience laughing]

134
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,239
You ever gotten back in your car
to not get the gas?

135
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,659
"Oh, I don't need this gas. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

136
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:01,165
I can make it almost home
if I keep on going.

137
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,543
I'll get a little closer to somewhere--"

138
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,963
There's 32 motherfuckers out there.

139
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,174
They selling pit-bull puppies
and frying fish.

140
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,594
Mm-mm. I'm not gonna do all that
for some gas, I'm not.

141
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,556
Love Jacksonville.

142
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,934
Jacksonville, they got shit at all ends.

143
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:22,562
If you wanna shop,
they got great shopping.

144
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,566
They got great shopping,
and then they got 'hood shopping.

145
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,067
[audience laughing]

146
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,528
If you looking for the great shopping,

147
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,031
you listen
for the white-sounding official name.

148
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,201
"Town center."

149
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,953
[audience cheering]

150
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,124
That sounds official. "Town center."

151
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:48,504
We built this mall,
then we built the rest of the town.

152
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,217
The black mall sound like a club.

153
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,095
"Going down to The Regency."

154
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,309
They got two-for-one drinks
at The Regency. Who don't wanna go there?

155
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,853
Free before 11.

156
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,610
One thing I like about Jacksonville is,
no matter where you eat,

157
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,404
all the food is good than a motherfucker.

158
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:17,158
Y'all know how to eat in Jacksonville,
everything.

159
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,910
We had 12 things, everything was good.

160
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:24,165
Go to Jacksonville Beach, they got
white people making Caribbean food.

161
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,920
"Y'all ain't got no Jamaicans back there?
Who the fuck is jerking this chicken?"

162
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,507
Let me find out a white woman
is jerking this chicken like that.

163
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,473
Most places you go, if you hear
a crazy name, you can't eat there.

164
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:45,269
But here in motherfucking Jacksonville,
if they tell you it's good, it's good.

165
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,480
That motherfucking Soul Food Bistro.

166
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,023
[audience cheering]

167
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:55,154
I don't even know if them niggas know
what "bistro" means, but it's good.

168
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,534
Food so good, you be looking for a slave
in the back like, "Who is making--?

169
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,079
Show me somebody
look like a slave back there.

170
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,790
Who is putting they foot
in this corn bread?"

171
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,170
The real reason we love coming here
is because when we come here

172
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,507
we get a real taste
of what the fuck America is.

173
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,552
We get everybody in the same building
at the same time

174
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:24,433
at the same place in Jacksonville
at the beautiful Florida Theatre.

175
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:29,063
Y'all won't believe who we got here.
Where's all the Hispanic people?

176
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,982
Make some noise.
Hispanic people, is y'all in here?

177
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,360
-[speaks in Spanish]
-[audience cheering]

178
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,028
Thank y'all for hanging out.

179
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,116
Where's the Filipinos in the building?
Make some noise. Filipinos?

180
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,576
Thank all 80 y'all for spreading around.

181
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,537
Y'all didn't even sit together.

182
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,081
That was good as Filipinos,
y'all spread out.

183
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,460
Where's all the white people?
Make some noise, white people.

184
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,587
[audience cheering]

185
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,965
Look at white people sounding strong.

186
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,967
[woman screams]

187
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,303
Y'all still hanging with minorities
in this administration.

188
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,347
We appreciate that, white people.

189
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:07,184
We know some of y'all had to sneak here
on the Mayport Ferry.

190
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,607
Black people, is y'all in the building?
Make some noise.

191
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,200
We can all feel safe tonight.

192
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,827
[audience laughing]

193
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,998
It's beautiful. Beautiful.
We got young people in the house.

194
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,626
Where's everybody 25 and under?
Young people, where y'all at?

195
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,797
Thank y'all so much for coming,
we appreciate that, young people.

196
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,593
Where's all the rest of us?
Where's 25 and older? Make some noise.

197
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,224
Okay, y'all grown in the motherfucker.
I get it, y'all grown.

198
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,686
If we could tell young people anything,
we'd tell you:

199
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,733
enjoy your motherfucking youth
while you got it.

200
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,278
Whatever the fuck you're trying to do
in your dreams and shit,

201
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,448
do it right the fuck now...

202
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,118
while your body is still with you.

203
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,999
'Cause the rest of us will tell you
this getting-old shit is for the birds.

204
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:18,005
That shit do not let off.
Once it's on your ass, that's it.

205
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,133
Your ass fitting to get old right now.

206
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,764
It's fucked up. Fucked up.
We didn't know it was gonna be like this.

207
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:31,393
I used to laugh at my grandfather making
all that noise getting out the bed. He:

208
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,771
[grunting]

209
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,526
I'm there judging this shit.
"Look at this lazy-ass nigga.

210
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:42,905
He know there ain't nothing wrong with him
at 6:30 in the goddamn morning."

211
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:48,953
Now we're getting older, we see.
This shit is for the birds.

212
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,332
Your mind is still young,
but your body has checked the fuck out.

213
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,712
Ever told yourself to get out of bed
and yourself didn't listen?

214
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:02,508
You was like,
"It's time to get out of bed now.

215
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,427
[audience laughing]

216
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,681
I'm gonna get out of bed now.

217
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,520
I'm gonna lay here ten more minutes
and get my shit together."

218
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:19,567
Your body has given the fuck up.

219
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,071
You start getting older,
you gotta change shit.

220
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,074
I used to be able to watch TV
all night long.

221
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,120
Not no more.
Now I gotta take my stupid ass to sleep.

222
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:37,167
'Cause these motherfucking commercials
is too scary and too not specific.

223
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:40,921
You scared and don't even know
what the fuck you scared of.

224
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,425
I'm not the only person here
who think he might maybe

225
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,595
could possibly have mesothelioma.

226
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,179
[audience laughing]

227
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:56,270
Don't none of us know what the fuck it is.
They just keep scaring us with it.

228
00:14:56,353 --> 00:15:00,274
"You might have it. You might have it.
It's worth some money."

229
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,653
Every time I cough,
I think I done caught it. [coughing]

230
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,282
Now, I've fucked around
and caught mesothelioma.

231
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,036
I drank that miso soup that one time.

232
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,914
I think that's where it come from,
I'm not sure.

233
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,083
It's fucked up.

234
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,421
You start getting old, and shit change.
You gotta deal with it.

235
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,843
When you young, the only way you can
hurt yourself is if you in an accident.

236
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,848
You start getting older,
you can fuck yourself up

237
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,018
not doing a goddamn thing.

238
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,440
You young, you had to hurt yourself
to be in an accident.

239
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:48,656
You get older, you see your friend,
he got a cast on all his ribs and shit.

240
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,408
"Goddamn, nigga,
did you get in a car accident?"

241
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:56,830
"No, I fucked around and...
yawned too fast and caught--

242
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,916
[audience laughing]

243
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,712
I caught my body off guard.

244
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,007
I wasn't stretching or nothing like that,
like I should.

245
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,134
I just, out of nowhere, yawned. [buzzing]

246
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,512
Ripped all of that up right there."

247
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:19,436
It's fucked up. It's what starts happening
when you start getting older.

248
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,692
You start getting older,
shit that wasn't a problem is a problem.

249
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,487
When you was younger,
if you was 5 pounds overweight,

250
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,532
all you needed to do
was take one good shit.

251
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,283
[audience laughing]

252
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,494
You was back at your original weight.

253
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,249
"I knew I ate a little bit too much
two days ago. I knew that."

254
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:46,296
You start getting older,
if you let 10 pounds get on you,

255
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,635
that bitch is there to stay.
You like, "When the fuck is this leaving?"

256
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,555
It ain't never leaving,
you have to keep on working.

257
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,808
I saw some shit that fucked me up, though.

258
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:02,187
Sometimes, you got so many channels,
you be going through

259
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,940
and you just stop on something
to see what it is,

260
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,775
and it's running on a marathon,

261
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,446
and before you know it,
you done watched 88 episodes.

262
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:16,535
This show fucked me up.
They got a show called My 600-lb--

263
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,996
[audience shouting indistinctly]

264
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,294
When you was younger,
if you saw something fucked up,

265
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:29,631
you just had nightmares. This is worse.
I ain't never seen no shit like this.

266
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,759
Not 600 pounds.

267
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:36,472
Legs everywhere,
bumps on them and shit. Ah!

268
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,852
Motherfucker do nothing but talk, shit,
and eat. "Where's my breakfast?"

269
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,273
He is pimping this bitch.
She's frying eggs and-- "I'm coming."

270
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:51,028
She like the drug dealer. They go,
"I don't know how he get this big."

271
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,948
Yes, you do, bitch! This motherfucker
can't even get out of the bed.

272
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:59,244
Your ass making him 12 square meals a day.
What the fuck?

273
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,792
Watching that shit,
I can't even eat in bed no more.

274
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,086
It's fucked up.

275
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,005
You start getting older, shit changes.

276
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,343
When you younger,
you don't go to the hospital for nothing.

277
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,805
Whatever it is, it's gonna heal itself.

278
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,351
When you start getting older,
you know Jesus is at the hospital.

279
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,604
You need to check in with Jesus.

280
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,941
Catch him on the mainline IV.

281
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:31,902
I think it's got something in it,
you gonna love it.

282
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,071
It's fucked up.

283
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,366
My last young day was last Christmas.

284
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,036
Played basketball in somebody's backyard,

285
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,081
got fouled, ran into a wall,
damn near killed myself.

286
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,294
And I thought I had saved myself
'cause I saved my face... with my arm.

287
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,465
I saved my face with my arm.
But when my arm hit the ground,

288
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,676
it sounded like Transformers. It said:

289
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,678
[mimicking mechanical sounds]

290
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:02,015
And my brain said,
"Get the fuck up off the ground, nigga."

291
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,435
My arm said,
"If you get us up off the ground,

292
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,897
you gonna have to put us in your pocket,
'cause we are done."

293
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:12,651
I got right up off the ground
and went right to the hospital.

294
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,155
White people,
I know that don't sound amazing.

295
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,324
You get hurt,
you supposed to go to the hospital.

296
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:23,620
As a nigga, if you get up off the ground
and go directly to the hospital,

297
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,874
that means you thought
you was fitting to die that day.

298
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,587
I'm in the hospital, looking
at the doctor, holding my arm like a baby.

299
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,632
I said, "I don't know what you fitting
to do... but every time I blink,

300
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,469
it feels like somebody's tearing my arm
out the socket."

301
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,265
He said, "Don't worry,
I'll put you on some medication."

302
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,184
I said, "With all due respect,

303
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,811
I've been smoking
the best weed in the country,

304
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,480
and medication is not gonna get it."

305
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,693
He said,
"You do your job, let me do my job."

306
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,070
He wrote me out two prescriptions.

307
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,449
One for tramadol, and one for Percocet.

308
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,328
Now, I don't know
if y'all done had them separately,

309
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,872
but if you take them bitches together,

310
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,209
it'll make you a superhero in this bitch.

311
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,754
You walking around,
looking for small crimes.

312
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:18,550
Saying shit no nigga has ever said before.
"Shoot me right in the chest.

313
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,595
I ain't even gonna feel it.
I can't feel shit."

314
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,806
You have to be careful.

315
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,436
Your doctor's give you all that
strong-ass motherfucking medication,

316
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,773
they don't tell you
what the fuck it's gonna do...

317
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,234
when they all get together.

318
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,612
You gonna believe that ass Tiger Woods.

319
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:43,909
Tiger was in the police department,
looking like a baby giraffe and shit.

320
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,994
[audience laughing]

321
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:53,293
One, two, three, four, five, six.

322
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:56,421
Strong-ass medication.

323
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,176
Gotta be careful out there,
it's a new world. Myself?

324
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:06,640
I ain't getting in no more
motherfucking trouble for shit.

325
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,185
I know what administration this is.

326
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:13,522
I ain't doing shit.

327
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,609
I done join the Boy Scouts,
the Jehovah Witness, the Amish.

328
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:21,780
It's fucked up.

329
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,701
I saw that Philando Castile
motherfucking video.

330
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,870
That changed my motherfucking life.
Fuck out of here.

331
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,540
That is not supposed
to motherfucking happen.

332
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,836
That nigga wasn't even driving.
Had his seat belt on and everything.

333
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:40,340
You shot him with his baby right there.
Get the fuck out of here.

334
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,301
I got some new shit, though.

335
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,220
I'm fitting to buy me a self-driving car.

336
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,638
[audience laughing]

337
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,807
I'm gonna be in the back seat.

338
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,686
You pull me over, "I don't know
what to tell you. Talk to the driver.

339
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,771
[audience cheering]

340
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,861
Mm-mm.
Talk to the driver, officer, I'm sorry.

341
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,739
I'm here in the back seat,
reading the Bible.

342
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,451
I'm naked with a little pit-bull puppy.
He's in his seat belt."

343
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,749
Just saying.

344
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,044
'Cause it's a new world out there.

345
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,422
This new election changed everything.

346
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,133
Everything has changed.

347
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:26,386
And don't worry, white people,
we not gonna talk politics.

348
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,222
We not gonna say who voted for who.

349
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,183
[audience laughing]

350
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:36,063
We're not gonna get into that. We learned
white people know how to keep a secret.

351
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,441
Y'all didn't tell us shit this election.

352
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,819
Not nothing. We didn't know
white people was up to something

353
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,989
until they started showing
white people in line voting.

354
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:50,077
And all the white people looked like
they had a secret to keep this year.

355
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,162
[audience laughing]

356
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,840
I think white people is up to something.

357
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,178
I can't wait to see what 2018 gonna be.

358
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,972
2017 is already a doozy.

359
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:16,061
We-- We used to seeing people be wrong.
We ain't never seen nobody be this wrong.

360
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:19,272
CNN was wrong, wrong, wrong.

361
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,234
CNN was talking big shit
before the election.

362
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:26,613
They had the map up,
had all the states highlighted and shit.

363
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:31,034
They was talking big shit.
"There's no way that Trump can win this

364
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:36,748
unless he wins here, here, here,
and here."

365
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:42,921
The moment they came back from commercial,
they was sweating and crying and shit.

366
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,006
[audience laughing]

367
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:52,889
They was bringing all the neighborhoods up
separately. "Where's the nigga's vote at?"

368
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,482
White people done took over now.

369
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,862
Shit that used to be black
ain't black no more.

370
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,949
First thing white people took over
was rioting.

371
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,285
Yes.

372
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,663
Riots used to be some black shit.

373
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,750
We'd get so mad, we riot!

374
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,587
White people done took it over.

375
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,257
Let me just say
in front of all these minorities,

376
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,051
y'all are terrible at it, white people.

377
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,180
We taught y'all better than this.

378
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:38,768
Y'all had a million white people out
there, y'all didn't do no damage at all.

379
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,646
Y'all out there obeying the crosswalks,

380
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,066
and passing out orange slices.

381
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,903
Walking in single-file lines, and--

382
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:54,117
White people,
we taught y'all better than this.

383
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,830
If it's a riot, you gotta be willing
to fuck some shit up.

384
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,877
Y'all can't fuck the shit up
'cause y'all own the shit,

385
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,006
so y'all out there fucking it up
and cleaning it up at the same time.

386
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,265
Not a riot, white people.

387
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,686
White people just out there
shaking they signs hard and shit.

388
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,689
[audience laughing]

389
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:32,280
"What you doing, using the Shake Weight?"
"I'm rioting, goddamn it, I'm rioting."

390
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,285
It's just a new change, it's a new era.

391
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,498
They say you don't miss what you got
till it's gone.

392
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,584
And Barack Obama is gone, children.

393
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,504
Oh, I miss that nigga.

394
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,588
[Katt groans]

395
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,424
That nigga ain't never coming back.

396
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,928
Every time you see this nigga,
he doing more white activities.

397
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:57,722
He out there parasailing and shit,

398
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,850
swimming with the sharks
and Michael Phelps,

399
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,478
riding horses bareback.

400
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,608
Barack Obama, get back here.

401
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,319
Nigga, we need you.

402
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,572
You ain't never heard of overtime, nigga?

403
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:16,908
Shit.

404
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,830
Just give us four, five months
to get on our feet right now. It's crazy.

405
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:27,294
They don't wanna give Barack Obama
no credit for nothing.

406
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:30,505
Everything he did,
they're trying to tear it apart.

407
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:34,175
If Barack Obama said,
"Spit on the street,"

408
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,469
they'll say the opposite.

409
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,930
Won't give that nigga
no credit for nothing.

410
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:43,476
He did a great job while he was the
commander in chief of these United States.

411
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,313
He know what he did.

412
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:51,776
We gonna miss him.

413
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:53,486
We gonna miss him.

414
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,156
And who was with him
every step of the way?

415
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,991
Michelle Obama.

416
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:02,829
Showing the world what a real
black stallion look like in real life.

Showing that ass money can't buy.

419
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:14,758
That's collard greens and corn bread
and a PhD.

420
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,514
Whole family did a good job.
Sasha and Malia did a good job.

421
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,392
They wasn't ever pregnant,
or kicked out of school,

422
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,727
or none of that shit.

423
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:29,105
Even their little nappy-headed dog
did a good job.

424
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:33,360
He wasn't ever shitting in the front yard
of the White House, getting caught on TMZ.

425
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,240
We gotta understand that time is over.

426
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:44,412
Black people, we already had our time.
We already had the first black president.

427
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,249
Now it's time for the first
Flamin' Hot Cheeto president.

428
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,920
So, little orange boys and girls know
that they, too, can make it.

429
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,634
If your hair's fucked up,
this is your president.

430
00:27:57,717 --> 00:28:00,720
I can do what I want with this hair.
I can do anything.

431
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,264
That's why I look like
a civil-rights leader,

432
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,559
'cause that's what I need
to be looking like to the police.

433
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,817
Fucked up. But it's new shit now.

434
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,946
Trump is in there, and Trump didn't wait.
We didn't have to worry

435
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,409
what the fuck Trump was fitting to do.
Trump got on that shit immediately.

436
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,079
Day one, Trump was on his shit.

437
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:30,667
He announced his motherfucking cabinet.
It was Hitler, Satan, Darth Vader.

438
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,293
Goddamn, Trump.

439
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,921
What the fuck is you fitting to do?

[audience laughing]

441
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,175

Trump don't give a fuck.

444
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,061
Trump don't follow nobody's rules.

445
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,816
The president supposed to be
at the White House.

446
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,362
Our president is wherever the fuck
he wanna be.

447
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:03,491
He in New York, he in the South,

448
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,368
playing golf.

449
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,163
Our president don't give a fuck.

450
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,709
They used to say, "Will your president
be awake at 3:00 in the morning

451
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,755
to answer the phone if it rings?"
Shit, yeah, our president is up.

452
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:21,384
Our president is a vampire.
That motherfucker sent 23 tweets at 12:30,

We done already seen
what America could be like...

456
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,774
if they had a nice, sensible president.

457
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:40,111
Now, we're fitting to see
what America is like

458
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,490
with a motherfucking bully in that bitch.

459
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,701
Trump don't give a fuck.

460
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,205
The president's supposed
to think of something,

461
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:54,083
then talk with the Senate and Congress,
pass a bill, and then do it.

462
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,294
Trump don't give a fuck.

463
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,838
Trump sent off 50 missiles to Syria

464
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:03,218
while he was in his bathroom
with an Xbox One controller.

465
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,303
[audience laughing]

466
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,272
"See what they say
when they see that shit."

467
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,110
Trump don't give a fuck.

468
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:24,948
That motherfucker is on it,
whatever the fuck it is.

469
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:28,993
Barack Obama was in office eight years,
he did eight things.

470
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,122
Eight years in office,
he did eight things.

471
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:37,043
Trump's been in office 100 days.
He's done 100 fucked-up things.

472
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,547
He wakes up and signs
another fucked-up piece of paper.

473
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,800
"Wait till they see this
when they wake the fuck up."

474
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,762
Trump do not sleep.

475
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,181
He don't play by no rules.

476
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,560
He don't care what the rules is,
he do not play them.

477
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:58,940
He did a speech for Black History Month.
He don't even know which niggas is which.

478
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,733
[audience laughing]

479
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,028
He thought Ben Carson
was Frederick Douglass.

480
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,740
You don't believe me.
He looked at Ben Carson and said:

481
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,743
"Frederick Douglass has
been doing a great job.

482
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,163
He's been getting more
and more recognition every day."

483
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,960
He looked at Omarosa and said,
"And Harriet Tubman has been doing

484
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,421
a great job out in the community as well."

485
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,011
It's fucked up.

486
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,555
It's getting dangerous out there.

487
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,266
As black people, minorities,

488
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:38,771
we're used to just being able to watch
the news a little bit and then walk off.

489
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,523
Not with Trump.

490
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,402
Niggas is watching the news
like it's the playoffs.

491
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,070
[audience laughing]

492
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,910
"They say anything about niggas yet?

493
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,204
We got one more day then. One more day."

494
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,209
Hispanic people, since y'all in here,
I'm gonna let y'all know.

495
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,962
Black people is y'alls friends.

496
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,717
If they come after y'all,
they got to come after us.

497
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,220
And I can say that because we know...

498
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,349
if they start coming after y'all...

499
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,434
[audience laughing]

500
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,858
we next anyway.

501
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,362
Don't worry, Hispanic people.

502
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:31,574
We will open up that Underground Railroad
so quick. We got the blueprints.

503
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,040
Black people,
we got enough problems in America.

504
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,167
We don't need no more problems.

505
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,503
Once they start coming for Hispanics,

506
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,798
there'll be a bunch of light-skin niggas
stuck at the border.

507
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,177
Niggas gonna say,
"I'm not supposed to be here!

508
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,680
I don't even speak Spanish."

509
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,646
Trump in office, we don't know
what the fuck may happen next.

510
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,148
We thought he was gonna be
at war right away.

511
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,402
We was like, "We can't figure out
who gonna catch it first.

512
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,987
Is it gonna be Russia?

513
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,907
Is it gonna be China? Syria? Iran? Iraq?

514
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:16,703
North Korea?
Who the fuck is fitting to get it?"

515
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:22,834
We find out, public enemy number one
is Kathy Griffin.

516
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,840
Kathy Griffin?

517
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,556
Ain't that a bitch?

518
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,434
Get the fuck out of here.

519
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,229
I thought for sure Trump was
gonna have a sense of humor.

520
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:47,650
What the fuck? You the president now,
you can't take a joke, motherfucker?

521
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:52,363
You announced your presidency
on Comedy Central, motherfucker,

522
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,073
after a roast.

523
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,077
It's fucked up.

524
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:02,498
I tried to tell people on the last tour.
It was called Conspiracy Theory.

525
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,793
I tried to tell people
what the fuck was fitting to happen.

526
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,963
And it done fucked around and happened.

527
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,884
We said Trump had a chance
because he was exciting,

528
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,011
and America loves excitement.

529
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,765
And Trump's been saying exciting shit
the whole time.

530
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,684
He say shit you ain't never heard
nobody say ever.

531
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:25,229
Trump said, "We are gonna build a wall,

532
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:31,235
and... we gonna make Mexico pay for it."

533
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,448
Black people all over the world went,
"Mexico?

534
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,533
[audience laughing]

535
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,370
What type of Mexicans does he know?

536
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,833
He must not know no eses, or no vatos.

537
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,253
You ain't gonna make them niggas do shit."

538
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:53,091
But why the fuck is we talking
about building a wall?

539
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,343
The Mexican people have shown us

540
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,014
they are professional at building a tunnel
on your motherfucking ass.

541
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,559
They broke El Chapo out
while they was looking at him.

542
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,062
We went through that.
That's how he got here.

543
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,526
They showed that tunnel.
That tunnel was as big as this stage.

544
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,238
Had hardwood floors,
linoleum, Berber carpeting,

545
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,990
central air conditioning,
vending machines.

546
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,244
They picked him up in a golf cart
and took him to a burro.

547
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,538
[audience laughing]

548
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:27,583
I don't know why Trump was talking
about immigration in the first place.

549
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,503
His motherfucking bitch ain't from here.

550
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:35,216
She's from somewhere else.
She's from Cashnadastan.

551
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:40,221
White people don't look like that.
Y'all need to check on that woman.

552
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,100
Every time you look at her,
she looks like a hostage in an interview.

553
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,185
[audience laughing]

554
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,820
"Someone please help me.
I am not supposed to be here.

555
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,322
This is not what I signed up for."

556
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:04,203
Right then, I said,
"Okay, Trump ain't gonna say no more shit

557
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,164
that throws me off guard."

558
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,834
Then Trump said the shit
that shocked the world.

559
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,546
You was watching the news.
Had your breakfast blunt,

560
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,798
it scared you and your breakfast blunt.

561
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,260
"Trump said, 'Grab them by the pussy.'"

562
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,345
[audience laughing]

563
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,771
Even gangster niggas were shocked. "What?

564
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:33,441
Where the fuck they do that at?

565
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,445
Here we been shaking bitches' hands
and hugging and shit."

566
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,198
Trump don't give a fuck.

567
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,577
You can tell he really be grabbing bitches
by the pussy, too.

568
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:50,166
If you watch the news, Melania will not
grab that motherfucker's hand for nothing.

569
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:54,212
Every time she grab for his hand,
she do karate.

570
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:03,262
"I know where your hand's been,
motherfucker. You are not..."

571
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,098
Trump don't give a fuck.

572
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,851
Trump makes his own rules.

573
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,356
Trump was on the news.
They asked Trump about the leaks.

574
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,361
Trump said, "The leaks are real,
but the news is fake."

575
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,779
[audience laughing]

576
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:32,375
"I heard about the leaks on the news, sir.
You are confusing me."

577
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:37,380
That's like the police pull you over,
you tell them the blunt ain't real,

578
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:38,422
but the smoke is.

579
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,219
"Take your ass to real jail then,
since you are..."

580
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,472
It's a new world out there.

581
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,685
You just gotta know what's true
and let that be true to you.

582
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,647
Don't let them change
what your idea of true is.

583
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:58,651
They try to tell us shit ain't right,
and we know what the answers are.

584
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,112
They try to tell us
ain't no global warming.

585
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:04,949
Get the fuck out of here, motherfucker.
We live on this globe.

586
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:09,078
We know there's global warming.
What the fuck happened to winter?

587
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,084
Won't nobody say shit? Winter is gone!

588
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,714
When we was kids,
winter was 19 months long.

589
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,928
Snowmen used to last
for four, five months.

590
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,098
Now, winter is gone.

591
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,018
Winter used to be from September to April.

592
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,854
Then winter was from November to March.

593
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,482
Now winter is just in Alaska
and New York, that's it.

594
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:39,859
[audience laughing]

595
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,403
Nobody else has seen a winter at all.

596
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,990
"Ain't no global warming." Yes, it is.

597
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,661
Shit's getting aggressive.
Shit's getting more aggressive.

598
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,331
Fast food is getting more aggressive.

599
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,043
Fast food used to be
just a decision you made.

600
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:01,380
Now they're getting aggressive,
and we gotta know when to draw the line.

601
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,926
Taco Bell done started...
trying to trap niggas.

602
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,012
[audience laughing]

603
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,561
I gotta go all around the country
warning my people to beware.

604
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,773
Taco Bell is trying to trap niggas, yes.

605
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,776
They made a taco out of chicken meat.

606
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,613
Yeah, trying to trap niggas in there.

607
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,156
We got to draw the line.

608

No, Taco Bell. No.

00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,578
If we don't stop them now,

610
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:37,458
they'll have chitlin chimichangas
and hog maw nachos. No.

611
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:41,629
We don't want no corn bread churro.

612
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,923
[audience laughing]

613
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,592
Fast food done got more aggressive.

614
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:51,430
You know who I blame for that shit.
That motherfucking Popeyes lady.

615
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:56,852
I love Popeyes, but I can't stand
that motherfucking Popeyes lady.

616
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,564
That bitch is a slave.
Every time you hear her,

617
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,983
she's singing that slave-ass chicken song.

618
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,237
♪ Love that chicken
From Popeye ♪

619
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,781
Shut the fuck up, bitch.

620
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:18,499
I'm gonna let you know, white people,
that bitch does not speak for all niggas.

621
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:23,003
We've been frying chicken
for 400, 500 goddamn years.

622
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,508
This bitch coming up with new recipes.
She ain't checked with niggas at all.

623
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,927
[audience laughing]

624
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:34,723
Every two weeks, she got a new chicken
niggas have never heard of.

625
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,184
"Try our new ghost pepper chicken."

626
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,979
Wait a minute, bitch.

627
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,357
Niggas don't even believe in ghosts.

628
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,361
You done get that voodoo-ass chicken
out of here, bitch.

629
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,781
We are Christians on this side,

630
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,910
Fuck that bitch.

631
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:59,165
Every time she do a commercial,
there's got to be some coonery and shit.

632
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:02,168
She got Jerry Rice
looking like Scatman Crothers

633
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,421
with Vaseline on his face,
with a helmet on,

634
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:08,048
eating chicken wings and dancing and shit.

635
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,221
Everybody getting more aggressive.
The most aggressive is Arby's.

636
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,640
Arby's is aggressive.

637
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:20,769
Every 45 seconds,
Arby's got three new sandwiches

638
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,022
and a brand-new commercial.

639
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,774
They trying to gangster niggas
into coming in there.

640
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:28,277
[scatting]

641
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,030
"We have the meats."

642
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,742
That don't even sound attractive.
Stop saying that.

643
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,952
That does not sound good.

644
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,332
Poor Arby's. Arby's is desperate.

645
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,418
Arby's been cooking for 150 years.

646
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,172
They just found out
niggas do not eat roast beef.

647
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,590
[audience laughing]

648
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,552
Every nigga in here know
where a roast-beef sandwich is, at Arby's.

649
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,847
You wouldn't go to Arby's
to save your life.

650
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,310
If Jesus came back to an Arby's,
you'd have meet him in the parking lot.

651
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:05,439
"No, Jesus, I'm right outside,
soon as you come outside the door.

652
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:09,652
I can't eat nothing out of there
but the curly fries and the Jamocha Shake.

653
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,737
That's the only thing my stomach..."

654
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,822
[audience cheering]

655
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,496
You go to Arby's.
Arby's got 500 items on the menu.

656
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,750
I went to Arby's, they gave me
a sandwich with meatloaf, corn beef,

657
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:29,713

658
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,465

659
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:35,135
on two pieces of hot-water corn bread
for $1.29.

660
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:38,430
It came with two bag of chips
and three drinks.

661
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,599
"Please come to Arby's."

662
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,934
They desperate.

663
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,729
Now, I know that I talk a lot about race.

664
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:51,151
I don't want people to think it's more
racist than it usually is. It's the same.

665
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:55,322
They don't hate all niggas.
They just like some more than others.

666
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,284
If you tall and dark with a deep voice,

667
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:01,870
they love your motherfucking ass.
That nigga is selling the shit

670
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,963
[in normal voice]
White people are like, "I trust him.

671
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:13,299
I think he has our best interests
at heart."

672

You tall and dark with a deep voice,

675
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,314
[as Ving Rhames] "Don't you even think
about coming in here."

676
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,775
[in normal voice]
Get your black ass out of this front yard

677
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,235
before we both get shot.

678
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,863

Samuel L. Jackson is selling the shit

681
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:47,583
That nigga be cleaner
than the Board of Health.

682
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,463
He just sound too edgy at the end,
like he might maybe could rob you.

683
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,381
"What's in your wallet?"

684
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:57,676
Goddamn, Sam. What the fuck?

685
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,889
It's a new world out there.

686
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,100
Gotta take care of yourself,
eat right, drink right.

687
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,270
They got a flu virus out there
that's killing people.

688
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,397
The flu is already bullshit.

689
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:13,442
You don't need to catch the flu and die.

690
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,403
Don't worry about me.
I can't catch the flu.

691
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,531
A lot of y'all don't know,

I done had 22 flu shots.

694
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:31,669
I can't legally catch the flu
until 2026 I think it is.

695
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:36,090
I can't get the flu, tuberculosis.
None of that shit.

696
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,260
I go to jail, they don't take my picture.

697
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,806
They let me pick from my book.
"Which one of these do you like?

698
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,349
You can pick any one."

699
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,020
It's a new world out there.

700
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,730
It's a new world.

701
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,275
When we was young,

702
00:44:55,734 --> 00:45:00,280
"By the time you grow up,
computers is gonna be running the world."

703
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,699
We thought that was impossible.

704
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:08,247
"Ain't no way no motherfucking computers
gonna be interacting with us. Shit."

705
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:13,252

00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,600
"Alexa, what time is it?"

711
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:31,270
She don't say,
"Nigga, find your own clock."

It's true. It's true. Some of you women
is sitting here with men with great dick.

911
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:44,461
And notice I didn't say "big dick."
I said "great dick."

912
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,047
I don't know sizes. I know mine is
as big as it's ever gonna be,

913
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,507
and I leave it at that.

914
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:55,180
As men, we know if we got great dick,
and your woman know, too.

915
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,517
Some of you men look confused.
You don't know if you got regular dick...

916
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,312
or if you got great dick.

917
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,732
This is how you know, fellas,
if you got great dick.

918
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:09,444
If you can let your woman see your penis
before it gets hard.

919
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,115
You can walk right up to the bed,
"You need anything out the kitchen?

921
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,917
I'm gonna get some ice-cold sweet tea
and I'll be ready

922
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,752
to lay that hammer down."

923
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,338
That mean you got it.

924
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,341
That's that great dick.

925
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,635
If you got regular dick,

926
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:37,430
your ass gotta hide all around
the bedroom till your dick get right.

927
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,350
You behind the TV and shit.

928
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:44,479
All behind the curtains and the plants.
"I'll be right there."

That's great dick.

931
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,574
Women don't think we know.

932
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:00,036
Women think all vagina is the same to us.

933
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,538
No the fuck it ain't.

934
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,833
We know when we done laid it down,
but we don't say shit.

935
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:10,630
As a man, we don't say shit.
We just walk away, go in the bathroom,

936
00:59:11,172 --> 00:59:14,884
shut the door, turn on the shower.
We don't even get in the shower.

937
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,553
We be looking in the mirror.
