1
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:30,948
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Steve Martin!</i>

2
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,245
Thank you!

3
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,247
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,375
Thank you.

5
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,168
Wow!

6
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,299
Thank you so much!
It's not necessary.

7
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,843
Thank you.

8
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,307
Thank you. Please be seated.

9
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,854
Marty couldn't make it.
Have a safe ride home.

10
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,609
Right off the top,
I want to apologize for ticket prices.

11
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,113
I know from your point of view,
you're thinking, "It's only two guys.

12
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,239
Why is it so expensive?"

13
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,033
But you know, it takes 18 people
to put this show on.

14
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,995
We have two sound engineers.

15
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,290
We have a lighting director.
We have seven musicians on stage.

16
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,293
We have someone to walk my Fitbit around.

17
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,299
We have an intermediary,

18
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,676
because Marty and I
no longer speak to each other.

19
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,223
We have a celebrity lookalike
in case I don't feel like going on.

20
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,976
Steve says hi, by the way.

21
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,522
But ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:50,152
right now I am so excited
to introduce a man I love to work with.

23
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,572
A man I met over 30 years ago.

24
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,074
A man...

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,534
a man...

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,995
a man who is...

27
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,791
a man who is so, so talented
in so many different ways.

28
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,668
He sings. He dances.

29
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,170
He's an incredible musician

30
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,715
and I consider him to be
the real star of the show tonight.

31
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,801
Mr. Jeff Babko on piano,
ladies and gentlemen.

32
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,644
- Thanks, Steve! You know, I thought...
- Thank you, Jeff.

33
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,648
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
it's time to introduce a man

34
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,652
who's as funny as a barrel of monkeys...
But that's it.

35
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:34,237
Mr. Martin Short!

36
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,416
I love this end the best!

37
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,886
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!

38
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,349
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

39
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,895
Just because I say "thank you"
doesn't mean you have to stop applauding.

40
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:12,442
I can't tell you how humble...

41
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,487
your response
makes a huge star like me feel.

42
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,490
Please be seated.

43
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,243
How are we on time?

44
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,911
- We just started.
- Oh, I see.

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,415
All we ask...

46
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,282
Damn this Greenville altitude!

47
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,160
Melissa!

48
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,870
- It's Jeff.
- Jeff!

49
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,749
Let's try that top note
one more time, shall we?

50
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,766
Damn! Son of a bitch!

51
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,694
Thank you so much!

52
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,405
But stop loving just me.
Remember Steve's here too.

53
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,367
You know, Marty, it's been a long-time
dream of mine to perform a two-man show

54
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,245
right here at the Peace Center
with you in Grinville...

55
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:48,747
- Greenville!
- Grinville?

56
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,207
- Grinville!
- Grinville?

57
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,251
Greenville. You know, I shouldn't have
had that Motrin. Anyway...

58
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,214
In Greenville... South Carolina.

59
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,715
Tonight...

60
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,094
Anyway, tonight, I feel I am
one step closer to that dream.

61
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,771
You know what?

62
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,565
- Steve!
- Let's just leave that as is.

63
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,152
Steve, you'd tell me if you'd had
a stroke, wouldn't you?

64
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,992
But you're right. It is a thrill.

65
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,953
It's actually more than a thrill.

66
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,120
It's an obligation.

67
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,125
Steve and I call this show
<i>If We'd Saved, We Wouldn't Be Here.</i>

68
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,548
- Good night, everybody!
- Hey!

69
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,132
- Marty!
- No!

70
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,427
I looked online at the Peace Center
website and there were our photos

71
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,389
and across them were written the words
"sold out."

72
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,521
And I thought...

73
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,689
how rude.

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,026
Let me just say, Steve...

75
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:05,031
truthfully, what an honor it is
for me to be standing next to a man

76
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,410
who is a novelist, a playwright,
a musician, a composer...

77
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,453
and a legendary comedian.

78
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:15,417
And let me say what an honor it is for me
to be standing next to the man

79
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,752
who is standing next to that man.

80
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,551
You know, Steve, of all the people

81
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,887
that I have a fake show business
relationship with,

82
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,597
I feel fake closest to you.

83
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,639
Buddy!

84
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,235
Oh, by the way,
when Marty and I fly together,

85
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,528
we save a lot of money,

86
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:46,656
because Marty fits conveniently
in the overhead bin.

87
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,159
True. Absolutely true.

88
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,329
Let me just say, I am such a fan.

89
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,665
I mean, I see your work and I'm whelmed.

90
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,880
I think I've seen <i>Cheaper by the Dozen</i>
over 500 times.

91
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,256
Wow! Thank you!

92
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,300
Every time I see it,
I say the same thing.

93
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,469
"Steve, you know,
we could watch something else."

94
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,223
You know what I love about
touring around with Marty Short?

95
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,767
No paparazzi.

96
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,108
When I think of Steve...

97
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,611
And it's not often. But when I do...

98
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,239
the one thing that strikes me
more than anything else about you

99
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,534
is how unbelievably pale
you are in person.

100
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,081
It's like I'm being haunted, you know?
No, really.

101
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,792
I mean, you look like
a page in a coloring book

102
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,460
that hasn't been colored yet.

103
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,801
Steve once got a sunburn
from his Kindle reader. You know?

104
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,933
You look like Anderson Cooper
froze to death on New Year's Eve.

105
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,895
Yes, you do!

106
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,564
Thank you. Thank you.

107
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,361
You look like someone put a white toupee
on a urinal.

108
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,117
Hey, listen to me.
I'm not trying to be negative.

109
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,076
No, I can tell!

110
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,203
- Why?
- But out of curiosity,

111
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,956
how far into the embalming process
did they get

112
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,708
before you woke up screaming?

113
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,376
It must have been frightening for you.

114
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:25,046
We should explain something. It sounds
like we are insulting each other,

115
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,758
but we're actually not. This is the way
we pay compliments in Hollywood.

116
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,385
That's correct. It's true.

117
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,888
Hollywood compliments are a lot like
regular compliments.

118
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,017
But they have a slight passive aggressive
dig at the end.

119
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,476
- I'll give you an example.
- Yeah.

120
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,729
Steve, you know,
it's truly an honor for me

121
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:43,314
to be performing with
the world's biggest star...

122
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,525
from 1978.

123
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,903
Oh, Marty, that is so sweet!

124
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,282
And I often hear people refer to you
as a whole entertainer.

125
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,410
Well, I added the word "entertainer."

126
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,835
And may I say that you look fantastic?

127
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,464
And I guess that's the charm
of looking 70 since you were 30.

128
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,259
Burn!

129
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,513
Hey, Marty, you know I think of you
as a Renaissance Man,

130
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,223
and not just because
you carry smallpox.

131
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,683
You know, I...

132
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,352
I don't often use the word "genius."

133
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,729
- And?
- Nothing.

134
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:27,150
You know, the other day,
Steve butt-dialed me,

135
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,610
which was so impressive,

136
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,779
considering he still uses a rotary phone.

137
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,536
When did you add that?

138
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,288
- Tonight.
- OK!

139
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,417
And by the way, I loved you on
<i>Fallon </i>the other night. Oh, my God!

140
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,836
- Your comedy was so effortless.
- Thank you.

141
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,256
And I kept thinking, I wonder how it'd be
if you'd put a little effort into it.

142
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,927
- Did you see me on <i>Ellen?</i>
- No, I missed that.

143
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,638
Of course. What am I thinking?
That's on at 3 p.m.

144
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,181
And that's when you're having dinner.

145
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,520
By the way,
Martin Short is also the name I use

146
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,147
when I check into a hotel
and want to be anonymous.

147
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:12,320
Thirty-five years later
and you're still the jerk.

148
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,617
And that's how we do it in Hollywood.

149
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:25,041
Steve and I feel that you, the audience,
might like to get to know us better.

150
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,459
Yes. And the reason we think that

151
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,586
- is because we're egomaniacs.
- Correct.

152
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,215
So we'd like to share with you
some of the hidden gems

153
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,801
- from our family photo collections.
- Yes.

154
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,719
These are rarely, if ever, seen
private photos.

155
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,596
- Absolutely.
- Let's look at the first one.

156
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,099
This is Marty when he was just
two years old. Adorable.

157
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,308
That's cute, isn't it?

158
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,144
My dark period. Look at that.

159
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:49,899
And here's a shot of me on Christmas
morning when I was six years old.

160
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,360
Let me ask you something, Steve.

161
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,779
When the guy sold you
that Christmas tree...

162
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,700
how hard was he laughing?

163
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:05,165
This was taken when I was just
a young boy in Texas.

164
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,625
And it's a photo of my first marriage.

165
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,301
- Next!
- Let's go to the next one.

166
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,386
- Ooh!
- Aww...

167
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:24,601
Here's a photo of me
when I was 13 years of age

168
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,436
on the beach with my parents.

169
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:27,854
That's really you?

170
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,939
Because at first I thought it was
Winnie the Pooh.

171
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,819
You know what's amazing about this photo?

172
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,030
How well my parents
are hiding their disappointment.

173
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,702
Oh, and then now that's me at 15.

174
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:46,664
My first trip to New York City.
That's my mom and two brothers.

175
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,584
We went from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada
to New York City.

176
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:50,710
The first trip to New York.

177
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,837
And we were at
the Latin Quarter nightclub.

178
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,130
Now that, that's impressive.

179
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,383
Your family drove you down
from Canada to New York City

180
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,677
to see a nightclub show.
That's pretty sophisticated.

181
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,679
- Do you remember the name of the show?
- Sure.

182
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,599
It was the late Bea Arthur's
one-woman show entitled

183
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,684
<i>You Got It In There, Now Get It Out.</i>

184
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:22,742
Well, I guess we'll work that out later.

185
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,410
Now, let's see the next one.

186
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,663
Oh, yes. This was me

187
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,208
right before I was sent away to camp
to pray the gay away.

188
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:36,923
There you go.

189
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:42,303
Marty, I love this picture of you
as a teenager.

190
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:43,221
Yes.

191
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,433
It was taken right before I created
Apple in my garage.

192
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,522
To me, it looks like someone
who sells macrame on Etsy.

193
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:59,821
Here I am working at Disneyland's
magic shop when I was 15 years old.

194
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,408
And look, that's me
hanging up there behind you. Look at that.

195
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,330
Can we take a closer look at that?

196
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,957
- Oh, yeah.
- There we go.

197
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,129
Somehow that's one of the less creepy
photos of you I've ever seen.

198
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,964
Speaking of creepy...

199
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,802
Come on, we've all done it!

200
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:24,846
Please!

201
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,391
And here's my senior prom.
What a fun night that was.

202
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,101
Look how handsome you were.

203
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,270
- Look how pretty you were.
- Thank you.

204
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,358
I love this dashing picture
of you from your high school yearbook.

205
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,444
You know what's interesting
about this photo?

206
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,154
It's a color photo.

207
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,790
That's my point!
That's what I've been saying.

208
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,293
I love this dashing photo of you
from high school.

209
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,423
Well, now you're being cruel.

210
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,635
That was the year I was voted
Most Likely to Marry a Cousin.

211
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,434
It's even got your grade point average
up there.

212
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:15,396
I'll tell you what I love
about this photo.

213
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,190
It proves

214
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,983
that anyone can make it.

215
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,862
Ooh!

216
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,449
Tell us about this photo, Steve.

217
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,242
I call this picture...

218
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:29,786
"Hello, ladies."

219
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,039
"Goodbye, ladies."

220
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,588
This is an exclusive.

221
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,134
This is the first photo
of the new border wall.

222
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,937
That'll keep them out.

223
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:01,609
And this is what it would
look like if cocaine had a face.

224
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:10,118
Oh, I love this pic. This is
actually you in the actual Oval Office.

225
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,369
Yes, it was.

226
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,081
It was 1994, and you're probably wondering
what I'm doing.

227
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,707
I know what you're doing. Question is,

228
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,584
did Bill Clinton
take you up on your offer?

229
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,055
Now let's take a look at our last photo.

230
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,224
Look how happy you are.

231
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,270
You know,
this was June 28th 2009.

232
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:41,065
- Thank you, Rain Man.
- You're welcome.

233
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,943
But I remember why you were laughing
and smiling so hard.

234
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,403
- Why?
- I had just told you

235
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,406
that one day we'd be so desperate,
we'd be working together.

236
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,077
You know, Marty and I met on the film

237
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,829
<i>- The Three Amigos.</i>
- Yes.

238
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:02,295
<i>The Three Amigos,</i> a movie that has been
recently labeled a classic.

239
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,464
Downgraded from masterpiece.

240
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,175
Next stop, just OK.

241
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:10,553
And it was on that movie
that I first realized

242
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,139
that Marty had this kind of
quirky sense of humor.

243
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:16,142
We'd only been on the movie a couple of
weeks, so I knew him for two weeks.

244
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,312
And there's a lot of down time
on the movie, so Chevy, Marty, and I

245
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,565
would pass time by playing Scrabble
in one of our trailers.

246
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,108
And so we're playing Scrabble.

247
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:28,362
I look over at Marty, whom I don't really
know, and he's writing a note.

248
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,365
He folds it over and slides it to me,
and it said,

249
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,828
"I will let you ball my wife Nancy
for an E or a Q."

250
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,253
I tend to be competitive.

251
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:49,884
<i>The Three Amigos </i>was so amazing for me,
you know, because it was my first movie.

252
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,594
And for a first movie,

253
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:55,556
I'm suddenly put on equal billing
to two massive movie stars.

254
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,683
Or... so they told me.

255
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,601
And...

256
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:02,271
I remember the opening night of
<i>The Three Amigos </i>was like out of a movie.

257
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:06,901
It was insane. It was like, you know,
2,000 people lining Hollywood Boulevard

258
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,528
in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater.

259
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,614
And the studio had asked
the three of us to show up

260
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,658
in our full <i>Three Amigos </i>regalia,

261
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,536
with the hats and the bolero jackets
and the spurs.

262
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,330
But at 4 p.m. that afternoon...

263
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,875
I called Chevy and said, "Let's wear
our tuxes and not tell Marty."

264
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,132
- Bastard!
- I don't care.

265
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,469
- Let's sit and chat.
- Absolutely. If we only had chairs.

266
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,555
- Look at that.
- Oh! Oh, boy, here I go!

267
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:37,139
Be careful!

268
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,811
All aboard! OK, look at that.

269
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:42,812
Oh, boy!

270
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,731
- We should have rehearsed that.
- Yeah, it was good.

271
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:49,360
I love that picture of you so much in
Manhattan seeing a nightclub show.

272
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,071
And I know you grew up
in Hamilton, Ontario,

273
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,199
loving the crooners. Frank Sinatra.

274
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:58,369
I did. It was odd, because, you know...

275
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:02,415
I mean, this was the '60s, and all kids
my age, you know, 12, 13, 14,

276
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,041
were the Beatles and the Stones.

277
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,627
But I had this great attic bedroom,

278
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,672
and I had tape recorders
and record players,

279
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:13,467
and I'd go up and just listen
to the great singers

280
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,847
like Tony Bennett, and I'd listen to
an album, like, eight times in a row,

281
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,557
trying to figure out how he placed notes.

282
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,564
You know?

283
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,065
Pretty good.

284
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,152
But the most amazing thing for me
was Frank Sinatra.

285
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,486
I mean, he was a miracle.

286
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,364
I loved him in the '40s and the '50s,

287
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,617
but in the Swinging '60s...

288
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,290
Wow!

289
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,250
- But it was the...
- Yeah!

290
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,421
But it's...

291
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,174
When he got into his late 70s...

292
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,801
that was my favorite,

293
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,804
because he was singing
all the wrong material, you know?

294
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:10,024
- You know?
- You met him, right?

295
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:10,941
- I did.
- Yeah.

296
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:15,279
I was terrified to meet him, I think
as often you are of your heroes.

297
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,032
And... But I was at this

298
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,368
unbelievable Hollywood party.

299
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,371
It was September 26th 1992.

300
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,667
- It was at the home of George Schlatter...
- Oh, yeah.

301
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,002
...the great Hollywood producer
who did <i>Laugh-In.</i>

302
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,463
And you walked into this house

303
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,384
and it was like you were walking into
a Hollywood wax museum.

304
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,303
I mean, everyone was famous.

305
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,097
You looked over there

306
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,477
and Jimmy Stewart
was telling a story about his dog, Sam.

307
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,439
Over there, Katharine Hepburn's
talking to Paul Newman.

308
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,859
She's saying, "I love Sundays, Paul.

309
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,152
I always did.

310
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,113
I wake up very early.

311
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,657
I have a huge bowl of bran.

312
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:10,751
The next few hours, I am indisposed
and then it's Monday."

313
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:17,133
But the most amazing moment
of all these people was I look over

314
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,677
and there's a 77-year-old Frank Sinatra

315
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,846
just standing by himself at the bar
with a drink.

316
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,139
So I go, "Oh..."

317
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:26,726
I have to do this.
So I go up to him and I say...

318
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,602
"Mr. Sinatra...

319
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,938
my name is Martin Short.

320
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,065
You have no idea.

321
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:38,696
You have no concept
of how big a fan I am of yours."

322
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,448
And he looked at me and said...

323
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,992
"I think I do."

324
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,954
He said, "What are you drinking, kid?"

325
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,414
And I said, "Oh, well,

326
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,624
whatever you're having, Frank."

327
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,294
So he turned to the bartender and said,
"Jack Daniel's."

328
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,796
And the bartender said,
"Straight up or on the rocks?"

329
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:58,883
But I was nervous. I thought he said,
"Straight up or relaxed?"

330
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:01,635
So I said, "Oh, I'll have it relaxed."

331
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,764
Frank said, "He said,
'Straight up or on the rocks?'"

332
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,308
So I'd known Frank 15 seconds
and I'd already pissed him off.

333
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,392
You know?

334
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:11,145
You know, what amazes me
about that story is

335
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,855
you were an adult.

336
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,565
Yes! I was.

337
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,194
You had been around. You were fairly
sophisticated. How old were you?

338
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,904
I was 47.

339
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,159
That proves my point that we always carry

340
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,871
this ounce of naivete with us, no matter
what we've done or where we've been.

341
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,289
You know, and I can prove it.

342
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,876
Marty and I used to go
to St. Barts every Christmas

343
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,504
for a visit with a bunch of friends.

344
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:39,465
And St. Barts started
as a little funky Island

345
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,176
with little ramshackle restaurants
on the beach,

346
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,763
but through the years, it became
a kind of a celebrity hang-out

347
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,890
and then paparazzi started to show up.

348
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,725
And the goal of the paparazzi

349
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,063
is to get the absolute worst possible
photo of you possible.

350
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,900
I can prove it. Here's a photo of us that
actually ran in the <i>National Enquirer.</i>

351
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,699
Oh, boy, look at that!

352
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,451
Look at that right there.

353
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,915
And they had a perfectly decent photo
of us that they didn't run.

354
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,875
Do you have that? There you go.

355
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,255
- Let me ask you this.
- OK.

356
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,841
I find this fascinating about you.
'Cause you have been...

357
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,551
famous

358
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,054
for, what, eight, nine years now?
No, really.

359
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,515
You have been massively famous

360
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:32,601
for well over 40 years.
How odd has that been?

361
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,479
Well, obviously,
it's a different kind of life.

362
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,941
And, you know, things happen
that wouldn't happen ordinarily

363
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,192
and you kind of remember them.

364
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,821
Then eventually you just remember
the two or three kind of odd things

365
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,991
that happen, like... Actually, this just
happened a couple of months ago.

366
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,661
I was in Santa Barbara, walking down
the street, and a young girl about 16

367
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:54,331
came up to me and said,
"Did you do that movie <i>The Jerk?"</i>

368
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,292
And I said, "Yes, I did."

369
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:58,961
And she said,
"You gonna do another movie?"

370
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,264
It's also perfect circumstance
for left-handed compliments.

371
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,433
They think they're complimenting you
but they're not.

372
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,979
We always screen a comedy movie
to test it to see if it gets laughs.

373
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,731
So we did that in the '80s sometime.

374
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:21,817
We had a test screening,
and after the movie,

375
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,278
a woman spotted me
and came over and said,

376
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,907
"Oh, I love this movie!
And my husband loved it

377
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,408
and he <i>hates </i>you."

378
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,249
Even my own mother could do it.

379
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:41,962
I had a movie open one weekend and
on Monday, she called me up and she said,

380
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:46,216
"Oh. Some friends of mine
went to the movies last weekend,

381
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,386
and they couldn't get in anywhere,
so they went to see yours."

382
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,223
That's a...

383
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,476
That's a Hollywood compliment!

384
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,062
My mother died when she was 91.

385
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:01,357
And toward the end,
she was a little bit senile,

386
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,278
which is, you know, quite poignant,
but also could be sometimes quite funny.

387
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,448
Once I was talking to her and she said...

388
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,576
"Where's Glenn?" That was my father.

389
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:16,121
And I said,
"Well, he died three years ago."

390
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:17,623
And she said...

391
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:21,251
"Well, that explains a lot."

392
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,135
Oh, that's great!

393
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,930
I love your story
about meeting Frank Sinatra.

394
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:37,518
I also met some pretty good people too.
I met Cary Grant.

395
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,645
- Wow!
- I met Fred Astaire. I met Elvis.

396
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,814
That was the biggest get of all.

397
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,148
It was about 1970.

398
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:47,611
I was just a young comedian and I was
opening for Ann-Margret in Las Vegas.

399
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,281
And I knew Elvis was coming to see
the show, because they were friends.

400
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,784
And so I did my act, and now
I'm waiting after the show.

401
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,912
I leave my dressing room door open
'cause I know Elvis is coming back.

402
00:24:56,996 --> 00:25:00,332
I'm just kind of standing there waiting
and he walks by me and looks and goes...

403
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,710
"Sir...

404
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,753
You have an oblique sense of humor."

405
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:10,634
And then he came in
and we started talking.

406
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,305
And I was very flattered, because
Elvis has a guy whose sole job it is

407
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,516
to get him out of conversations.

408
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,560
So the guy came up and said,

409
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:23,355
"Elvis, we have to go."
And Elvis said, "It's OK."

410
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:29,445
And so we talked a little bit more.
And Elvis was a big gun collector.

411
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:33,073
He liked exotic guns,
engraved things and pearl handles,

412
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,492
and finally, when we ran out
of conversation, he said,

413
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,202
"Wanna see my guns?"

414
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,413
And I said, "Sure."

415
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,999
And so he had three guns on him.

416
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,376
He did.

417
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,713
First one was a little engraved derringer.
He's very safety-conscious.

418
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,007
He took the bullets out
before he handed it to me.

419
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,593
And I'm admiring them and eventually

420
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:57,222
I'm holding three guns
and Elvis is holding eighteen bullets.

421
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,268
And I'm thinking...

422
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:03,812
Where is Elvis's guy?

423
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,655
And I realize that
I now have to get my guy

424
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,784
to get me out of conversations
with Elvis.

425
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,119
Not something you'd ever think about!

426
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,040
- It's absolutely true, by the way.
- That's hilarious!

427
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,959
Now I have a question for you.

428
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,545
You do something I don't.
You do characters, impressions.

429
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,965
When you do an impression of someone,
do they ever get mad at you?

430
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:33,801
Well...

431
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:38,388
When you do a new character,
hopefully they don't find out, you know.

432
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:42,267
But when you do a new character,
you kind of... You do have to base it

433
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,813
or I do, on someone you've met
in your life, even in your childhood.

434
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,732
It kind of gives the character
three dimensions.

435
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:53,946
And in the year 1984, '85, I was
a cast member of <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

436
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,285
And...

437
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:05,457
the head of makeup that year
was a woman named Marion Siebert.

438
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:11,505
And Marion was the most defensive
human being you'd ever met in your life.

439
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,674
You'd sit in her makeup chair.

440
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,342
And she always chain-smoked.

441
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,803
You could do that inside in 1984 then.

442
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,264
And she'd be dabbing your makeup
and smoking.

443
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:23,350
And you'd say, "Gee, Marion,
I look a little pale, don't I?"

444
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:27,396
And she'd say, "I know that!
I'm a makeup artist. I would know that."

445
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:30,315
"Sorry!" You know?

446
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,192
So about a month later,

447
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,571
Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest,
Harry Shearer and I

448
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,907
are writing a satiric piece
on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

449
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:43,412
I was going to play the defensive
lawyer who always represents the bad guy.

450
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,207
And we called him Nathan Thurm.

451
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:50,169
But I didn't know how to play it.
I didn't know I should do it.

452
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:54,173
And Billy Crystal said,
"Why don't you do it as Marion Siebert?

453
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,761
You impersonate her behind her back
all the time anyway."

454
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,225
And I said, "No, but she'll find out."

455
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,269
"She won't know," he said.

456
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,062
"They never know," he said.

457
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,024
So I said, "OK, good idea. I'll do it."

458
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,776
So I even got a cigarette,
same brand as Marion's,

459
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,529
but I put a wire in it,
so that as it burned down,

460
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,781
the ash would never fall off,
you know?

461
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,742
So I go to the set,

462
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,746
and I forget that Marion is there,
of course,

463
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:28,665
because she's the head of makeup.
So she's over there.

464
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,792
I'm here with my cigarette.

465
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:33,670
Harry Shearer is playing Mike Wallace
and he says,

466
00:28:33,754 --> 00:28:37,633
"Mr. Thurm, you've admitted your client
was breaking the law at that point."

467
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,010
I say, "I know that!
You don't think I know that?

468
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,511
I'm a lawyer. I would know that."

469
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,518
And the director goes,
"Cut! He's sweating."

470
00:28:48,602 --> 00:28:51,730
Marion says, "I know that! You don't
think I know that? I'm a makeup artist."

471
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,989
It was insane.

472
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:04,910
But, you know, when a character
becomes popular on <i>SNL,</i>

473
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,537
you're kind of expected to do it again.

474
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:11,792
And every time I did Nathan Thurm,
I was terrified I would get caught,

475
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,252
and I never got caught.

476
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,463
But then after the last show,
there was a big, big, big party.

477
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,299
And Marion's assistant got drunk.

478
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,470
He went into her office and said, "Marion!

479
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,889
How stupid are you?

480
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,061
Don't you know that you're Nathan Thurm?

481
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,731
Everybody else does!"

482
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,818
And she was devastated.

483
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,363
She was so upset, you know,
and she came up and she confronted me.

484
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,241
She said, "I thought you were my friend."

485
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:47,536
And I said, "Marion, I <i>am </i>your friend.

486
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:49,288
But you know that...

487
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,666
impersonation is the highest form
of compliment."

488
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,753
She said, "I know that. You don't think
I know that? I read books. I know that."

489
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,934
Now, Marty, there's a piano over there
and I think you are underrated

490
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,228
as a singer, which I completely get.

491
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,815
I'm wondering, would you do a tune for us?

492
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,899
Well, I mean...

493
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,945
I suppose I...

494
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:26,158
I suppose I could. That is...
if you'd really like me to.

495
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,242
Ah!

496
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,245
Well, you heard them.

497
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,330
A resounding no.

498
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,415
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Martin Short.

499
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,416
Thank you.

500
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:39,963
Thank you, Steve.

501
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:46,178
Boy, does his cologne linger or what? Wow!

502
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:51,600
It's so nice for me to perform with
someone who's a potential organ donor.

503
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,234
I'm going to keep this brief,
because I left my Uber driver waiting

504
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,237
and you know how testy
Steve Bannon can get. So...

505
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,582
But I adore Steve Martin. I really do.

506
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,626
He's one of my oldest friends.

507
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:24,466
Steve and I are like Donny and Marie
without the sexual tension.

508
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:33,141
We go together like Ellen DeGeneres
and a vest.

509
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,268
I mean, it's a team, is what I'm saying.

510
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,729
And hanging out with Steve Martin,

511
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:39,856
well, it's a lot like the movie
<i>Deliverance.</i>

512
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,111
It's all fun and games
until the banjos come out.

513
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,743
Thank you.

514
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,747
Now, you know,
when Steve plays his banjo...

515
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,836
I like to close my eyes and pretend
I'm on hold with Cracker Barrel.

516
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,221
One time I asked Steve... I said,

517
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:15,225
"What would you be doing if you weren't
a talented comedic actor?" He said...

518
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,561
"Probably what you're doing."

519
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,231
But I'm so happy

520
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,691
to be here tonight.

521
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,611
Although that could be the Vicodin
and Xanax talking, but I don't think so.

522
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,864
Because for me, there's no...

523
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,284
greater high than performing
in front of a live audience.

524
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:39,666
No greater high.

525
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,585
In fact, the only difference
between you people

526
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,212
and pure-grade pharmaceutical morphine...

527
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,882
is that morphine doesn't judge.

528
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,137
Of course, performing live,
you have to stay fit.

529
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,724
You know, I've been on Jenny Craig
more times than Mr. Craig.

530
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,941
But you know... Listen. Let me tell you.

531
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:08,862
There is a lot of pressure
to stay looking good in show business.

532
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,114
stay looking good.

533
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:14,284
There are of course many rules
in show business.

534
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:18,872
You always take penicillin
after a Leonardo DiCaprio pool party.

535
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,295
When you pick up Kevin Hart, you always
have to remember to cradle the neck.

536
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,596
You never sneak up on Gwyneth Paltrow
during a cleanse.

537
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,889
That can be a mistake.

538
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,979
Always let Steve Harvey's mustache
sniff your hand before you pet it.

539
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:43,897
I mean...

540
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,157
You never embark on a conversation
with Matthew McConaughey

541
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,575
without an exit strategy.

542
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,788
You never say to Bill Cosby,

543
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,624
"Hey, Bill. Could you fix my wife
a drink?" You don't do it!

544
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,128
You don't do it, Jeff.

545
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:11,967
It's interesting.

546
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,177
On the cab ride here tonight...

547
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,846
Because the Peace Center
wouldn't send a car.

548
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,307
I was reflecting on the original impetus
of why I wanted to...

549
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,560
- Ow!
- Oh, for God's sake!

550
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,603
How does something like that happen?

551
00:34:23,687 --> 00:34:25,564
Hey, say hello to Jeff Babko, everyone.

552
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,357
The fabulous Jeff Babko!

553
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,361
Keyboard player for <i>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</i>
every night,

554
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,029
- Thank you.
- We love you, Jeff.

555
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,073
You know, he's one of my oldest friends.

556
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,952
He was there when all three
of my children were conceived.

557
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:44,124
I know 'cause I was out of town
making a movie at the time.

558
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,836
Anyway, Jeff, thank you
for being here tonight.

559
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,045
Great to be here, Marty.

560
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:53,216
I was thinking today at the hotel
earlier about my musical training

561
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,343
and I know we've talked about it before,

562
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,471
but I learned so much about timing
and its relationship

563
00:34:58,555 --> 00:35:01,474
to harmony and melody in music,
and it reminded me

564
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:04,144
of the important kind of
symbiosis that...

565
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,061
Oh, I'm sorry.

566
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:06,896
Sorry.

567
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,232
Shh.

568
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,029
You've got to stop talking now because...

569
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,658
- that was really a dull story.
- I wasn't quite done.

570
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:21,369
I mean, people think
pills killed Marilyn Monroe.

571
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,580
You stopped by. That's what happened.

572
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,963
I have the legs of a marionette, don't I?
Look at that.

573
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,897
First of all, no muscle tone.
That's one of the...

574
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,734
I think these socks were a mistake.

575
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,070
They worked in the drawer, I'll tell you.

576
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,073
I think they're a little <i>Wizard of Oz-y</i>
for their own good.

577
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,035
Can't you just see the house landing
on the witch and this thing happening?

578
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:15,340
- How does a man sit on a piano? It's...
- Not like that.

579
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,550
This isn't good. You can't do that.

580
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,429
This is a little coy, I think.

581
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,349
Little gentle here.
Well, I'll just leave it like that.

582
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,433
- Down.
- What?

583
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,519
- Down.
- Oh. Come on!

584
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,396
Anyway...

585
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,402
On the carriage ride here tonight...
'Cause I love to pamper myself.

586
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,406
...the driver said, "What is the name
of the film you made I hated?"

587
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:42,033
And I thought,
"Oh, my God, he knows my work."

588
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:43,910
Then it dawned on me.

589
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:47,831
Here's a man who hates me for my work,
but doesn't know me well enough

590
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,290
to hate me for who I am.

591
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,919
So that's why tonight I'm going
to tell you a little bit about my life,

592
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:54,462
a little bit about my journey.

593
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,881
As you may or may not know, I'm Canadian.

594
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:00,802
That's it?

595
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,887
- Are we at war?
- Two people.

596
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:07,058
We're the aliens you <i>don't </i>deport.

597
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,194
I just turned 67 years of age.

598
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,071
No work.

599
00:37:20,822 --> 00:37:21,740
No work.

600
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,451
I know you're thinking, "No kidding!"

601
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,372
'Cause cosmetic surgery
doesn't work on a man.

602
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,082
You know, you get this look.

603
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,500
Hello.

604
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,796
No, I've just lost weight.

605
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,633
Wonderful story!

606
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:47,474
No one says,
"Who's that 38-year-old dude?"

607
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,227
They say, "Who's the 67-year-old
who's been in a fire?"

608
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,486
Wonderful story!

609
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,616
Anyway, my first love
has always been the theater.

610
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,119
Then comes movies and television
and then my family.

611
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,664
I have three children.

612
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:12,957
One of each.

613
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:14,959
What?

614
00:38:17,337 --> 00:38:20,089
I grew up in a house filled with love.

615
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:24,260
In that our cousin lived with us
and she put out. And...

616
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,850
She used to say,
"It's better to have loved a Short

617
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:32,727
than never to have loved a tall."

618
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,484
Clever Lena is what we called her.

619
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,779
More than anything in the world...

620
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,781
I adored my parents.

621
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,991
Especially my mom.

622
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,785
God rest her soul.

623
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,579
She's not dead yet.

624
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,624
But it's not looking good,
I'll tell you that much.

625
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,670
My father was a little more complicated.

626
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:01,464
You know, he was Irish.
So there was a lot of...

627
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,179
I used to say, "Dad, why make that noise?
Just drink the gin," you know.

628
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:13,434
I don't know if anyone's had a parent
who tippled...

629
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:15,228
but my father...

630
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,440
What are you staring at?

631
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,401
My father...

632
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,361
Very successful guy.

633
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,031
You know, Vice President
of Canadian Steel.

634
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,117
But he loved to take a sip.

635
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,286
And the second he got home from work,

636
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,621
he would have a gin and ginger, no ice.

637
00:39:34,122 --> 00:39:35,248
As the Irish do.

638
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,334
And he would sip and sip and sip
until he went to bed,

639
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,837
and then on the weekends,
he'd drink all weekend.

640
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,423
He wouldn't start that early,
seven in the morning. And...

641
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,551
Around three in the afternoon
on a Saturday,

642
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,845
you'd look over at him.
It wasn't like he was slurring,

643
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,681
but you suddenly realized
his hair was drunk.

644
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,016
You know?

645
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,779
He was always
teaching the secret of golf.

646
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,198
You know, Marty...

647
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:12,035
I was talking to this Jewish chap
at the club.

648
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,122
Goldberg or Silver or Bronstein.

649
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:20,335
I can't remember. I know there was
a precious metal involved in his name.

650
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:27,300
He said to me, "You know, Charlie,
I'm half-Irish and I'm half-Jewish."

651
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,594
And I said, "You know, Stan...

652
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,597
I am from Crossmaglen, County Armagh.

653
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,933
And in Armagh,

654
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:39,187
we have a term for someone
who is half-Irish and half-Jewish.

655
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,773
We call them a Jew."

656
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,364
Anyway, Marty, did you hear about
the blind prostitute?

657
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,949
You had to hand it to her.

658
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:57,372
Then the fights would start, you know.

659
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:02,043
But I was the youngest of five, so I could
sneak off to my fabulous attic bedroom,

660
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,046
where everything was bliss,
and I'd listen to Frank and Tony.

661
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,715
But eventually I had to leave the attic.

662
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,345
Mainly because I was 23 years of age

663
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,097
and my parents had sold the house.

664
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:17,266
But where was I to go?

665
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,729
The year... 1972.

666
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:27,276
And at that time, Off-Off-Broadway
was obsessed with two things.

667
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,197
Religious musicals
and full frontal nudity.

668
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,784
I auditioned for <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

669
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:36,661
But I didn't get it.

670
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,663
Then I auditioned for <i>Hair.</i>

671
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,540
And I didn't get it.

672
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:43,668
Then I auditioned for an all-nude...

673
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,338
tribal rock musical
of the second-greatest story ever told.

674
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,382
<i>Step-Brother to Jesus.</i>

675
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,968
And a terrible thing happened.

676
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,469
I got it.

677
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,785
Hello, ladies.

678
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,209
I know what you're thinking.

679
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,046
Remember it's the theater.

680
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,800
Objects may appear smaller
than they actually are.

681
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,054
Don't pity me.

682
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,851
My rock bottom
is still your wildest dreams.

683
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,489
Top that, motherfucker.

684
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,537
Martin Short, ladies and gentlemen.

685
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,175
You know, people on crack ask Marty,

686
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,010
"Hey, can you slow down just a bit?"

687
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,306
This is a banjo and...

688
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,934
Thank you.

689
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,481
There's a big difference
between the banjo and the guitar.

690
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:56,777
The banjo has a round pot, it's called,
with a skinhead stretched over the top

691
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:58,487
and it projects the sound outward,

692
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,865
and the guitar can get you laid.

693
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,002
You always have to tune.

694
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,587
It's very hard

695
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,298
to tune a stringed instrument
in an environment like this

696
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,842
with the air conditioning
and the heat of the lights..

697
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:23,137
It's kind of a...
You know, a physics issue.

698
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:27,516
I could teach it to you,
but it's probably...

699
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,269
It's pretty sophisticated.

700
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:34,190
Well, I'll give it a go.
See, what happens is...

701
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,484
the photons...

702
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,988
come down and strike the protons

703
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:44,742
and that agitates the muons...

704
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,161
and the gluons

705
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,122
so that the moron can play.

706
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,254
You know, I was once asked...

707
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,257
"Steve, when your imagination goes dry,

708
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,009
how do you replenish
your creative vessel?"

709
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,472
And I said, "Really, can you just finish
the prostate exam?"

710
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:18,276
But I do write songs, and every once
in a while, I'm asked,

711
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,278
"Steve, where do you get your ideas
for songs?"

712
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:24,115
And I find the best ideas
come in the silences.

713
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:26,617
The silence of a sunrise.

714
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,704
The silence of a sleeping baby.

715
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:34,041
The silence on a woman's face
while making love to her.

716
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:41,173
Young inventive banjo players
come up to me and say,

717
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:44,677
"Steve, how can I get my music
out in front of people like you have?"

718
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,556
I always say the same thing. Two things.
"One, be very creative.

719
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,225
Don't let anyone tell you
how to write your music.

720
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,269
And two, already be famous."

721
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,651
I was raised in the '60s
in the era of the protest song,

722
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:03,279
with Joan Baez and Pete Seeger
and Bob Dylan.

723
00:47:03,404 --> 00:47:07,033
And I always loved that music, but I never
wrote a protest song in my life

724
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:10,453
until about three and a half years ago.
This song just came to me

725
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:13,748
and I thought, "I must mean this.
This has really come from my heart."

726
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:17,460
It's called "Let's Keep the Minimum Wage
Right Where She's At."

727
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,052
I don't have anything. All right.

728
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,554
Here's...

729
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:31,682
Here's a medley of a couple of banjo
songs I've written through the years.

730
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,249
Thank you.

731
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:09,710
Thank you very much.

732
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,088
The Steep Canyon Rangers,
ladies and gentlemen.

733
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,135
Thank you.

734
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:22,723
You know, I've been playing the banjo
for over 50 years.

735
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,974
But...

736
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:28,437
I'm relatively new to playing
live on stage with a band.

737
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,648
It's a discipline,
and it takes some practice.

738
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,067
And I'll be honest with you.
Some nights I come off stage

739
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,361
and think, "Wow, I played great tonight.
Fantastic!"

740
00:52:35,444 --> 00:52:37,696
Other nights I think,
"I wish I'd played better."

741
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:40,324
So I went to check out
this live performance thing

742
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,993
and I went to see
Eric Clapton play live.

743
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:46,664
And I thought...

744
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,874
"He's not so funny."

745
00:52:56,215 --> 00:53:00,094
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to take a moment to recognize the band.

746
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,775
I guess. I don't know.

747
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:17,569
You know, Marty and I
love this band, actually.

748
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:21,031
The Rangers have this beautiful tour bus,
and it's really nice.

749
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,575
After each show, we all go out there
and hang out.

750
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,870
And the instruments come out
and a little wine, maybe.

751
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,873
We talk about how the show went,
and it's kind of a beautiful thing.

752
00:53:29,998 --> 00:53:32,543
It's a blast, obviously.

753
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,003
Sometimes there's tears.
And I told Marty, I said,

754
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,630
"We're not gonna be doing this forever.

755
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:40,259
We gotta get a photo of the Rangers
in their tour bus for our memory box."

756
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,344
We got a great picture. Can you show that?

757
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:58,694
Actually, I'm happy right now
to have this time alone,

758
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:01,029
because I can talk about
one of my favorite things

759
00:54:01,113 --> 00:54:02,614
without my work wife in the way.

760
00:54:02,698 --> 00:54:05,492
It's the parts of the banjo.
People always ask me,

761
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,704
"Can you name the various parts
of the banjo?" And I...

762
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:43,197
[imitates "Amazing Grace"
as played by bagpipes"

763
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:27,157
That you laughed at that
makes me very disappointed in you.

764
00:55:29,785 --> 00:55:32,329
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
some of you may know I started out

765
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,623
as a magician and juggler,
but what you may not know

766
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,084
is that I also started out
as a ventriloquist,

767
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,920
and I'd like to show you
some of those skills tonight.

768
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:44,716
Hello!

769
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:49,805
My little wooden-headed friend,
Jiminy Glick.

770
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,098
- Hello!
- Wow!

771
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:53,559
Isn't it wonderful to be here, Steve?

772
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,686
I love Greenville!

773
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:58,522
What a wonderful town.
Look how sexy the audience is.

774
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,523
Jiminy!

775
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,026
Look at that lady.

776
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:04,736
I love the ladies, Steve.

777
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,656
And she's wearing a low-cut dress.

778
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,783
I wish my fingers were scissors

779
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,619
and I'd snip those straps
and release the hostages.

780
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,413
Oh, Jiminy!

781
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,583
What a handsome man you are.
Look at you!

782
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,585
Your teeth are so white.

783
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,296
Your smile is like an email from Grandma...

784
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:23,505
All caps.

785
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,846
Now, Jiminy, you hang out
with the big celebrities.

786
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,723
Well, clearly this is my night off.

787
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,935
- You're one of the great critics of style.
- Thank you.

788
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,980
So I thought we'd take a look
at some photos of people in the news

789
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,900
and you can tell us whether you think
they do or do not have style.

790
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:45,444
Oh, I think this is wonderful
and fun-sounding.

791
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,322
- Let's take a look.
- Let's take a look at our first picture.

792
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:52,034
Oh, Kim Kar... Well, she's a lovely girl,
Steve. But you know,

793
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,410
she's not bright.

794
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,287
- Oh, that's not nice!
- No, please.

795
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:58,290
She thinks soy milk
is Spanish for "I am milk."

796
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,171
- Of course, I was at her wedding.
- Ooh!

797
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:07,841
Oh, yes. Her dress was stunning.
Kim wore white because, you know,

798
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:09,259
she can be ironic.

799
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,512
But let's see Kim without all that makeup.

800
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:14,640
There you go.

801
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:20,479
But you know what, Steve?
You can't deny the lady has style.

802
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:21,563
She does. Who's next?

803
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:24,149
- Bernie Sanders.
- Bernie Sanders.

804
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:27,319
Well, Bernie Sanders,
everybody felt the bern.

805
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,530
But the reality was, he didn't have
a chance to be president.

806
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,032
- That's terrible. Why?
- Too old.

807
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,785
Oh, Steve, he's 76 years old.

808
00:57:35,035 --> 00:57:37,454
At his age, the only time
he doesn't have to pee

809
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:38,664
is when he's peeing.

810
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,628
And how did he find time
to run for president

811
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,798
and then sit in the balcony
and heckle the Muppets? It's a gift.

812
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,722
- But the man has style, yes.
- OK. Who's next?

813
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,058
- The Queen.
- The Queen.

814
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,353
- Oh, I'd like to mount her!
- Jiminy!

815
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:04,690
- You know that she is 92 now, Steve?
- Uh-huh?

816
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:07,401
For her birthday, Prince Charles
gave her an engraved bracelet.

817
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,402
What did it say?

818
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,653
"Do not resuscitate."

819
00:58:12,781 --> 00:58:14,241
- Next!
- Who's next?

820
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,952
Jared and Ivanka.
This is interesting, Jiminy.

821
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,997
Ivanka converted to Judaism
when she married Jared.

822
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:22,708
Haven't the Jews suffered enough?

823
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,050
- But Jared is an interesting dude.
- How?

824
00:58:32,134 --> 00:58:34,553
- He likes surprise sex in the morning.
- Yeah.

825
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,096
So he's gonna love prison.

826
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,230
Who's next?

827
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:48,108
Hillary Clinton.
You know, she's the only woman

828
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,403
who can swear under oath
that she never had sex with Bill Clinton.

829
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,448
Next!

830
00:58:56,116 --> 00:58:57,117
Ted Cruz.

831
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,995
And I thought I had a stick up <i>my </i>ass.

832
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,834
Who's next?

833
00:59:06,835 --> 00:59:08,879
Dave Letterman, our good friend.

834
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,465
I love Dave Letterman!
Here's what I don't get.

835
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:12,674
Dave looks like that,

836
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,551
but you're the one who plays the banjo.

837
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,891
I wonder how long he waited
before eating the other survivors?

838
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:23,852
- Next!
- Let's move on.

839
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,982
Oh, my God,
someone dehydrated Ann Coulter.

840
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,201
No, that's Kellyanne Conway.

841
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,621
Oh! I thought my string cheese
had come to life.

842
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:45,373
Next!

843
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,085
- Kim Jong-un.
- Kim Jong-un.

844
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,755
Gee, he looks like a bouncer
in a lesbian bar, doesn't he?

845
00:59:57,052 --> 01:00:00,639
Someone's making up for his short-range
missile, I'll tell you that much.

846
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,850
Looks like someone put a wig
on a Butterball turkey.

847
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,520
- The man has no style.
- No style? OK.

848
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,771
- No style.
- Who's next?

849
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,067
Oh! I had no idea David Spade
was transitioning.

850
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,073
Next!

851
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:19,991
Oh!

852
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,619
Anderson Cooper looks terrible.

853
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,163
No, that's Mike Pence.

854
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,332
Oh, my! This guy is so white,

855
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,835
he makes you look like
a member of the Wu-Tang Clan.

856
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:35,006
He won't have sex because he's afraid
it will lead to dancing.

857
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,885
You know, Steve, that's his orgasm face.

858
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,178
It's the same thing.

859
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,681
Who's next? Oh!

860
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:44,641
Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

861
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,185
Oh, I loved her as Mrs. Doubtfire.

862
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:54,442
She looks like the "before" person
in an Imodium ad.

863
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,071
Do that again. Really, come on. Jeez!

864
01:00:58,155 --> 01:00:59,281
She looks like the...

865
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:01,199
First of all, you're making me laugh.

866
01:01:01,283 --> 01:01:02,284
Ah!

867
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:05,245
- Just pick me up!
- Come on!

868
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,831
Yeah. Jeez!

869
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,168
- She looks like...
- I don't know!

870
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,255
- Here. For God's sake, let me do it.
- No, don't you do it.

871
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:18,550
Ready? She looks like the "before" person

872
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,010
in an Imodium ad.

873
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,763
- We should not have done it again.
- I know.

874
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:24,973
- But you insisted.
- Yeah.

875
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,559
How is she not named Bertha?
I don't get it.

876
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,729
- Next!
- OK. Who's next?

877
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:35,025
Uh-oh! Looks like the Keebler Elf
ate the inventory.

878
01:01:40,572 --> 01:01:41,948
That is Newt Gingrich.

879
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,993
Oh! Gee, I was getting confused
with Susan Boyle.

880
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,039
I'd be hard-pressed to say

881
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,208
- that dude has style.
- OK. Thank you, Jiminy.

882
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:52,334
Who's next?

883
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:58,048
What a brilliant idea
by President Donald J. Trump.

884
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:02,093
He got Vladimir Putin
riding the border, looking for Mexicans.

885
01:02:06,765 --> 01:02:08,516
All right, Jiminy,
I can't bear this any more.

886
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:10,060
But I have so much more to say!

887
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,021
That's what I'm afraid of.
I'll let you stand on your own two feet.

888
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,814
This is a terrible mistake!

889
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,153
I'll walk. Maybe I'll start running.

890
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:25,450
Oh, boy!

891
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:34,793
Well, ladies and gentlemen, we have come
to the end of our show.

892
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,044
Aww.

893
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,505
Oh, don't worry.
The show is far from over.

894
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:45,262
Your ticket allows you to load the sound
equipment into the van after the show.

895
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,224
Let's bring back Marty,
ladies and gentlemen. Here he comes.

896
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:53,770
Thank you!

897
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:56,731
Marty...

898
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,736
May I say I would not be here
on stage tonight if not for you.

899
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,196
Thank you for driving.

900
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,409
And can I say that this audience

901
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,328
is the greatest audience
that we have ever played.

902
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,998
- I think so.
- You are so generous and fabulous.

903
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,795
We love you like family.
Better than family!

904
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:21,256
- Let's toast them.
- Let's give them a toast.

905
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,133
This is our favorite part of the show.

906
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,219
- Give them a toast, Steve.
- To you, the wonderful audience

907
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:29,139
here in South Carolina. We've had
a great time. Thank you so much.

908
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:30,390
Thank you so much.

909
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,608
Spumante with two Sweet'N Lows.
Just the way I like it.

910
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:44,237
And I'd like to thank
my fabulous musical director,

911
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,281
the talented, the affable,

912
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:49,159
and somewhat limited
Jeff Babko right there.

913
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:52,579
Thank you, Jeffrey!

914
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:58,585
And let's bring back the incredible
Steep Canyon Rangers.

915
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,502
Yeah!

916
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:12,098
You know, Marty, it's the end of our time
here in South Carolina

917
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:15,769
and I woke up this morning
feeling a little sentimental.

918
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:19,856
And you know how I do like to write songs,
that I get inspired once in a while,

919
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:24,277
and I wrote a little tune that kind of...
celebrates our friendship.

920
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,905
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. I wrote some lyrics

921
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,283
and I thought maybe we could do it
tonight. Your lyrics are in black

922
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:33,495
and then I have mine in blue
and I will teach you the melody.

923
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:36,456
Oh, don't worry about that, Steve.
All your melodies sound the same.

924
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:40,168
You wrote this today?

925
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,837
I did, and I gotta say, you know, I...

926
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,924
had a few moments of emotionality,
I thought.

927
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,677
My wife thinks Marty and I are too close,
but we resolved that

928
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:53,056
by getting one of those beds
with the adjustable Sleep Numbers.

929
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:54,474
It does work.

930
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:56,851
Oh, thank you.

931
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:00,438
What's that gotta mic?

932
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:10,407
I mean, I knew you were talented, but...

933
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:14,953
You said, "Top that, motherfucker."

934
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:25,797
OK.

935
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:29,092
- So you wrote this today?
- I did.

936
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,177
- Well, I'm moved.
- Listen to it once.

937
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,095
All right.

938
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,636
- My friend Steve Martin!
- My friend Martin Short!

939
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,354
- Ta-da!
- Thank you.

940
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:48,856
Thank you very much.

941
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,400
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

942
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:52,443
I love this end the best.

943
01:07:52,944 --> 01:07:55,029
- This is my end.
- Thank you all.

944
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:57,991
Very nice. Thank you.

945
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:03,413
I love this end the best!

946
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,622
Thank you.

947
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:06,583
Good night.

948
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,127
Thank you very much.

949
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:14,841
Ta-da!

950
01:08:17,427 --> 01:08:20,013
- Ta-da!
- Thank you. Good night, everybody.

951
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,014
Good night.

952
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:47,582
Thank you so much.

953
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:49,584
Now...

954
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,378
Please be seated.

955
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:55,757
Now, we thought we were done.

956
01:08:56,341 --> 01:09:00,219
But we went offstage and there was
a lawyer from Netflix there,

957
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,723
telling us that we are obligated
to do five more minutes.

958
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:07,685
Contractually.

959
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,730
So I guess this is our encore.

960
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,650
Now, I know there are
varying ticket prices tonight

961
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:16,444
and it never seemed fair to me
that people who paid less

962
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,655
should have the same encore experience...

963
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:22,992
as those who paid more. So if you did
pay less, do the right thing...

964
01:09:23,076 --> 01:09:25,536
Cover one eye or one ear. Hit it, guys.

965
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,004
Oh, well...

966
01:10:22,844 --> 01:10:23,678
What?

967
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:24,846
Dance!

968
01:10:29,267 --> 01:10:30,977
Take it home, Stevie!

969
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,711
Guys, that's five minutes.

970
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,254
- Good night.
- Good night, everybody

971
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,404
Thank you.

972
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,451
Thank you, Steven.

973
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:34,248
Thank you.

974
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,375
Good night, guys.

975
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,504
Thank you all. Good night.
You've been great!

976
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:40,463
Steve.

977
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:44,884
- Good night.
- Good night. Bye-bye.
