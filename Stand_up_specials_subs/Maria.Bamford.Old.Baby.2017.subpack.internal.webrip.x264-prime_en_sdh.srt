1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,219
I always like to tell audiences...

2
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,512
pre-program,

3
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:15,015
just in case you're brought
here by a friend.

4
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,351
Sometimes friends lead us astray.

5
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,978
I had two very close friends.

6
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,689
My parents invite me to go see a film.

7
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,150
I said, "Of course
I'll go see that movie with you,

8
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:26,485
because you love me.

9
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,570
Why on earth would
you want to see me suffer?"

10
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,657
And then I sat through
Steven Spielberg's <i>War Horse,</i>

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,033
which, if you haven't seen,

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,243
as far as I'm concerned,

13
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,495
is a 14-hour, real-time documentary

14
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,831
about a gentle horse struggling in vain

15
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,583
to escape from barbed wire.

16
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,003
This may be your war horse.

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:48,590
<i>If that's the case,</i>

18
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,967
do as I did.

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,927
Take a lap outside.

20
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,220
Get yourself a treat.

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,057
There's probably a CVS
or a Rite Aid selling ice cream... nearby

22
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,476
because you're a good friend.
You took a risk.

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,062
And in fact,
your relationship has only grown deeper,

24
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,439
because now you know
you have different senses of humor

25
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,942
when it comes to certain types
of stand-up comedy.

26
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,653
Oh! What a stinging broth intimacy can be.

27
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,904
[mimics shivering]

28
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,072
That's who you are.

29
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,407
That's it.

30
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,033
Did you know that on Netflix,

31
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,203
it is possible to run out
of genocide documentaries?

32
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,998
And I've got to fill
my queue with something.

33
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,833
How else am I gonna feel that contentment

34
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,116
that comes from the perception

35
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:28,630
I'm not about to kill millions of people,

36
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:32,009
nor are millions
of people about to kill me?

37
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:36,555
My queue kept suggesting a reality show

38
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,682
called <i>Say Yes to the Dress Atlanta,</i>

39
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:43,228
which is a show wherein young ladies
pick out gowns for their nuptials.

40
00:01:43,312 --> 00:01:47,774
And it's very similar
to a genocide documentary,

41
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:51,153
[deep voice] in that no one
is learning from history!

42
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,298
[Southern accent] It's my day,

43
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,907
it's the most important
day in a woman's life.

44
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,870
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

45
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:03,999
[grunts]

46
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,044
[deep low voice]
I just want a pretty dress.

47
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,546
Bigger than the other dresses.

48
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,468
Bigger than the other dresses.

49
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,179
Yep.

50
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:21,725
[snoring]

51
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,356
I just got married last year.

52
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,610
Uh... As an older bride.

53
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,820
What is that, a specter from the attic?

54
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,281
And, uh...

55
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,370
The thing is,

56
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,080
what you might ask, is...

57
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,623
Whoa.

58
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,460
The reason it happened
was I had an epiphany.

59
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,587
I was so sick of myself
asking that question

60
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,214
of people in relationships:

61
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,799
"How did you guys meet?

62
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,552
Did your hands come together
by accident in a garden?"

63
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,181
And what do people
in relationships always say?

64
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,265
They always say,

65
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,852
"Um, well, we just met
and we genuinely liked each other,

66
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,063
and, you know, there's ups and downs.
[chuckles]

67
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,774
We like each other, so we stay together."

68
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:12,818
Oh.

69
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:15,987
Oh, I'm sorry if you're bored

70
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,573
with your miracle!

71
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,203
And it seems like to me romance
takes a lot more than that.

72
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,455
Like, you gotta want it, but no.

73
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,706
Be available.

74
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:27,833
Too busy.

75
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,292
He's the one.

76
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,211
But that's the deal breaker.

77
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,672
The odds of falling in love
with the perfect person

78
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,900
at the perfect time
are about the odds of, I don't know,

79
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,051
being discovered in Hollywood.
Wait a minute.

80
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:42,514
I asked a similarly desperate question
for many years,

81
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,517
which was,
how do you make it in show business?

82
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,271
Do you move to San Diego
and disguise yourself as a bush?

83
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,856
[laughs]

84
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,024
Moving slowly northward

85
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:55,485
beneath the cover of dusk?

86
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,820
[audience laughs]

87
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,740
And what do famous people always say?

88
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,116
They always say,

89
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,909
"Well, do you enjoy doing it?"

90
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:03,994
Great.

91
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,120
Good.

92
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,872
Isn't it fun, yeah, just keep doing it.

93
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,290
Just keep it doing, you know,

94
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:09,624
and, um...

95
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,042
if you don't enjoy it,

96
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,461
please, you know, stop.

97
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,796
But no one can ever
take that away from you.

98
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,257
You get to do it, and it's a privilege.

99
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,592
And just,

100
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,302
you know,

101
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,406
pretty soon you've been
doing it a long time, you go, whoa this,

102
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,473
this is what I do.

103
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:26,391
This is what I've done with my life.

104
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,476
Best of luck.

105
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,102
[laughing]

106
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,521
Which is profoundly true.

107
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,356
Is that what a relationship is?

108
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,651
Is it just continuing
to show up without any guarantee?

109
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,445
I can do that!

110
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,822
I didn't realize there'd be ambiguity,

111
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:42,532
doubt, confusion,

112
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,493
or at least the amount
that there is in a job.

113
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,827
'Cause people always say,

114
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:48,079
once you've been doing
something a long time, they say,

115
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,708
"I bet you always knew
you wanted to be a comedian."

116
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,128
[whispers] I did not want
to do this show today.

117
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,924
You guys know that.

118
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,008
[normal voice] And, uh...

119
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,843
that means me and my boo-boo,

120
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,887
me and my snuggle man,

121
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,766
me and my Mr. Handsome Face Turkey Butt,

122
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,142
have a chance,

123
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,685
because we've had our high times.

124
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,230
Oh, God,
when you're starting out real cocky.

125
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,774
Oh, our kissing is so hot,
it should be on TV.

126
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,484
La, la, la, la...

127
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,237
And then you get the craftsmanship stage.

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,822
That's when things take more effort.

129
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,174
That's when I get a poor attitude,

130
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,032
like in this job.

131
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:28,245
I say, "I'd like to do an invulnerable
impersonation of my mother,

132
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,665
but I don't wanna
do it in front of a sports bar,

133
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:34,251
where the Raisin Bran Bowl is playing

134
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,710
and nobody's listening."

135
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,006
Well, Princess Daffodil,
that would be the whole fucking thing,

136
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:42,842
so why don't you learn
to project above nine television sets

137
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,177
and make some friends?

138
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,762
[audience laughs]

139
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,222
And if you're lucky in life,

140
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,015
you get to have those dark times,

141
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,811
the relationship equivalent
of two weeks in Laughlin, Nevada.

142
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,646
Bombing three shows a night

143
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,147
for hundreds of silent,

144
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,650
angry jet skiers.

145
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,360
Laughing, crying,

146
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,904
thinking, this is not
at all what I wanted!

147
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,700
But there's always one
strawberry toaster pastry left

148
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:08,368
in the hallway vending machine.

149
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,036
And you break it,

150
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,247
and share it with the opener

151
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,165
and the headliner.

152
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,293
[whispers] And you make
it through another show.

153
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,210
[laughs]

154
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,087
And that way you get days like today,

155
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,881
where it all seems
like it was meant to be.

156
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,884
Happy anniversary
to show business audience

157
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,761
of over 20 years.

158
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,930
I love you all far more deeply

159
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:30,724
than the day we first met,

160
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,684
and the fact that we all still have

161
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,437
the free will to abandon each other

162
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,980
at any given moment...

163
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,736
makes it all the more compelling.

164
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,118
I'm back, I came back!

165
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,415
But I don't,

166
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,001
it's my special,
but I don't want to come back,

167
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,252
but I'm coming back!

168
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,920
No, okay, okay.

169
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,214
No, no! No!

170
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,216
But what if I didn't come back?

171
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,468
But I did, I did.

172
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,408
That's full body peek-a-boo.
Not a lot of comics who are doing that.

173
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,184
[audience laughing]

174
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,356
Oh!

175
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,232
[chatters]

176
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,028
You're right.

177
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,196
Um...

178
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,322
[blows raspberry]

179
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,865
[chatters]

180
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,533
I know.

181
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,035
I'm 46 years-old.

182
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,579
Of course I've fallen in love
many times before.

183
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,457
It was always over 100% my fault,

184
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,293
uh, that it didn't work out,
'cause you know how it is.

185
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:42,629
You fall in love with someone.
You tell them, uh,

186
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,714
that you love them,
and then you share with them

187
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,132
what you think

188
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,469
is the single most horrifying
fact about yourself.

189
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,152
They're gonna think it's something else.

190
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,222
But...

191
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,183
For example, I would tell you,
I love you so much.

192
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,727
Heads up:
mental illness runs in my family.

193
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,145
If ever I start talking too fast

194
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:01,022
about wanting to get in touch
with the pope

195
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,774
or some other ethical authority,

196
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,609
you're gonna wanna put me in a purple van,

197
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,821
drive me to doggy day care 'cause
I need to be boarded for the weekend.

198
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,573
Some guys said,

199
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,367
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

200
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,493
Fair enough.

201
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:14,619
And some guys were like,

202
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,121
"Oh, okay."

203
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,331
And I rejected them.

204
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,419
They shared with me their deepest secret,

205
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,379
and one fantastic

206
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,297
human being to share with me.

207
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:27,632
Babe, I love you,

208
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,135
and... I think you should know,

209
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,678
my dad's in the mafia.

210
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:35,181
I'm not, but I do have a million
in cash in case something goes down.

211
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,225
He uses my Social Security number.

212
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,185
He will probably try to use yours,

213
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:41,187
but it'll never be a problem."

214
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:46,943
What I said was, "Whoa, whoa, whoa."

215
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,737
What I could have said was,

216
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,990
"I work in the entertainment industry.

217
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,743
I am awash in filthy money!"

218
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:58,955
The Disney Channel's a front
for Thai child prostitution.

219
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,332
That's an open secret.

220
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,500
I've...

221
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,630
I've paid in cash most nights
with a gun on the table.

222
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,260
I would be honored
if your father used my Social,

223
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:15,343
and at certain points in my life,
it would have only raised my credit score.

224
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,723
[laughing]

225
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,434
I had another, uh,

226
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,894
handsome individual

227
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,354
share with me,

228
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,356
"Babe, a couple years back,

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,776
I had a two-year,
meth-fueled gay relationship,

230
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:29,360
but then I got into Weight Watchers,

231
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,945
and I gained back my confidence."

232
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,949
What I said, very judgmentally, was...

233
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,785
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."

234
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,703
What I could have said was,

235
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,164
"That sounds like fun!"

236
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,042
Life is fucking hard.

237
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,835
I hope you make up for it in points.

238
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,462
And...

239
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,839
if you want to talk about
bizarre sexual behavior,

240
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,592
I for a period of 15 years

241
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,804
had a one night stand
in a Hampton Inn or better

242
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:59,015
up and down the I-35W corridor.

243
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,433
They were always drunk,

244
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,435
I was always stone-cold sober.

245
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,437
It was planned, it was cyclical.

246
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,398
Those are a few of
the signs of a predator.

247
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,817
Nobody's perfect.

248
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,026
Let's work this out!

249
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,361
[laughing]

250
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,988
So when my scrumptious beloved...

251
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,324
explained to me that at the age of 52

252
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,034
he is not, in fact, a virgin,

253
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,453
and I had always dreamed
of having a clean boy...

254
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,122
[audience laughs]

255
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,207
but he is a filthy little monkey.

256
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,919
And he was okay with me.

257
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,755
He said, "I know sometimes
women who are post-menopausal...

258
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,800
Um, well, anyways,
if you go to the psych ward,

259
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,319
they don't let you have sharp stuff.

260
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,761
And if-if you grew a beard,

261
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:38,471
I'd come in and I'd shave your beard."

262
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,931
[audience laughs]

263
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:47,897
That's about the most
romantic thing I ever did hear tell!

264
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,359
[laughing]

265
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,696
Merch!

266
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,365
Merch!

267
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,449
Anybody?

268
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,576
Hi.

269
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,161
Uh, you interested in some merch?

270
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,164
Uh, we take, uh, cash,
we take credit cards.

271
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,790
We, uh, take barter.

272
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,376
Um, that's a safe dating card.

273
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,461
It takes you through the stages of dating,

274
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,381
all the way through rape
and domestic violence.

275
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,216
You don't have any CDs or anything?

276
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,179
Uh, I do not sell any CDs
of my stand-up comedy.

277
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:23,224
I know... I bought this already,

278
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,517
because it's my own merch,

279
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,437
but wouldn't I be interested
in having a little more?

280
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,563
Hmm?

281
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,440
'Cause what if I gave this one away?

282
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,026
The signature, I'm hiding hat.

283
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,194
And then I would need another.

284
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,698
These are perfect for the athletic in you.

285
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,033
[man] Jesus Christ!

286
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,201
Um, this is an XXL.

287
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,120
You think, that would be too big on me,

288
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,247
but is it not just maybe perfect?

289
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,332
The perfect size.

290
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,251
If you want a conversation starter,

291
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,003
you know, and you say,

292
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,713
okay, I wanna wear a big short

293
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,798
that's gonna make people ask questions,

294
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,885
but then also acknowledge my limitations

295
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,678
as a personality,

296
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:04,098
so that, when you abruptly walk away,

297
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:05,433
look down,

298
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,226
they're not surprised.

299
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,654
"Oh, do you wanna be happy?"
"Yes."

300
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,489
"Do you wanna be a success?"
"Yes."

301
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,240
"Do you wanna buy merch?"
"Yes!"

302
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,368
I just tricked you there.

303
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:26,079
It's a pancake stress squeezer,

304
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,414
um, and then it reads, which is very true,

305
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,749
"Meds are more effective."

306
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,501
[audience laughs]

307
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,336
More merch available pencil.

308
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,296
I already want 100.

309
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,923
Wait a minute, I bought 100!

310
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,677
My husband has noticed, uh,
something about me.

311
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,055
I like to tear open packages of food,

312
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:47,392
take caps partially off beverages,

313
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,728
and then leave them out and around,

314
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,897
and he said very kindly, very sweetly,

315
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,941
"Why?"

316
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,067
[laughing]

317
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,070
I explained, because I am raccoon.

318
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:03,032
I need to get in there, okay,

319
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,409
get what's good,

320
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,994
be on my way.

321
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,663
Oh, but what if you get sick,

322
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,207
you know, because sometimes it can go bad?

323
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,458
You'll fall ill.

324
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,252
Were you not listening

325
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,671
when I just mentioned that I am raccoon?

326
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,716
I can digest ceiling tile.

327
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,301
I just need to fill this up,

328
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,178
get back to the river with my friends.

329

but we got this still going.

492
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,247
Whenever I walk past a cemetery,
I like to say,

493
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:27,500
"What happened?"

494
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,210
[audience laughing]

495
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,965
Wow.

496
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,010
That way, the next time
you let somebody down

497
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,845
like I'm letting you guys down right now,

498
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,390
there are not nearly enough
punch lines per second.

499
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,266
Jesus, what is this, a speech?

500
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,895
Yeah, and then after the show

501
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,231
she gives these shoulder-based hugs.

502
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,607
Does she even give a shit?

503
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,025
[audience laughing]

504
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,611
Well, why don't you click on my...

505
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,530
my new Snapchat story?

506
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,075
[whispers] I love you,

507
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,370
but I have glasses and a big mustache.

508
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,080
Rainbow vomit.

509
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,832
I love you.

510
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,710
Glasses, mustache, rainbow vomit.

511
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,586
I love you.

512
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,422
Glasses, mustache,

513
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,340
rainbow vomit.

514
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,345
I have a friend who's always
trying to get me to do stuff.

515
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,514
You want to go horseback riding?

516
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:25,850
What is it?

517
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,811
You go on a dusty trail with two lesbians

518
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,396
who used to be a couple,

519
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,940
but now they run
a small business together.

520
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,067
And horses bite.

521
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,986
[audience laughs]

522
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,572
Okay, I'll go once,

523
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,699
but I'm gonna have
to cry all the way there,

524
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:45,161
and I'm gonna need
a Dairy Queen peanut buster parfait

525
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,537
on the way back.

526
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,539
And that's hot fudge, peanuts, ice cream,

527
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,082
hot fudge, peanuts, ice cream,

528
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,667
hot fudge, peanuts, ice cream,

529
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,961
whip cream, cherry topper.

530
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,921
And what I do is I go for the eye,

531
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:58,340
'cause it takes the fight right out of it!

532
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,467
[laughing]

533
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,140
Do you wanna go swing dancing?

534
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,517
Are people still doing that?

535
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,271
The war is over!

536
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,483
There's plenty of pantyhose for everyone.

537
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:19,570
It's every Sunday from 2:00 to 4:00,

538
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,989
just when you don't wanna do anything.

539
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,201
And it's side, side,
back step, side, side.

540
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,577
I'll go for three years,

541
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,120
but that is it!

542
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,874
Turns out it's pretty fun.

543
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,586
Do you wanna go to a fitness boot camp?

544
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,421
It's every day at 6:00 a.m.

545
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:39,757
'cause they're making us into a shape,

546
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,759
and you run

547
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,886
and there's no game element

548
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,679
to distract you from the fact

549
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:49,558
that you keep running and running.

550
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,560
Here's what I'm gonna do.

551
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,895
I'm gonna go for five days.

552
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,772
Day five, Tanya,

553
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,816
and I know it's gonna be Tanya,

554
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:57,983
is gonna say,

555
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,151
"Come on, Maria!

556
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:00,694
I wanna see you push it!"

557
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,782
And I am never gonna go again.

558
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,328
But will you forget
to cancel the automatic debit

559
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,163
coming from your checking account

560
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,041
and pay for it
for the next year and a half?

561
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,543
[whispers] Of course I will.

562
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,336
[laughing]

563
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,880
I love you so much.

564
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:25,094
Uh, I'm not very good with chit-chat.

565
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,930
Uh, I like a structured communication,

566
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,932
a la stand-up, you know?

567
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,725
I like a hard out.

568
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,312
You know, chit, chat,

569
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:37,189
chit, chat.

570
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,024
Ugh.

571
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,776
Chit chat...

572
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,945
Where are we going with this?

573
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,532
There is a guy at my dog park

574
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,992
who does not have a dog.

575
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,159
And, um...

576
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,578
[audience laughs]

577
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,705
You're a very beautiful woman.

578
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,831
Hmm, keep it coming.

579
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,040
Turns out I do have all day.

580
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:01,255
Uh, Howard's 85 years-old
and he used to be a dog trainer.

581
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,091
[mans voice] You know,
these dogs you have,

582
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,174
they don't know the difference
between good and bad

583
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,305
the same way people don't know
the difference between good and bad.

584
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,058
The happiest days of my life,

585
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:14,351
I was five years old,

586
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:16,186
I was riding on my father's shoulders,

587
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,646
Times Square,

588
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,648
end of World War II, V-Day.

589
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,150
The war was over, but...

590
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,110
you know, at that same moment

591
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,488
the atomic bomb was being dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

592
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,865
where millions died.

593
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,951
So was it good or was it bad?

594
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,412
[audience laughs]

595
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,292
[normal voice] Okay, this makes much
more sense than clicker training.

596
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,585
We will sit,

597
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,919
and we will stay,

598
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,480
which is not a problem for our family,

599
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,965
because, uh,
everyone's brought in a wagon.

600
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,051
We've got two elderly, overweight pugs.

601
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,135
Nobody walks.

602
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,095
Uh, just out to get some air.

603
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,474
And, you know, Howard's trying
to get me to teach the dogs something.

604
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,309
You gotta give them consequences.

605
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,979
Howard, we're keeping them alive.

606
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,359
Uh... Is that not cruelty enough?

607
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,865
Well, you know, if I asked you,

608
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,242
hey, would you raise
your right hand for me,

609
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,912
you'd say, fuck you, Howard.
I don't know you.

610
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,413
Oh, sounds like you do know me.

611
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,792
But if I dug you underground,

612
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,877
put you underground for six months,

613
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,505
no light, no sound, no human contact,

614
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,924
and then I brought you back up

615
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,968
and I said, "Now, will you
raise your right hand for me?

616
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,178
[scoffs]

617
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,971
You're gonna raise your right hand.

618
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,392
[sniffs]

619
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,103
Point of order.

620
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,187
Our, uh...

621
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,232
Our family,
I don't know if you've been there,

622
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,276
but you know when you
fucked up in life in a major way,

623
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,195
and you look around and you think,

624
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,656
I have just enough people who love me.

625
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,325
Even if I continued to fuck up

626
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,619
in kind of a major way on a regular basis,

627
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,330
I'm still gonna get treats.

628
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,249
Why strive

629
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,711
for some imaginary standard of behavior?

630
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,046
Even if some of us,
and I'm not gonna say who...

631
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,131
It's me!

632
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,799
Shit on the carpet,

633
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:11,427
sometimes three times a day,

634
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,929
I can't make it to the toity,

635
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,557
Papa's still gonna helicopter us

636
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,643
into the-the bed for snuggles.

637
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,145
[laughing]

638
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,939
We had a great dog named Trixie.

639
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,525
We called her Trixie
'cause she could do so many tricks.

640
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,986
Jesus Christ, we're not idiots, Howard!

641
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,574
Of course her name was Trixie
'cause she'd...

642
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,828
Sadly, Shaq is always
a Rottweiler in a Lakers jersey.

643
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,414
Pancake is a white, overweight guinea pig.

644
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,791
These things remain true over time!

645
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,418
[audience laughs]

646
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,880
She was a great dog.

647
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,066
The only problem was
she couldn't stop licking herself,

648
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,176
touching herself.
With us guys, it's one and done,

649
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,762
but with you ladies
there's no reason to stop, you know?

650
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,473
And, uh,
we would throw tennis balls at us,

651
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,308
spray orange juice in her face.

652
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,934
We got her this buzzer collar.

653
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,186
That just made it worse.

654
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,645
[audience laughs]

655
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,399
Yeah, our, uh,

656
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,401
Betty,

657
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,820
our pug Betty, she, uh,

658
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,072
she loops her leg around Arnold's head

659
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,616
and forces him into a position

660
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,493
of cunnilingus...

661
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,120
for hours.

662
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:22,706
Uh, we call it The Cherry Picker.

663
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,291
[laughing]

664
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:29,254
That's when I think our animals
have so much to teach us.

665
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,842
[singing in French]

666
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,766
All right.

667
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,727
Okay, merch door open, open!

668
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,979
Come on in! Uh...

669
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,607
I'm changing into
a more professional voice

670
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,484
so that you'll feel more comfortable

671
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:52,277
exchanging money and credit.

672
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,821
Hey, come on by.

673
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,155
Uh...

674
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,990
We have the T-shirt,

675
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,909
uh, the one that I'm wearing, as well.

676
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,494
All sorts of sizes.

677
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,746
They run big because
they are made in America.

678
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,081
Uh, and they are, uh,

679
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,165
union,

680
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,250
union made.

681
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,169
Everything else made in Indochina.

682
00:27:09,253 --> 00:27:11,505
Now these are, they're such good quality.

683
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,048
Uh, they're fresh.

684
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,176
It's so easy to, it's so easy...

685
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:19,888
Okay, it's not as easy as I thought.

686
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,892
Um, I don't want you to feel pressure
to buy anything either.

687
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,096
If you need that pen, you...

688
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,978
You can have it.

689
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,729
I can have it? Okay, okay!

690
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:31,775
I've lived in Los Angeles, uh, so long

691
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,194
that I've become violently positive.

692
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:37,030
I am aggressively optimistic.

693
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,658
I was, um, [clicks tongue]

694
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,952
talking to a lady in a shop,

695
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,495
and she said,

696
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,164
"I've always wanted to open
a little boutique like this,

697
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,083
but just like a gourmet deli!"

698
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,668
[audience laughs]

699
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,836
Dude,

700
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,421
it's already started happening.

701
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,547
You just, you say,

702
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,757
"I am now a grocer.

703
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,260
I am now purveying cookies,

704
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,512
candies, cakes, cornucopias.

705
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:01,597
I am now."

706
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,849
Yeah, I have two kids, a full-time job.

707
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,517
That'd be pretty tough.

708
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,019
I know it seems impossible,

709
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,730
but it is insane how much
the universe supports you!

710
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,440
Pretty soon you'll be like,

711
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,191
oh, my God, there's a warehouse.

712
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:14,460
And then like somebody's like,

713
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:16,528
I've got a free crate of tuna
you could have!

714
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,696
And then...

715
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,698
I'm your first customer.

716
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,782
[deep voice] Hello!

717
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:21,992
Is the beef fresh?

718
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,678
[normal voice]
This is so powerful if you act it out.

719
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,942
[deep voice] Is the beef fresh?

720
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:26,914
Is it fresh?

721
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:27,915
Um...

722
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,291
Is it fresh?

723
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,792
[audience laughs]

724
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:34,338
Um, you know what? It's actually, uh...

725
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,089
[grunts]

726
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:37,716
[audience laughs]

727
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,527
Probably when I think about it,

728
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,362
it was probably just something
I was just saying.

729
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,262
[laughs nervously]

730
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,848
I probably wouldn't necessarily

731
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,892
want to get into retail.

732
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,149
Open up your fucking

733
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,901
[yells] shop!

734
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,278
[audience laughing]

735
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:02,658
Make real every passing fancy!

736
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,037
My beloved husband is, of course,

737
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,290
bearing the brunt
of this unsolicited support.

738
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,917
We were talking about Diana Nyad.

739
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,336
She swam from Cuba to Florida,

740
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,463
a 1,000 miles, open water,

741
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,923
without a shark cage.

742
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:20,467
He said, "Oh, I could never do that!"

743
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:23,178
I said,

744
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:26,598
"Yes, you can!"

745
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:27,599
[laughs]

746
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,725
Maria,

747
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,977
she's an Olympic swimmer.

748
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,270
She attempted five times.

749
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,896
She almost died twice.

750
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,439
I'm not a good swimmer.

751
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,109
I also really don't want to do it.

752
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,694
[audience laughs]

753
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,114
Why don't you believe in yourself?

754
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,826
We would just incrementally increase

755
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,828
the time you spend in the tub!

756
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,121
[laughing]

757
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,166
I-I'd nip you with washcloths

758
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,545
to mimic the sting of the box jelly.

759
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,009
I was wondering
why I was getting so enraged

760
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,885
when someone suggested there are limits,

761
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,178
and, um,

762
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,390
it is because I think
I feel terribly guilty

763
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,642
that all my dreams
came true relatively easily

764
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,811
about 15 years ago.

765
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,730
I just wanted to be on television.

766
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,731
It happened.

767
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,317
I'd like to think that,
that was a result of hard work.

768
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,484
But if you know me at all,

769
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:22,070
you know that I am sleepy
and I cannot remember

770
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:23,447
what you just told me.

771
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,116
That leaves luck.

772
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,743
Luck is just another of way of saying,

773
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,910
some of us were born

774
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,495
sliding into home plate.

775
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,873
Uh, I was given a full ride scholarship

776
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,084
through the age of 25
by an organization called

777
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,961
The Bamfords!

778
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,045
[laughs]

779
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,383
I was talking to a group
of high school students,

780
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,261
and none of us knew why I was there.

781
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,013
Very confusing,

782
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,307
not a little frightening.

783
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,727
I was saying something
extremely ill-advised,

784
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,898
like, "You could do anything
you set your mind to, turtles!"

785
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,610
Kid in the back said,

786
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,487
"Um,

787
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,197
it's not that easy."

788
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:07,741
[frightened panting]

789
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,242
[audience laughs]

790
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:12,079
As a final lesson for Career Day,

791
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,706
if you could take
one of my head shots from 1999

792
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,376
of which I ordered 1,000 on rush

793
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,920
and have never needed them,

794
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,172
and if you guys could toss those out,

795
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,590
I can't seem to.

796
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,258
And as you say to yourself,

797
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:27,344
"Huh?

798
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,262
Who was that even?

799
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:32,099
I don't even want to be what she is.

800
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:34,142
It's like,

801
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,477
she's all shaky."

802
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,480
How does she even have a job?

803
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:40,899
[audience laughing]

804
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,238
Just know what one individual

805
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,656
managed to accomplish

806
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,658
with a modicum of effort...

807
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,871
and every possible advantage.

808
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:55,997
[laughs]

809
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,334
"She's like an old baby."

810
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:00,627
Yes!

811
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,087
[audience laughs]

812
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:05,382
That is the perfect description
of what I am.

813
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,260
Very old,

814
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,678
and baby-like.

815
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,887
[audience laughs]

816
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,890
Was getting older.

817
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,600
I am still getting older.

818
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,269
Heard a colleague say,

819
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,187
"Whoa, she's really let herself go!"

820
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,523
And I just felt elated.

821
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,234
uh, 'cause that... is my plan.

822
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,236
I'm going full Detroit,

823
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,448
abandoning all infrastructure,

824
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,659
letting my neural pathways

825
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,828
grow slack with disuse.

826
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,540
People used to come here.

827
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,711
Oh!

828
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,089
She's so pretty.

829
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,174
She's...

830
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,259
She's so pretty in the moonlight.

831
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,344
[audience laughs]

832
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,555
She's just a little girl.

833
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,186
But the disgust in that man's voice, uh,

834
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:00,479
you know, like, God,

835
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:01,980
is it my civic duty?

836
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,566
Do I need to keep myself
looking tight, puffy, and wet...

837
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,694
in order to not bring down
the property value

838
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,404
of the person I'm standing next to?

839
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,158
And then I thought about Los Angeles.

840
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,494
We have 100,000 people
living on the streets.

841
00:33:16,203 --> 00:33:17,621
We need more of me.

842
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,251
More places where you can take
the emotional equivalent

843
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,462
of a shopping cart
full of dead car batteries

844
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,339
and pull it up.

845
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,424
I'm a very good place to squat.

846
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,426
I cannot provide you any services,

847
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,887
but...

848
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,640
if you're at a party,

849
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,850
or you stand around, don't feel welcome,

850
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,560
come sit next to me.

851
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,523
I can be a shelter from the storm.

852
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,941
[audience laughs]

853
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,953
Uh, I like my job, but sometimes I lie

854
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,871
about what I do, uh...

855
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:03,833
because, uh, sometimes I say
I'm a bookkeeper, you know?

856
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,544
If I'm in a closed space.

857
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:06,753
I wish I am.

858
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,838
I do all my own Quicken and QuickBooks.

859
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:11,550
I have also been audited by the IRS

860
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:13,677
five times!

861
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,637
Turns out they owed me $25!

862
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,055
Ka-blam!

863
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,473
Uh...

864
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,475
'Cause I may be eccentric,

865
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,310
but I save my receipts in a bucket.

866
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,396
And, um...

867
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,441
the reason I say that, uh,
I'm a bookkeeper

868
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,571
is because one time I was on a flight
from Los Angeles to New York,

869
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,990
and a woman said,

870
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,616
what do you do, what I did.

871
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,036
And she went into a PTSD
stream of consciousness

872
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:42,747
traumatic monologue

873
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,250
about the worst experience I've...

874
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:49,129
The night... when my husband,

875
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,007
we were in the front row of a comedy show,

876
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,383
and the comedian,

877
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,761
it was an hour and no, no laughs.

878
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:58,722
He was bombing, and,

879
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,599
you know what? We couldn't leave.

880
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:03,018
And it was so painful.

881
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,352
It was...

882
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,979
weird and...

883
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,066
I will never go see stand-up comedy ever.

884
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,736
[audience laughs]

885
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:17,699
Well, we apologize that
you experienced that with our services.

886
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,118
If there's any way we can
win back your business,

887
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,787
in fact, I'd love to get your e-mail
address and your birthday

888
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,540
and set you up with 20 free tickets
to a comedy show!

889
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,753
As it turns out, for the most part,

890
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,129
as you all know,

891
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:32,881
comedy tickets are...

892
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:33,965
free.

893
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:38,261
I then very defensively asked her

894
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:40,221
what she did for a living.

895
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,057
She then explained
that she was an employee

896
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,310
of a little Canadian corporation
called Cirque du Soleil

897
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,521
as a fucking clown.

898
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,317
Now I,

899
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,944
of course, have dated a clown before.

900
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,029
[audience laughs]

901
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,783
And I sat through six performances

902
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,160
of a clown as a Christ figure.

903
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,413
Crucified clown Christ.

904
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,581
Red rubber nose,

905
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,000
audience armed with water balloons,

906
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:11,503
asked to fling them at said clown Christ

907
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,546
while screaming, "Jew!"

908
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:17,092
If you want to talk about

909
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,552
the deep discomfort of the arts,

910
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:20,762
dive in.

911
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,555
[laughing]

912
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,307
I wish I had paid to see that show.

913
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,561
But I was always on the guest list.

914
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,943
Uh, I had to take a break from work
'cause, uh, I went mental.

915
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,611
And, uh...

916
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:39,030
my friend told me,
hey, you're talking a little too fast,

917
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,740
having a lot of shit ideas.

918
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,784
Uh, why don't you get in my Ford Flex,

919
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,995
and I'll, uh, motor you over
to the public storage.

920
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:48,957
And, uh...

921
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,209
I went into a psychiatric facility,

922
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,461
which, if you haven't been, uh,

923
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,380
don't feel bad if you go,

924
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,548
and, uh...

925
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,551
they're uniformly awful.

926
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,469
You're not at the wrong one.

927
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,638
They're all bad, they're all bad.

928
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:04,931
Uh... [laughs]

929
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,100
It's as if an art director
came in and said,

930
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,436
"Okay, I want to break five more chairs,

931
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,895
and then we need...

932
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,357
uh, at least three pieces
taken out of every puzzle.

933
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,192
And...

934
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:17,318
the big screen TV,

935
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:20,572
let's have it playing
Ultimate Fighting Championships

936
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,198
at maximum volume,

937
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,575
lose the remote."

938
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,951
[laughing]

939
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,580
They sat me down with the-the psych guy,

940
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,343
and he said, you know,
the usual questions.

941
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,833
"Why are you here?"

942
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,835
Oh, I have...

943
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,129
explicit plans to kill myself.

944
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,422
"Okay, great."

945
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,423
Uh,

946
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,591
pretty common.

947
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:42,635
"What, uh, are the circumstances?"

948
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,888
Every moment is unbearable.

949
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,291
"Uh, what kind of work do you do?"

950
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:49,768
[groans]

951
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,103
I'm a comedian.

952
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,022
No response.

953
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,940
Felt... so relieved.

954
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:59,819
And he went back to his little laptop, um,
and some music came out of it,

955
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:03,656
and I was like, well that's kind of weird.
Uh, but I get it, uh...

956
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,326
A lot of times,
in the light booth right now actually

957
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,995
I have a little, uh,
Wimp video playing a baby tortoise

958
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,580
trying to eat a raspberry.

959
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,081
And it's just so,

960
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:13,625
when at work when I get bored,

961
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,960
[laughs]

962
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,088
I have something to cheer me up.

963
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,383
[audience laughs]

964
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,928
It doesn't affect my performance at all.

965
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,513
Um...

966
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:28,056
He turned the laptop around,

967
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,724
and he said, is this you?

968
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,143
And I said, yes, clearly it's me,

969
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:33,853
with more make-up and better material.

970
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,146
And, uh...

971
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,981
he said, "I had to YouTube you

972
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,901
because I was concerned
that you were delusional."

973
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,612
Since when is it grandiose psychosis

974
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,781
to claim that in any way you're involved

975
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,699
in the entertainment industry?

976
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:48,952
It is simple courtesy to wait

977
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,496
until someone has left
the room to IMDb them.

978
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,580
[audience laughs]

979
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:56,167
And it's not like I said
I was Richard Pryor.

980
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,338
And had I claimed to be

981
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,550
one of the finest comedians
of our past century

982
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,343
and been able to perform anything

983
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,221
from his quintessential 1979

984
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,640
Long Beach stand-up special,

985
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:11,724
or,

986
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,434
perhaps, more weirdly,

987
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,145
uh, been able to quote
some of his lesser-known material

988
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:19,440
about the difference between
beating white women and black women.

989
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,525
Uh,

990
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,402
doesn't age well.

991
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,112
[laughing]

992
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,656
But the joke was on me,

993
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,534
uh, because, uh, the psychiatrist
then put me on a mood stabilizer

994
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,078
whose primary side effects are cognitive,

995
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,999
making it almost impossible
to think or talk.

996
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,458
Ho on!

997
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,545
Or should I say, "Oh no."

998
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,422
[audience laughs]

999
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,715
Yeah.

1000
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,760
Seventy two hours later,
you know how it is, you've gotta work.

1001
00:39:47,844 --> 00:39:49,596
Oh, God, get back to work.

1002
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,055
I'm working on stuff.

1003
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,409
I'm really doing the inner work
so I can get back and get,

1004
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,601
get back to work.

1005
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,103
I found myself
in downtown Chicago, bleeding.

1006
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,188
I had lost all my identification

1007
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,857
and was making this noise.

1008
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,692
[vocalizes] Ah.

1009
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,195
I called my mother and said,

1010
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,113
[gurgles]

1011
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,281
She...

1012
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:09,824
[exhales]

1013
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,868
[audience laughing and clapping]

1014
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:15,038
She said, "Honey, somehow,
you know what?

1015
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,332
Somehow get to the airport,

1016
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,668
tell... Go to Delta Priority.

1017
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,588
Tell them you are gold medallion!"

1018
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,672
[audience laughs]

1019
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:29,211
I did what my mother told me,

1020
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,303
and it turns out, uh,

1021
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,722
points is not a bad form of health-care.

1022
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,015
[laughing]

1023
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,224
Got an upgrade.

1024
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,936
Uh... I was bleeding and crying,

1025
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,812
but a lot of leg room.

1026
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,648
Merch for sale.

1027
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,734
Mer... Merch for...

1028
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,862
Merch for sale!

1029
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,324
Hi, guys.

1030
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,451
Selling, um, some items.

1031
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,871
I don't want to force you into anything.
Whatever's within your budget.

1032
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,415
All the money goes, uh, to support

1033
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,376
uh, the psychiatric hospital

1034
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,586
that is in my hometown, Miller-Dwan.

1035
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,214
My mom's stayed there and worked there.

1036
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,924
And this is a pencil

1037
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,634
that has hope on this side.

1038
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,969
There's the words "Hope"

1039
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,137
so you can grind down "Hope",

1040
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,307
very slowly.

1041
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,642
[audience laughing]

1042
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,938
And at the bottom it says,

1043
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,648
"More merch available."

1044
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,192
Look at that, that looks perfect on you.

1045
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,610
- It works.
- You know what?

1046
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,404
It's... Everything's free.

1047
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,613
Everything's free.

1048
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,573
I can't, I can't charge these people.

1049
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,617
Just take it, take it, take it.

1050
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,244
Take it. It's-it's all yours.

1051
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,037
And thank you for coming to the show.

1052
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:39,414
We've raised a dollar.

1053
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,082
Every dollar counts.

1054
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,335
That dollar might go towards

1055
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,671
a packet of graham crackers that,

1056
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,798
you know, they wouldn't have had.

1057
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:52,468
I finally got back to work
about a year and a half later, [chuckles]

1058
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,554
and everybody was really nice about it,

1059
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:55,638
uh, coming back.

1060
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,181
But I had one coworker say,

1061
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,809
"Hey, Bamford.

1062
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:01,436
Heard about what happened in Chicago.

1063
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,187
Oh, man. Jeez"

1064
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,231
Yeah, it wasn't cool.

1065
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,233
I had to cancel-cancel like six shows.

1066
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,402
I-I still owe them a lot of money.

1067
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,486
I'm on, I'm on...

1068
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:11,738
a payment plan.

1069
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:14,699
Yeah, I've never bailed on a show.

1070
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:18,494
I had a temperature of 495 degrees.

1071
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,747
I was the temperature
of a fully charred pork chop.

1072
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,665
[audience laughs]

1073
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,209
But I did my 90-minute set,

1074
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,086
then I lost control of my bowels.

1075
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:31,507
That's awesome, man.

1076
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,717
Good for you.

1077
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,552
I just wasn't able to think or talk,

1078
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,846
and I thought that might
not be as funny as I'd hoped.

1079
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,347
[audience laughing]

1080
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,768
Yeah, comedy's gotta be funny.

1081
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,437
[audience laughing]

1082
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:49,275
And it's gotta be funny to everybody,
you know?

1083
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,527
If it's not funny,

1084
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,571
it's not comedy.

1085
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,697
[audience laughs]

1086
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,075
And I test my shit out.

1087
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,493
I went to China this year.

1088
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,745
I was not welcome.
I did not have a Visa.

1089
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:03,873
But I worked it out,

1090
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,709
and now I have a tight hour
of chopstick impersonations.

1091
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,419
I do kitty cat, bunny,

1092
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,130
uh, walrus, llama.

1093
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,800
You know, I could do a ten city tour

1094
00:43:13,883 --> 00:43:16,052
of the Gansu province if need be.

1095
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:19,889
That's awesome, man.

1096
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,059
So you never get scared of performing
outside of certain groups or anything?

1097
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,186
No, no.

1098
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,605
I just did a pop-up open mic
at a live birth.

1099
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,315
[audience laughs]

1100
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,237
You know, Mom's distracted,

1101
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,571
but just to be there.

1102
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:37,698
You know, for baby's first laugh.

1103
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:39,075
[audience laughs]

1104
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,202
And, uh, actually,

1105
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:43,412
somebody's been using one
of my closing bits

1106
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,997
that I use for younger crowds.

1107
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:46,374
And it really pissed me off,

1108
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,334
because I've been doing
it since the early 90's

1109
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,460
and I got tape on it.

1110
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,546
If you see anybody doing it,

1111
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,840
if you could tell them
to cease and desist.

1112
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,051
It's...

1113
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,055
[audience laughs]

1114
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,399
Oh, shit, peek-a-boo is yours?

1115
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:15,987
Man.

1116
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,071
Yeah.

1117
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,533
You know, basically I decided to copyright

1118
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,201
the entire human experience.

1119
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:25,705
That's awesome, man.

1120
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,541
I guess I just... I just don't...

1121
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,793
I don't have that ambition in me anymore.

1122
00:44:30,877 --> 00:44:32,587
I don't know if it's the meds, but...

1123
00:44:33,546 --> 00:44:35,423
Like even before tonight's show,

1124
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,844
I stared into the reflection
of my Diet Coke tallboy.

1125
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,679
[audience laughing]

1126
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,932
And I said, "Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1127
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:47,476
Hey, kid.

1128
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,687
I wanna see 20 percent,

1129
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,148
if not five.

1130
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,608
[audience laughs]

1131
00:44:54,984 --> 00:44:56,277
'Cause you know what?

1132
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,029
So what?

1133
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,614
Who cares?

1134
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,658
It doesn't even fucking matter."

1135
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:04,201
[audience laughs]

1136
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,704
[rapidly gulping]

1137
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,834
[gulping continues]

1138
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,377
[laughing]

1139
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:17,298
I was so scared of going
into a psychiatric institution,

1140
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,508
I thought, what if somebody finds out?

1141
00:45:19,592 --> 00:45:23,554
Uh, this is what happened
if somebody finds out.

1142
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,056
I was in there,

1143
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,807
and, um, somebody came up and said,

1144
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:28,893
"Hi,

1145
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,770
I'm one of the therapists here.

1146
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,772
Um. I know you.

1147
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:36,734
Not personally,
but we have a friend in common,

1148
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,110
Joe De La Rosa?

1149
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:39,987
He's a comic out of New Jersey.

1150
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,447
He's fantastic.

1151
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,616
He does The Laugh Factory,
The Comedy Store.

1152
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,077
I've never seen you there.
They're great clubs.

1153
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,121
Have you ever tried to get in on there?

1154
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,623
'Cause it just seems like,

1155
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,668
there's just great crowds.

1156
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,086
But, um...

1157
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:58,047
anyways, I just,
I wanted to let you know

1158
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:01,008
that this is totally confidential,

1159
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:02,718
and I would never tell anyone."

1160
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,269
Oh.

1161
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:16,524
I'm in a county-stamped gown

1162
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,944
and a pair of electric green gripper socks

1163
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,654
that are not my own.

1164
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:27,159
You tell whoever the fuck you want.

1165
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,124
[cheering]

1166
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,130
Because all is lost.

1167
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,589
[audience laughing]

1168
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:45,428
I had a dream come true, uh,

1169
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,139
which I-I couldn't believe it.

1170
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,267
Show business came to my
hometown of Duluth, Minnesota

1171
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,978
and said the kinds of things

1172
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,147
that show business does,

1173
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,481
things like,

1174
00:46:57,565 --> 00:46:59,400
"This is amazing.

1175
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,735
Oh, my God.

1176
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,362
It's like a little San Francisco here.

1177
00:47:03,446 --> 00:47:06,532
It's like a freshwater Monaco.

1178
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:10,786
Why have I never heard
of this Duluth, Minnesota?

1179
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,039
We definitely have to shoot here.

1180
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,749
We want to use local talent,

1181
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,083
all local catering.

1182
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:18,252
Let's start getting lists of people

1183
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,922
who may be interested
in acting in a television series

1184
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,382
in the area.

1185
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:24,717
We'll see you next month."

1186
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,345
And then what happened...

1187
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,973
is nothing.

1188
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,227
And, uh...

1189
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:36,562
I was left...

1190
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,064
I told my mom, and she was,

1191
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:41,567
"Honey, but they came to supper twice,

1192
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:44,862
and they said that I was very talented

1193
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,906
and your father had a gift,

1194
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,449
and that...

1195
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,952
everyone at the lake could play a part."

1196
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,830
Oh, Mother.

1197
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,835
We just need to go to each
person and tell them

1198
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,421
they've actually had one of the most

1199
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,466
authentic show business experiences...

1200
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,635
you can have.

1201
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,640
Which...

1202
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,142
is being given the full ghost.

1203
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,020
Don't know what ghosting is?

1204
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,689
That's when someone declares
their undying love for you,

1205
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,442
and then disappears off
the face of the Earth.

1206
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:25,569
Can't happen in a small town.

1207
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,947
The person will just say,
"I see you over there."

1208
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,616
[audience laughs]

1209
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,243
I tried to explain to my mom

1210
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,537
that show business is like having a friend

1211
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,455
with a terrible drinking problem.

1212
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,041
I love her so much.

1213
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:40,835
She's so much fun

1214
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,962
if you get her at right...

1215
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,297
The just... the right time of...

1216
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:48,300
"You're the most beautiful.

1217
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:50,177
So, you're my best friend.

1218
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,554
I love you, okay?

1219
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,555
Only you.

1220
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,098
It's just me and you, okay?

1221
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:56,058
And literally loving you."

1222
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:57,560
The next day,

1223
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,813
she may have forgotten
about that of which we spoke.

1224
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,150
I'm sorry, I don't know who you are.

1225
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:07,027
This is hot dogs,
they're for principal talent only.

1226
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,991
The background extras' hot dogs

1227
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:14,493
are behind two warehouses

1228
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,078
and a semi that's running.

1229
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:20,749
They are the same exact hot dogs.

1230
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:23,377
But they are 2,000 yards away

1231
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,921
behind a truck that's on.

1232
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,929
We live next to a frat house

1233
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,264
and, uh...

1234
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,057
it's just as funny as you think.

1235
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,269
One night,
they were playing <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>

1236
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,563
uh, about 3:30 a.m.

1237
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,941
Which I did not realize
was still speaking to people.

1238
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,026
And...

1239
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:51,989
my husband pulled up his, uh,
pajama pants,

1240
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,616
all the way up to his little beard.

1241
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,243
I put on my t-shirt nightgown

1242
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:58,329
with the long slit

1243
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:00,122
that I got in 1994

1244
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:02,750
from the Minneapolis St. Paul Airport

1245
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,835
with the moose on it.

1246
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,128
[audience laughs]

1247
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,717
And we went on over there and said, "Hey.

1248
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,011
You guys,

1249
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,639
we don't have jobs, but come on."

1250
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:19,433
[audience laughs and applause]

1251
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,186
"Oh, so sorry.

1252
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,029
You know, so sorry about the noise,
you guys.

1253
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:25,397
Hey, come on, you guys.

1254
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:26,690
Let's shut it down!

1255
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:28,293
We're waking up the whole neighborhood.

1256
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,486
Hey, so sorry about this, you know?

1257
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,612
Normally, you know,

1258
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,656
we're just like you guys, you know?

1259
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:34,740
We're total nerds."

1260
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,246
Wait, nobody said anything about nerds.

1261
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,835
"Yeah, but it's our senior year,

1262
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:49,713
so we're just really
trying to enjoy our house."

1263
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:52,049
Oh, we get it.

1264
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,011
Yeah, Scott's 52 and I'm 46.

1265
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,140
This year we're gonna do it.
We're gonna try anal.

1266
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,725
[audience laughing]

1267
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,609
So if you hear any, "Yelps!"

1268
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,572
It's just pleasure.

1269
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,539
We're just trying to enjoy our house.

1270
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,082
[audience laughs]

1271
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:27,501
[applause]

1272
00:51:32,715 --> 00:51:34,967
We have a lot of sex.

1273
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,511
A lot of fudging and wedging

1274
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,763
and lotions and potions

1275
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,808
and unguents and poultices,

1276
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,852
jams and jellies.

1277
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,397
Custards, mustards, sauces,

1278
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,899
souses, and foam soups,

1279
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,526
smoothing milks.

1280
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,485
Hustle, bustle,

1281
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,154
hustle, bustle, hustle, bustle.

1282
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,281
Hammer, anvil, hammer,

1283
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,284
anvil, hammer, anvil!

1284
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,702
[audience laughing]

1285
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:07,833
I have to say it,

1286
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,252
I used to look down
on people with hobbies.

1287
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,628
And, uh...

1288
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,382
I was like,

1289
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:18,218
"What are you doing over there
for no money?

1290
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,222
You getting any cash
on the back end of this hiking deal?

1291
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,101
This walk to nowhere?"

1292
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:31,231
And then I looked down
at what I was always doing

1293
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,610
very happily for fun and for free.

1294
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:39,656
I was always filling out
a self-help manual of some kind.

1295
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,492
I have not changed

1296
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:44,411
discernibly in 25 years,

1297
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,915
which means I've been playing a very long,

1298
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,958
super fun game

1299
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,960
of emotional Sudoku.

1300
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,131
My husband and I
got a board going at home.

1301
00:52:56,215 --> 00:52:58,717
Your great-grandfather
was a violent alcoholic

1302
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:01,095
who was in the army who beat his son,

1303
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,679
who was a violent alcoholic

1304
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:04,807
in the army who beat his son,

1305
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,308
who was a violent alcoholic

1306
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:08,852
in the marines who beat you.

1307
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,480
You're not in the armed services at all.

1308
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,773
You don't drink.

1309
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,025
But you have PTSD so bad

1310
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:19,196
that you think you can clench
your buttocks and fly the plane.

1311
00:53:21,782 --> 00:53:23,075
That part's done.

1312
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,789
My great-grandmother had six kids

1313
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:32,126
and then could never leave
her attic to raise them.

1314
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:36,046
My grandmother died
in a fire of her own making.

1315
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:40,259
My mother has 15 grand
in a secret savings account

1316
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,010
just in case next time she goes manic

1317
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:44,138
she wants to stay in a nice hotel.

1318
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:47,808
I have this thing called Vaginismus.

1319
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:51,437
Anytime something interesting
gets near my vago,

1320
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,063
she slams shut!

1321
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:55,899
And I gotta convince her to flower open

1322
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,110
with juice and stories.

1323
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,989
All we need is, uh...

1324
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,241
two alcoholics, a suicide,

1325
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,493
and a Seven,
and we could break for popcorn.

1326
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,911
[audience laughs]

1327
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,122
It's so much fun!

1328
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,127
Have you ever read the work
of Dr. John and Judy Gottman?

1329
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,587
They're family therapists.

1330
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,423
You-you watch for the <i>Four Horsemen</i>
of the Apocalypse

1331
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,967
in all of your relationships
without criticism, contempt,

1332
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,635
defensiveness, and stonewalling.

1333
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:25,304
So let's say your friend says,

1334
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:27,139
"Hey, look at that sailboat!"

1335
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,223
You say "Criticism."

1336
00:54:28,307 --> 00:54:30,350
That's a stupid sailboat. Contempt."

1337
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,269
You and your fucking sailboats!

1338
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,395
Fuck.

1339
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:34,688
Uh, defensiveness.

1340
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,399
I'm not into sailboats,
I have nothing to do with sailboats!

1341
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:38,692
Stonewalling.

1342
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,027
[audience laughs]

1343
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:44,364
And they gave us this magnet
that looks like a piece of flooring,

1344
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,135
and you hand it to your partner
when you're done speaking and you say,

1345
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,911
now you have the floor.

1346
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:49,994
And...

1347
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:52,998
It costs $900.

1348
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:55,334
We got our pictures taken
with their cardboard cutout

1349
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:56,668
'cause they couldn't be there.

1350
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:57,753
And they've...

1351
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,172
they've also gave us an acronym for love,

1352
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,008
which is,
Letting Others Voluntarily Evolve.

1353
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:06,178
It was so fucking fun!

1354
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,721
[audience laughs]

1355
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,016
[applause]

1356
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,439
Um, my husband and I do LARP.

1357
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,399
We Live Action Role Play...

1358
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,109
as our mothers.

1359
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,111
[audience laughing]

1360
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:26,698
Hey, Linda.

1361
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:28,659
Listen, it's Marilyn.

1362
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,329
I got myself a new purse
with my Hilton Honors Points

1363
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,580
and I just, uh,

1364
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:34,831
I thought of you.

1365
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:37,668
Oh, Marilyn, I don't need a purse.

1366
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,046
I got nothin' to put in one.

1367
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,631
Nowhere to go.

1368
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,342
Well, Linda,

1369
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,594
you need to treat yourself.

1370
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,222
You raised four beautiful children

1371
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,933
through very difficult circumstances,

1372
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:53,934
and you...

1373
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,852
I had nothing to do with it.

1374
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:58,021
They had a horrible childhood.

1375
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,650
I'm amazed that they even survived.

1376
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,278
Well, you know, Linda,

1377
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,737
You know, the thing, kid,

1378
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:07,072
the thing, yeah.

1379
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,157
I... When...

1380
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,325
I...

1381
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,998
You never worked a day
in your life, Marilyn.

1382
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,001
I worked for 40 years as a nurse.

1383
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,086
I stood over men's deathbeds

1384
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,715
as they begged for hand jobs
with their dying breath.

1385
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:28,093
She actually says "Blowjobs",

1386
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,929
but please don't say
that because it's my mother.

1387
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,438
Well, I gotta tell you,

1388
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,690
once you give Maria a detail, you know?

1389
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:44,234
It's kind of out of all of our hands.

1390
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,611
[audience laughing]

1391
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,738
Uh...

1392
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:50,824
Linda, I get it, you know.

1393
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,992
My husband Joel,

1394
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,285
I'm a kept woman.

1395
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,413
He's 75 years old,
but he still has his appetites, you know?

1396
00:56:56,496 --> 00:57:00,125
Sometimes I feel like I wear a diamond
solitaire necklace like a yoke.

1397
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:06,465
Would you want to watch
one of my hundreds of DVDs

1398
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,052
starring anything with Timothy Olyphant?

1399
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:16,183
We could have some
chocolate-dipped strawberries

1400
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,893
from Shari's Berries,

1401
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,937
still cold from the Internet.

1402
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:24,399
You can't sit next to me.

1403
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,401
I don't like people.

1404
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:27,861
Uh, listen, Linda.

1405
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:30,572
I'll put my purse between us,

1406
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:34,368
and we can pretend
we're in Delta economy comfort.

1407
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,370
Give ourselves an upgrade.

1408
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,580
We deserve it. [laughs]

1409
00:57:40,207 --> 00:57:41,583
[applause]

1410
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,543
Sorry. Fine.

1411
00:57:45,337 --> 00:57:46,838
[laughs] So, it's rude.

1412
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,299
This is more one-woman show territory.

1413
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,176
[audience laughs]

1414
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,263
[whispers] Apologies, apologies.

1415
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,851
Okay, this is the scariest part
of the show.

1416
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,314
I'm trying to believe in something,

1417
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:05,399
and, uh...

1418
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,318
I can't, there's something more,

1419
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,778
more bigger

1420
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,531
than myself,

1421
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,366
and I just, I just can't,

1422
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,076
I can't think of anything.

1423
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,411
And, um...

1424
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,582
But then I remember there's this game
that we used to play when we were kids,

1425
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:24,459
and it's called One Big Blob.

1426
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,130
What happens: I'm it,

1427
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,090
you run away from me,

1428
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,092
frightened, afraid.

1429
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,803
I begin running after you,

1430
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,013
while chanting,

1431
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,682
one big blob!

1432
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,101
One big blob!

1433
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,396
One big blob!

1434
00:58:45,439 --> 00:58:47,649
Eventually I end up catching one of you,

1435
00:58:47,733 --> 00:58:49,109
and it's gonna be you.

1436
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,195
I got you.
Come on, take my hand, take my hand.

1437
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,323
And now we both have to begin chanting.

1438
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,659
One big blob!

1439
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,370
One big blob!

1440
00:59:00,454 --> 00:59:02,497
Now you catch the person next to you.

1441
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:03,623
I know.

1442
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,167
One big blob!

1443
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,311
And then we start catching each other.
Come on, you guys!

1444
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,005
It takes a long time,

1445
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,339
and a lot of effort.

1446
00:59:11,423 --> 00:59:13,258
Come on, everybody!

1447
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:15,218
[all] One big blob!

1448
00:59:15,302 --> 00:59:16,470
Join hands.

1449
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:18,764
[all] One big blob!

1450
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,349
One big blob!

1451
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,684
I'm gonna wait!

1452
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:24,603
One big blob!

1453
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,937
I don't want to do it, either.

1454
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,898
One big blob!

1455
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,151
One big blob!

1456
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,779
One big blob!

1457
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,198
One big blob!

1458
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,407
I know it's weird.

1459
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,034
One big blob!

1460
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,118
You can do it!

1461
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,162
One big blob!

1462
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,040
One big blob!

1463
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,834
One big blob!

1464
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:49,461
One big blob!

1465
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,088
That's great. Okay, now...

1466
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:53,799
This is great.

1467
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,009
Isn't it uncomfortable to be in the blob?

1468
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,803
It's so awful!

1469
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,471
Your hands are sweaty.

1470
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:02,432
But you have to do it,

1471
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,685
and we gotta stay together because
you have to catch the one outlier,

1472
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,979
probably that guy who's going out
the back door,

1473
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,940
the apparent winner, but is he?

1474
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,316
Because he's alone.

1475
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,442
He is alone.

1476
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:16,404
And everyone must let themselves be caught

1477
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,615
because otherwise the game will never end,

1478
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:20,617
and it is a shit game.

1479
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:24,079
Everybody just wants to play soccer,

1480
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:26,414
a game of individual
achievement and glory.

1481
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,999
So, um, anyways,

1482
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,168
if we could just blob it on a few things.

1483
01:00:30,252 --> 01:00:33,338
Um...
I could hang a religion on that.

1484
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,298
Anyways, that's my, that's what I love.

1485
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:36,984
- Thank you so much for cooperating!
- [audience cheering]

1486
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:39,010
That was amazing! That was fun!

1487
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,220
One big blob.

1488
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,223
I should have blobbed with you, Arnold.

1489
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,975
I should have blobbed with you.

1490
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,145
Thank you so much. Thank you!

1491
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,940
Thank you so much!

1492
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,733
Thank everybody on this flat,

1493
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,861
and on the balcony!

1494
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,321
Thank you so much. Thank you!

1495
01:00:58,405 --> 01:00:59,489
[chuckles]

1496
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,826
I have one more song.

1497
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:05,579
Please have your seats,

1498
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,662
have your seats.

1499
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,206
I have one more song, and, um...

1500
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,792
I love music.

1501
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,337
And, you know,
I'm not trained, uh, classically.

1502
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,214
But, uh...

1503
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,966
I've been working on some...

1504
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:19,801
[mimics farting]

[farting rhythmically]

1506
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,693
Oh, those are just fart noises.

1507
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:38,028
[audience laughs]

1508
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:39,196
Yes.

1509
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,615
Yes, they are.

01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:58,673
Oh, that's not music.

1513
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,592
That's what they said about Stravinsky,

1514
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,220
Philip Glass, the punks.

1515

[mimics farting]

1516
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,264
If this is my song,

1517
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:08,683
how can I keep from singing?

Who said, "Jesus Christ, Maria.

1526
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,349
Aren't you even writing anymore?"

No.

No, I am not.

[mimics farting]

Hmm, I just wrote that.

Do a serious face, serious face now.

1542
01:03:28,722 --> 01:03:30,432
Yeah!

1543
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:31,933
That's good stuff.
