Wow, wow, wow, wow.

00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,760

[loud cheer]

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,520
All right, all right, all right,
we gotta be nice.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,960
Because this is an international filming,
so there's white people over here.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,960
They gotta know who we are, all right?

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,800
So, hello. Hi.

22
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,840
Sir, you're obviously not from Singapore.
My name is Fuzz.

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,480
I am a Malay from Singapore.

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,880
If you are wondering what this is,

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,240
this is what a Singaporean
was supposed to look like. Okay?

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
[audience laughing]
No.

27
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,560
Oh, man.

28
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,200
It's hard, isn't it, man?

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,960
We tried to travel the world
and try to tell people that we are Malay,

30
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,920
but we cannot do that, because why?

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,160
Every country you go to,

32
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,040
there is a race
that looks like you, right?

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,320
Right, you cannot be exotic
if you are a Malay. You know, huh?

34
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,200
If you go to the Philippines,
you're Filipino, right?

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,360
If you go to Thailand, you're Thai, right?

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,120
If you go to the U.S., you are deported.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,440
Do you know what I'm saying?

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
[all laughing]

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,920
Any Malaysians in the house?

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,320
-[man #1] Yeah!
-[Fuzz] Yeah!

41
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,800
[in Malay] Oh, you guys are up there!
What am I going on about?

42
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,960
[laughs]

43
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
Malaysia, man. You know... Malaysia is a great place, okay?

44
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,040
But there are some things in Malaysia
that they are good at,

45
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,880
that we are not good at.
We have to admit that, all right?

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,479
And this... Whenever I come to Singapore,
no, whenever they come to Singapore,

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,640
right, and I go to Malaysia,
I can see the differences.

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,600
For example,

49
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,880
crime.

50
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,480
We are not very good in crime, okay?

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,920
Give that to the Malaysians, right?

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,600
[laughter]

53
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,760
[Fuzz chuckles]

54
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,840
They're good, they're good.
They're very good at it.

55
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,120
I give you the same crime...

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,680
[audience chuckling]

57
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,480
First of all, I didn't know
how dangerous Malaysia was.

58
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,160
I didn't know, okay? I didn't know.

59
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,680
My friends told me, they said, "Fuzz,

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,000
don't walk down the streets
of Bukit Bintang at night,

61
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,920
it is dangerous."

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,640
I said, "Bro, I am Malay.

63
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,160
Bro, if I ever get robbed,
I can get my money back.

64
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,720
It's probably my cousin. No problem."

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
[laughter]

66
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,760
I got robbed at knifepoint, you know, huh.

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,200
And they all say, "Don't walk down here,
it's quite dangerous.

68
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,240
Don't walk down here,
it's quite dangerous," right?

69
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,520
And I got robbed at knifepoint.

70
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,720
And it's not the fact that I got robbed
that was weird,

71
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,920
it's after the guy robbed me.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,760
He said, "You better be careful over here,
quite dangerous." I'm like...

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,320
[audience laughing]

74
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Crime can't work in Malaysia, man.
It cannot.

75
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,080
It cannot work in Malaysia
the same way it works in Singapore.

76
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,000
It can't. I give you the same crime.

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
Both in Singapore,

78
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,600
and Malaysia, and I'll tell you
why it doesn't work, right.

79
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,280
What is the crime that's very common?

80
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,640
Snatch theft by motorcycle, okay?

81
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,840
Snatch theft by motorcycle.

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,320
This is if it's in Malaysia.

83
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,960
There is a pillion, there's a rider,

84
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,600
and there's an unsuspecting woman.

85
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,360
[in Malay]
"Okay, bro. Are you ready, bro?"

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
I just assumed he's Malay. I assumed.

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,800
[audience laughing]

88
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,840
Based on general headlines, okay?

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,200
[in Malay]
"Okay, bro. Are you ready, bro?"

90
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,680
"Okay, bro, get the bitch's purse, bro.
Get the bitch's purse."

91
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,480
"Go, go, go!"
[imitates whooshing]

92
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,440
You will never see
that person ever again, right?

93
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,880
In Singapore, it's a bit different.

94
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,000
Pillion, rider, girl.

95
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,760
"Okay, bro, get the bitch's purse, bro.
Get the bitch's purse."

96
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,320
"Go, go, go! Hey, why did you stop?"

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,680
"Traffic light, bro."
[audience laughing]

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,440
But, ladies and gentlemen,

99
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,440
it is a good time
to be a Malay in Singapore,

100
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,000
I must say,
because our president is Malay!

101
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,200
[audience cheering]

102
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,600
[Fuzz chuckling]

103
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
Because it's great, right?

104
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,360
And, at first, when we heard

105
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,280
that the presidential candidate
was reserved for a Malay,

106
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,560
this is how the Malay community
responded in Singapore.

107
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,079
"Look, we don't need your handouts, okay?

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,760
We don't function
on race-based politics like..."

109
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,600
[gibbers]
Okay?

110
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,360
"Right, we are a meritocracy.

111
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,360
If we want to make it to presidency,
it must be on merit.

112
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,200
Not because we are of a certain race.

113
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,280
So we don't care if it's Malay, Chinese,
Indian, others.

114
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,120
As long as the person deserves the job,

115
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,680
the person should get the job."
Correct or not? Right?

116
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,760
Right. And then they say,
"You're not gonna take it?"

117
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,600
"No, no, yes, we are.
But we're very upset."

118
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,240
[laughter]

119
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Because, ladies and gentlemen,
it's a very good time to be Malay,

120
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,840
right now that Halimah is president.

121
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,080
Oh, my god, every good thing
that happens in Singapore,

122
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,720
we blame it on Halimah, you know, huh?

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,400
"The weather is good today."
"Halimah, bro."

124
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,640
"Wow, there's <i>sambal belacan</i> today."

125
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,160
"Halimah, bro."

126
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,600
"You're 20 minutes late for work today."

127
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,640
"I don't care. Halimah, bro."

128
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
[chuckles]

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,400
Like I said, ladies and gentlemen,
being Malay in Singapore is great.

130
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,040
You know, but racism starts
very early, right?

131
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,360
When they ask you
about your ambitions in school,

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,160
when they ask an Indian guy, they go,

133
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,920
"Rajah, what do you want to be in school?"
Rajah, the kid says,

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
"I want to be a lawyer." You know?

135
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,240
Ask, "Mei-ling, what do you want to be
when you grow up?"

136
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,800
You know, Mei-ling says,
"Oh, I want to be an accountant."

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,760
Ask the Malay person,

138
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,520
"What you want to be
before you go to jail?"

139
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm like, "Hey, come on."

140
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
[laughing]

141
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,920
But Chinese people,
I know you guys are here,

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,520
but you guys are racists sometimes,
and you don't even know it.

143
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,000
You don't even know it.

144
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,320
Yeah, you don't even know it.

145
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,720
Like, my friend came up to me
and went, "Fuzz, Fuzz.

146
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,720
I am very jealous...

147
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,360
of all y'all Malay couple, you know.

148
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,800
Because me and my wife
are married for five years."

149
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,640
He goes, "Me and my wife,
married for five years, cannot get baby."

150
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,360
A Malay couple who are married for a year,

151
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,640
baby is already nine years old."
I'm like, "Come on, man."

152
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
[audience chuckling]

153
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,800
But our president is Malay,
ladies and gentlemen.

154
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,880
Our president is Malay,
and it's a Malay auntie.

155
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,040
Okay?
[audience laughing]

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,320
[Fuzz] So, you know...

157
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,120
global discussions are gonna be
very, very easy. Okay?

158
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,240
We are going to win
all of the discussions.

159
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,400
Right? Because nobody guilt-trips you
more than a Malay auntie, okay?

160
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,680
[loud laughter]

161
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Nobody!

162
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,080
[applause]

163
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,320
You can be sitting down in the conference.

164
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,200
Everybody looking at the Malay auntie

165
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,640
going, "Singapore, we do not agree
with your ways.

166
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,040
This is not right, Singapore.
You are wrong."

167
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,360
And the Malay auntie can go,

168
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,400
[in Malay]
"Sure, I'm not as smart as you all are.

169
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,080
[loud laughter]

170
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,360
[in Malay]
Who am I anyway?

171
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,800
I am not educated like all of you."

172
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,280
[chuckles]

173
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,200
Saying that it's not right for a Malay.

174
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,680
Saying that it's not right
because we didn't vote them in.

175
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,280
Huh? What is the president's job
in Singapore?

176
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,760
Shows up at National Day for 20 minutes,

177
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,040
and sits down at the house
for the rest of the year.

178
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,640
That is a perfect job for a Malay. Okay?

179
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,120
[laughter]

180
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,160
Any Malay would love to do that!

181
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,880
[chuckles]

182
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,800
Oh, my god.

183
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,760
And you know she will be with her friends
on the phone all the time, right?

184
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,080
Now, Singapore, we're gonna have
all the intel from all over the world. Because an auntie is president, okay?

185
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,000
[in Malay] "Do you want to know
what China said yesterday?

186
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,240
[audience laughing]

187
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,440
[in Malay] Yes. I'm not trying to say
bad things about them.

188
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,400
[in Malay]
But their child is such a bitch.

189
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,680
[in Malay]
I'm not trying to bitch about them."

190
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,800
How is it? I don't understand this!

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
I don't understand.

192
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,320
You need subtitles, I get it.
Just wait till the show comes out.

193
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,880
[laughter]

194
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,800
[Fuzz chuckles]

195
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,920
I don't understand how the aunties can go,

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,720
"I am not talking bad about you,

197
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,360
but I will proceed
to talk bad about you, right?"

198
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,000
[chuckles]

199
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,160
Oh, man.

200
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
Oh, I love it.

201
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,800
Imagine... Imagine cleaning up Singapore
when a Malay auntie is president.

202
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,400
That is gonna be so bad, right?

203
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,240
Cleaning up Singapore
is going to be such a hassle.

204
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Because the Malay auntie, man...

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,440
Have your mom ever cleaned up your...

206
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,080
You know she's not gonna shut up
when she cleans your house, right?

207
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,960
When a Malay auntie Halimah
cleans the streets,

208
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,720
[in Malay]
"If I don't do it, no one else will.

209
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,840
[in Malay]
I'm your maid, aren't I?"

210
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,000
[laughter]

211
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,360
Oh, man.

212
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,920
You think Halimah
has that Malay mother's sneeze, man?

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,680
You know how... I mean, I don't think
it exists only in Malay mothers.

214
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,800
I think it exists
in all mothers, you know.

215
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,559
You know mothers
have two sneeze voices, right?

216
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,039
Two sneeze voices. You know
what I'm talking about, right, huh?

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,840
Mothers, when they are outside,

218
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,120
in a social setting like this,
all these aunties, aunties,

219
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,280
whenever they sneeze, they go...
[imitates soft sneeze]

220
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,200
[laughter]

221
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,360
[imitates soft sneeze]

222
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,280
But at home, it's like...
[imitates loud sneeze]

223
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,320
[audience laughing]

224
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,640
[in Malay] And you go,
"Gosh, I thought somebody died!"

225
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,800
[laughter]

226
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,800
[Fuzz] Oh.

227
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,960
It's weird, it's weird, it's weird.

228
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,840
But it's nice to be here,
ladies and gentlemen.

229
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,120
I must say, okay,

230
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
being a Malay brother,
I see a lot of Chinese people,

231
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,720
I don't mean to rip on you all, okay?

232
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,560
[in Mandarin]
Don't worry. Don't be surprised.

233
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,960
[in Mandarin] Don't feel weird
looking at a Malay performing.

234
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,840
[in Mandarin]
I'm not here to steal your stuff.

235
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,400
[in Mandarin] I'm just here
to entertain you with my jokes, okay?

236
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,840
Don't be surprised I know Mandarin.

237
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
You know what they say,
you have to know your enemy. [audience laughing]
I'm kidding.

238
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,280
[chuckling]

239
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,960
I love Chinese people.

240
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,120
I had a friend in school,
his name is Wei-xiong, okay?

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,920
And I am one of the Malay boys
who is very, very thankful

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
of my Chinese friend Wei-xiong.

243
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,440
Because if it wasn't for Wei-xiong,

244
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
I would not have made it
to primary school.

245
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,080
Because I would copy his homework,

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,200
every day of the week, okay?

247
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,000
And Wei-xiong is very good. "Copy, copy.
Can, can, can. Copy, copy. Can, right?"

248
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,560
Right, I would copy his homework
every day, right.

249
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
And I would always get detention

250
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,880
because I used to copy his homework
all the time.

251
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,920
But Wei-xiong never got detention.

252
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Until one day, Wei-xiong got detention.

253
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,240
He sat next to me.

254
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,640
I looked at Wei-xiong,
Wei-xiong looked at me.

255
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,080
I asked him, "Wei-xiong,

256
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,800
why are you in detention?

257
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,200
He says, "I said <i>lan jiao</i> in class."

258
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,720
For those of you who don't know
what <i>lan jiao</i> is,

259
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
<i>lan jiao</i> means "penis" in Hokkien, okay?

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,080
"I said <i>lan jiao</i> in class."

261
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,320
I turned to him, I said,
"Wow, that's some gangster shit, man."

262
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,240
[chuckles]

263
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,720
Right? Just then, the teacher walks in,

264
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,320
"Wei-xiong, I am very disappointed
in you, okay?

265
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,400
I have already called your father,
and your father is on the way right now.

266
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,760
Wei-xiong, you wait, you wait,
you wait!" Right?

267
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
[chuckles]

268
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,760
And then, just then, the father comes in.

269
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,200
The father says, "Why?
Why is my son being punished? Why? Why?

270
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
The teacher says,
"Your son said <i>lan jiao</i> in class."

271
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,400
The father said to his son,

272
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,240
[in Chinese]
"Fuck your mother, you cunt!"

273
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
[audience laughing]

274
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,160
[chuckles]

275
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,720
It starts from home.

276
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,720
Oh, man.

277
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,400
A lot of weird shit is happening
in Singapore, ladies and gentlemen.

278
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
A lot of weird shit is happening
in Singapore, right?

279
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,760
For example, not too long ago,

280
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,840
China just said, "We don't wanna
be friends with you, Singapore.

281
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,120
We don't wanna be friends
with Singapore anymore."

282
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,520
You know, they had a whole conference
in China,

283
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,160
and they did not invite Singapore.

284
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,280
That's some 14-year-old
passive-aggressive shit.

285
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,680
"I've got a party, I'm not inviting you."

286
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,360
Passive-aggressive shit, right?

287
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,040
And it was big news in Singapore.

288
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
They said, "What?
China is not our friend anymore?

289
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,640
Oh, no! They had a whole conference
and they did not invite us."

290
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
And it was big news. Do you know why?

291
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,040
Because for the first time ever
in Singapore,

292
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,720
the majority of Singapore
knows what it feels like

293
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,360
to be discriminated
by Chinese people, okay?

294
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,280
[Fuzz laughing]

295
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,760
They were like,
"Oh, that's how it feels like."

296
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,720
Then they had that whole competition
called <i>The Voice.</i>

297
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,480
You remember that? Huh?

298
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,120
Online, there was a whole
singing competition called <i>The Voice.</i>

299
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,920
They said, "<i>The Voice</i>, huh?

300
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,200
It's in Mandarin.

301
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,400
Why is it in Mandarin? Huh?"

302
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
And everybody was like,

303
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,520
"It's a Mandarin show.
Of course, it's sung in Mandarin."

304
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,640
Which is okay.

305
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,440
What I like... I didn't mind that.

306
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,880
What I didn't like was the fact
that my Chinese friends came up to me,

307
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,400
"Instead of you being mad
that it is a Mandarin singing show,

308
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,040
you all should learn Mandarin,

309
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,920
so that you guys can sing Mandarin songs."

310
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
I said, "Okay, can.

311
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,360

is there's a lot of diversities

That's all I'm saying, you know. Right?

Being a black man is great, though, right?

345
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,640
A lot of stereotypes about the black man
that I'm jealous about.

346
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,640
They say black men have big penises.

I don't know if it's true,
so I did my research.

Not in the way
that you thought I did, okay?

I did my research.

350
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,400
I asked a friend of mine
who married a black man,

351
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,960
if it's true that black men
have big penises.

My whole life, right?

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,040
Walk and talk like a black man.

357
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,880
You know, I had that swagger
like a black man, right?

358
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,440
Until I arrived in New York City.

359
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,360
And I went to Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn.

that we have mothers who will ensure
that we eat first before anything, okay?

And Malaysia still talks
about separation till this day.

"Eh, we separated from you, eh..."

422

Singaporeans, we seldom
talk about it anymore.

they still talk about it,
"Eh, we separated..."

"Look, it's not working out
between us, okay?

with a girl, and you look at the girl,

"Oh, my god, she's so hot." Right?

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:06,000
I love talking about...
I can't talk to women a lot because...

467
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
I get very nervous.

468
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,160
I get very nervous. Yes.

469
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,400
I get very nervous, and I try to say
the funniest things,

470
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,640
and it doesn't work, you know.

471
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,600
I tried to go to a place
to talk to women, right.

472
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,800
I went to Orchard Towers
to try to talk to women.

473
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,760
Um...
[audience laughing]

474
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
And it didn't work.

475
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,520
Because I went to Orchard Towers, right,

476
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,120
and this hooker came up to me and said,

477
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,320
"Hey there, big boy.
You look like you have a big dick."

478
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,200
I said, "Oh, thank you. So do you." And...

479
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,280
[laughter]

480
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,800
[Fuzz chuckling]

481
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,880
Oh.

482
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,240
Wow, let's just calm down for a moment,
and just bask in the fact

483
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,440
that I regret wearing
a thick-ass jacket on stage now.

484
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,960
Oh, my god, it is so hot.

485
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Yeah, I'm sweating, you know.
Can you see that?

486
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,840
I'm sweating. Do you know why, bro?

487
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,000
Because when you're bald,
you cannot absorb the heat...

488
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,800
You cannot absorb the sweat,
you got no hair.

489
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,360
So all the fucking sweat
goes down here, you know.

490
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,280
And all you can do here is
just to ignore it.

491
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,680
"Please don't go down to my eye.

492
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,920
I've got to look like I'm okay.
I have to look like I'm okay,

493
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,240
but I'm actually sweating."
[laughter]

494
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,360
Oh, man.

495
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,840
Are you guys okay
if I take this off? Yeah?

496
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
Yeah? Okay.

497
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,360
[audience cheering]

498
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,360
By the way...

499
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
[in Malay]
[man #2] It smells!

500
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,360
[in Malay] What?
[audience chuckling]

501
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,080
[sighs]

502
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,560
[laughing]

503
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
[in Malay]
You guys are unbelievable.

504
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
[audience laughing]
Really.

505
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,760
You like bald men? Is that your thing?

506
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,160
[Fuzz] Is that your thing, right?

507
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,680
[Fuzz chuckling]

508
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,960
You like it?
You know the size is, you know.

509
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,160
[audience laughing]

510
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,560
"Proportionate." That's the word
I was trying to think about right now!

511
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,960
[audience laughing]

512
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,200
[in Malay] I have been trying to recall.
"What is it called? Perpendicular?

513
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,400
[laughter]

514
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,080
Perpendicular? No!

515
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Proportionate, Fuzz!

516
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,960
Proportionate!"

517
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,800
[in Malay]
Oh, my goodness!

518
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,200
[chuckles]

519
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,640
Oh, man.

520
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,120
Every race, creed, and color,
we got to accept them, man.

521
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,440
We got to accept them, you know.

522
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,800
Yes. I went to Sydney, okay.

523
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,520
And I performed in a room like this,
full of white people.

524
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,240
And I got so nervous,
because, never before in my life,

525
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,600
have I seen so many white people, sir.

526
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:12,040
Okay, I have never performed
to so many white people before in my life.

527
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I have never been
to a white person's house even

528
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,120
when he's home.

529
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,240
You know...
[laughs]

530
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,760
[audience laughing]

531
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm...

532
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,560
It's true, man.

533
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,200
And I love it. I love white people. One of the things I love about you guys,

534
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,760
is that you guys can wear anything
in Singapore.

535
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,080
You can wear anything in Singapore
and not be judged.

536
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,000
Right?

537
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,560
You can wear anything
and just walk into Zara,

538
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,920
or Topman.

539
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,760
And you guys will get treated
the same, right?

540
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,560
You guys can wear like a SpongeBob outfit,

541
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,640
you know, with pants on
and sandals, right?

542
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,840
You guys can walk in
and the store owner will be like,

543
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,680
"I think it's their culture.

544
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,360
It's their culture."

545
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,000
"Boss, the white man touched my breast."

546
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,800
"Never mind, it's their culture.

547
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,080
[audience laughing]

548
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,160
It is their culture." Right?

549
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,840
I, as a Malay brother, can walk into Zara,

550
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,160
with a full suit, a silk tie,
cuff links and leather shoes.

551
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,800
A person will look at me and go,
"The interview is tomorrow, okay?"

552
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,520
[audience laughing]

553
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,000
But my favorite type of white person,

554
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,200
let me tell you who
my favorite type, right, is,

555
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,560
white American girls
who come to Singapore,

556
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,240
and experience Singapore
for the first time.

557
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,760
The moment they land in Singapore, okay,

558
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,840
they touchdown, they look at Singapore,
they go,

559
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,520
[in girlie tone]
"Oh, my god, so much culture!

560
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,520
Oh, my god, Stacy,
there's just so much culture here!

561
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,880
Oh, my god, I met a friend of mine,
his name is Mohammad,

562
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,000
and for his birthday, he's a Muslim,
so I bought him a Buddha.

563
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,120
Oh, my god!
[laughter]

564
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,520
What a cultural experience!"

565
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,280
Do you realize that American girls
only try cultural stuff

566
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,560
when it's the cool shit?

567
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,400
You know, when it's like Holi,
they're throwing colors at each other.

568
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,120
"This is a cultural experience!"

569
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
[audience laughing]

570
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
Or when it's yoga. "I'm a tree, namaste.

571
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,120
I'm a tree, motherfuckers!"

572
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,320
I wanna see white girls
try the hardcore stuff, man.

573
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I wanna see you all try Ramadan
for 30 days,

574
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,960
and tell me if you like
a cultural experience or not.

575
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,120
[audience clapping]

576
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,440
"Stacy, I'm so hungry, what's going on?"

577
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,880
"I don't know, bitch,
you gotta not eat for 30 days.

578
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
You're bulimic!"

579
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,760
Oh, my god, I want white girls
to try <i>Thaipusam</i>.

580
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,520
[loud laughter]

581
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,520
Oh!

582
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,400
"We stuck needles through our nipples
and walked for five kilometers.

583
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,960
[audience laughing]

584
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,880
This is a cultural experience!"

585
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,960
[Fuzz laughing]

586
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,400
But they say,

587
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,640
you experience racism, right?

588
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,960
If you do experience racism,
you got to make it work for you.

589
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,480
And this is how
I made it work for me, okay?

590
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,480
A friend of mine was about
to drive me to a show.

591
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,360
His name is Jonathan Atherton. Right, he's an Australian.

592
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,480
He's an Australian.

593
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,480
And he makes fun of Malays all the time.

594
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,840
Any Australians in the house?

595
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,760
[soft cheer]

596
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,760
Nice. Australians. Oh, yeah, Ozzie.

597
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
Uh...
[audience laughing]

598
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,240
Oi!
[chuckles]

599
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:15,520
Oz, oi, oi, oi, ozzie, ozzie, ozzie.
Oi, oi, oi. Hey!

600
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,040
See, I don't get angry

601
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,000
when Ozzies make fun of Malays,

602
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,000
because they are kind of like the Malays
of the white world, guys. You know.

603
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,280
[audience laughing]

604
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,440
[audience clapping]

605
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,480
[Fuzz chuckles]

606
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,840
Everybody knows that Malays plus
alcohol equals Australian.

607
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,880
Everybody knows that.
[audience laughing]

608
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
I swear to god.

609
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,880
So this guy comes out
with his French girlfriend and drives up.

610
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,200
Okay, and he picks me up.

611
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,000
Because, you know,

612
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,200
we were on our way to a show
at the Dutch Club.

613
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,000
Right. He picks me up.
Jonathan picked me up.

614
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,760
With his French girlfriend in the front,
and I'm in the back, right.

615
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,480
We're on our way to a show.

616
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,040
Okay, and as we were sitting in,

617
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,440
a Malay family pulls up
right next to us in a Subaru.

618
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,880
And he looks at Jon.

619
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,200
And Jon looks at him.

620
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,480
And both of them smile and nod.

621
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,920
And Jon turns back to me
and goes, "You see that, mate?

622
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,560
We immediately connected,

623
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,320
because my car is more Malay than his car.
[laughs]

624
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,280
I said, "Jon, that's not why
you connected." He said, "Why?"

625
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,240
"Because he saw me in the backseat
and thinks that I have a white driver."

626
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,640
[loud laughter] [Fuzz chuckling]

627
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,400
[applause]

628
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,800
You got to make it work for you, brother!

629
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,320
You got to make it work for you, man.

630
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
This just came into my head. Uh...

631
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,040
You know, a lot of Malaysians, um...

632
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,920
You know, we... Malaysians
and Singaporeans, you know,

633
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,040
we try to be friends
most of the time, right?

634
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,600
But they always say that Singapore
is a strict place, right?

635
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,400
We are a very strict place.
We are a place full of rules.

636
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,000
But they've got some crazy-ass rules
in Malaysia, dude.

637
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
Some crazy rules.

638
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,760
Do you know that in Malaysia,

639
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,160
you cannot eat during Ramadan
if you're a Muslim,

640
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,520
otherwise, you will get arrested, right?

641
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,280
You get arrested and jailed in Malaysia.

642
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,000
You know, in Singapore,
we don't have that.

643
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,320
We just pretend to be Filipinos.

644
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,680
Do you know what I'm saying, yeah?
[audience laughing]

645
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,840
Every Ramadan, one of you all
pretend to be...

646
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,800
You, you look like the kind of guy
that pretends.

647
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,640
All right, you over there,
you're going to...

648
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,120
"Okay, I'm going to try this, okay. Mm.

649
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,880
Good morning, auntie,
I would like the <i>sambal belacan</i>, please.

650
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,000
Good morning, auntie,
thank you very much, auntie."

651
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,640
[in Malay]
The auntie is not feeling it.

652
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,960
[in Malay] "Would you like to have a lot
or a little rice?"

653
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,480
[audience laughing]

654
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
[chuckles]

655
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,840
But, yeah, man.

656
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,720
They get jailed in Malaysia,
if you eat during Ramadan.

657
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,760
Which is all fine.

658
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,760
I don't wanna get involved
in whatever your country wants to do.

659
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,480
However, right,

660
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,440
it must be very bad for the guy's
street cred in jail, all right?

661
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,440
Because the guy's street cred in jail
is gonna be shit, you know?

662
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,360
It's gonna be,

663
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,520
[in Malay]
"What's up with you, bro? Oh, me?

664
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,440
Oh, I stabbed an old lady, bro."

665
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,480
"Oh, my god!"

666
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,360
[in Malay]
"What's up with you, bro?"

667
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,880
"Oh, me? Oh, bro, I robbed a house, bro."

668
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,840
"What about you, bro?"

669
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,320
[in Malay]
"What's up with you, bro?"

670
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,680
"I had <i>sirap bandung</i>, bro."

671
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,320
[loud laughter]

672
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
It's not...

673
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,480
And Chinese people, you know,
wherever you guys talking about...

674
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,160
Whenever you put the blame on Malay kids,

675
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,600
this is something you guys always say
that will always be ingrained in my brain.

676
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,320
"Ahh...

677
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,520
You never do your homework."

678
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,160
If you did your homework, they go,

679
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,360
"Aha...

680
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,520
Teacher said don't do first."

681
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,560
[laughter]

682
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Right?
[audience clapping]

683
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,680
I think we need to have that guy
in every political situation, you know.

684
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,360
Right? They go, "You and your brother
and your sister fight over the house

685
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
because your father left you the house."

686
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,040
[loud laughter]

687
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,520
[audience applauding]

688
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,840
[laughing]

689
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,040
Are we gonna talk about it?
Let's fucking talk about it.

690
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,440
[chuckling]

691
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,600
[audience laughing]

692
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,080
Right, so we're talking about
38 Oxley Road, right?

693
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,760
This has been all over the news,
ladies and gentlemen.

694
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,120
All over the news, okay.

695
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,880
Brother, sister of the first family,

696
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,400
fighting over a house, right?

697
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,520
The house costs 24 million dollars.

698
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,200
Twenty-four million dollars.

699
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,800
In the Singaporean mind, two things.

700
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,920
First of all, we were like, "Oh, they
are a normal family after all, you know.

701
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,480
They fight, just like my family,
we fight also.

702
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,480
His family, her family, they all fight,

703
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,840
so they are a normal family after all.

704
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,480
Even though they are high on top,
they are normal after all.

705
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,520
Brother, sister always fight." Second thought, "Which one is the sister?"

706
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
[laughter]

707
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,840
You're lying to me. You say
you didn't think that, huh?

708
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,520
You did? You did?

709
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,000
Aha!
[audience laughing]

710
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,000
[cackles]

711
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,440
[applause]

712
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
[Fuzz laughing]

713
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,840
Oh, man!

714
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,960
Twenty-four million dollars, you know.

715
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,760
Twenty-four million dollars.

716
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,960
There's so many things that you can do
with 24 million dollars.

717
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,600
You can upgrade HDB houses.

718
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,280
You can give it to the poor.

719
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,560
You can give MediaCorp actors
acting lessons.

720
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,840
There is so much...

721
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,600
[audience laughing]

722
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,440
that you can do.

723
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,800
You're all pointing to me now.

724
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,640
[in Malay] "You're also from MediaCorp.
Shut the fuck up.

725
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,000
[in Malay] You talk too much.
I'm not trying to talk bad about them.

726
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,440
[in Malay] He's nothing less.
He's such a foul-mouthed guy."

727
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,600
Fine.

728
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
I am...

729
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,760
in MediaCorp.

730
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,040
But if I were to defend people
in MediaCorp,

731
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,040
it's not that we cannot act, okay?

732
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:00,200
It's that the directors don't give us
very good acting direction, you know.

733
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,640
They don't!

734
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,160
They say, "Fuzz, you have to be sad."

735
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,000
And I go, "Okay, I am sad. I am sad."
[whimpering]

736
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,520
"No, Fuzz, not like that. Sad.
Okay, just like this...

737
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,440
[soft whimper]

738
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
[audience laughing]

739
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,920
You try again! You try again!"

740
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,040
"Okay, okay, okay."

741
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,040
[sobbing]

742
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,640
"Fuzz, Fuzz, I tell you already,
you're acting must be subtle.

743
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,240
You're sad, it's just..."
[soft whimper]

744
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,800
[audience laughing]

745
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,760
[Fuzz chuckles]

746
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,840
What I hate, right...

747
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,360
One time, when I just got into hosting...

748
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,800
Um...

749
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,640
I tried my best
to have a neutral accent. Okay?

750
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,720
I tried my best to have a neutral accent.

751
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,280
Sometimes, I sound Malay
when I want to sound Malay. Yeah, okay.

752
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,600
But, sometimes, I move to white,

753
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,440
and sometimes, I wanna sound black,
then I sound black. Whatever, right?

754
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,920
But if I want to be neutral,
I try my best to sound neutral.

755
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,280
So, I was in this show
called <i>50 Ways to Be a Singaporean.</i>

756
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,120
Anybody watched it?
[man cheers]

757
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,640
What? Really?
[chuckles]

758
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,400
[audience laughing]

759
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,880
I wasn't expecting a response.
I was about to move on, you know.

760
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,960
God. Oh, man! How boring is your life?

761
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,520
[laughing]

762
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,840
You know that there's porn, right?
You know, you can just watch that.

763
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,360
[chuckling]

764
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,560
You just jerk off to it.
Just jerk off to it, right?

765
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,960
Malays use the left hand
'cause right hand is for eating.

766
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,000
Cannot mix.
[audience laughing]

767
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,160
[Fuzz chuckles]

768
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,480
I'm saying this with my mom in
the audience, ladies and gentlemen, huh?

769
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,200
[audience laughing]

770
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,440
Malay moms, they don't listen.

771
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,720
[in Malay]
"No. I have a good son.

772
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,400
[audience laughing]

773
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,160
[in Malay] No. He's a good boy.
He was influenced by his bad friends.

774
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,920
All his friends taught him. Not me, okay.

775
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,440
All his friends..."

776
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,720
[laughing]

777
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,320
Yeah, so I try to sound
as neutral as possible

778
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,880
when I'm on air, right?

779
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,000
So, the camera at me.

780
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,080
"Say Fuzz, the link is,

781
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,200
'Hello, welcome to <i>50 Ways to Be
a Singaporean</i>.' Can?

782
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,440
Can or not, bro? Can."

783
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,000
I said, "I'll try, I'll try.

784
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,000
Um...

785
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,640
[sighs]

786
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,320
Hello, welcome to
<i>50 Ways to Be a Singaporean</i>."

787
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,520
"Fuzz, stop! Fuzz, cut, cut! Fuzz!

788
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,240
Can you sound less Malay or not?"

789
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,840
"Less Malay," they said.

790
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,200
I was like, "What does that mean?

791
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,160
Okay, I'll try again. I'll try."
[clears throat]

792
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,080
"Hello, welcome to
<i>50 Ways to Be a Singaporean</i>."

793
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,240
"Fuzz, Fuzz, Fuzz! Less Malay!"

794
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,280
Did you know this is the sign
for "less Malay," you know?

795
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,040
This is the sign for "less Malay."
This used to be the sign that said,

796
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,040
"That Chinese fellow
has a small dick," but now...

797
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,640
[audience laughing]

798
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,560
it's is the sign for "less Malay," right?

799
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,920
I tried again.

800
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,280
I went, "Hello, welcome
to <i>50 Ways to Be a Singaporean</i>."

801
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,800
"No, no, no, Fuzz, less Malay!"

802
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,640
In the end,
I was so sick of it, I said, "Okay.

803
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,920
[in Malay accent] "Hello, welcome
to <i>50 Ways to Be a Singaporean</i>!"

804
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,480
They looked at me and went,
"Wow, Fuzz, your English improved."

805
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,320
I'm like...
[audience laughing]

806
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,000
Madness, madness.

807
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,480
Singapore...
[clicks tongue]

808
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,880
I think we have to accept the fact

809
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,840
that we have to shut the fuck up

810
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,320
when it comes to world issues, okay?

811
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,040
Because we are not tough,
we don't have anything guys, come on.

812
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,320
We don't have anything that we can do
to make the world feel threatened.

813
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,400
Okay? We don't have.

814
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,560
We just have to shut up and listen.
Shut up and listen.

815
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,320
We are small,
we have to shut up and listen.

816
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,480
You have to understand this.

817
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,520
Our army is basically just to protect us
for the time being.

818
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,480
That's it, all right?

819
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,360
Other armies around the world,
they have insane stories, you know.

820
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
They have... Oh, this U.S. Marine
died in a war in Afghanistan,

821
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,560
during a war on terrorism, right?

822
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
The Indian Army, this Indian soldier died

823
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,040
during a war in Kashmir, right?

824
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,760
Against, uh, a territorial dispute
against Pakistan.

825
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,560
In Singapore,
this Singaporean soldier died

826
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,760
during the fitness test,
do you know what I'm saying?

827
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,800
[laughter]

828
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,040
[applause]

829
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,640
And the fitness test gets easier,
and easier, and easier every year,

830
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,040
and we still cannot pass, you know, huh?

831
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,920
At first, it was five stations,

832
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,480
do a couple of pull-ups,
do a couple of sit-ups,

833
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,280
run from here to here,
run around two-point-four,

834
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,840
and then, what else do you have to do?

835
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,160
I know, sit-ups there, and that's it.
Five stations, right?

836
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,320
And then, we all fail,
"I cannot, bro. Cannot.

837
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,320
I cannot. Cannot. Cannot."
[groaning]

838
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,160
"Okay, okay, okay.
I'll tell you what. Mm...

839
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,040
You do a bit of push-ups,
do a bit of push-ups,

840
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,480
uh, and then do a bit of sit-ups,

841
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,200
and then run for two-point-four. Can, huh?

842
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,760
Do a bit of sit-up, do a bit of push-up,
you run two-point-four."

843
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,880
"I cannot. Cannot, cannot."

844
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,360
Don't be surprised, ten years later,

845
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,960
they'll be like, "Okay, bro,
you lift your arms up.

846
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:24,920
[audience laughing]

847
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,040
You lift your arms up."

848
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,240
"Oh, bro, I cannot pass."

849
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,920
I'll be like, "Never mind,
You blink. You blink for me, you blink."

850
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,880
[audience laughing]

851
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,240
"Bro, this roll call, blink 20 times, bro.

852
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,680
Cannot, bro!" [chuckles]

853
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,440
Cannot.

854
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,120
But I love the Singapore Army, okay?

855
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,680
Because the Singapore Army
serves us very well.

856
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,840
Very, very well.

857
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:52,120
In fact, I performed
during SAF Day, right.

858
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,000
And after I performed,
they were so happy that I was there,

859
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,240
and they were like,
"Fuzz, thank you so much for performing during SAF Day.

860
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,280
Can you please grab the mic

861
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,680
and say something to our fellow soldiers?"

862
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,480
So I was like, "Okay."

863
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,840
So...
[chuckles] So I grabbed the mic, I was like,

864
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,520
"Hey. Uh... Hello, everybody!
[chuckling]

865
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Happy SAF Day!

866
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,480
As a Malay, I just want to give
a shout-out to all my Malays in the Navy,

867
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,000
all my Malays in Commando,

868
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,400
all my Malays in Armor,

869
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,719
all my Malays in the Air Force,

870
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,159
and all my Malays in Intelligence.

871
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,120
All three of you are very useful to us.
Thank you very much!"

872
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,480
[laughing]

873
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,760
[audience applaud]

874
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,440
You know what?

875
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,320
They make us do weird exercises
in the army.

876
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,520
Weird, weird exercises, right?

877
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,880
Like the Buddha Clap.

878
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,440
You know what the Buddha Clap is?

879
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,239
[audience murmuring]

880
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,080
Do I really have to demonstrate?

881
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,800
[audience cheering]

882
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,159
"Buddha Clap, five counts of four,
exercise begin.

883
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,760
One, two, three, four,

884
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,480
two, two, three."
[audience laughing]

885
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,080
Yes, that is the Buddha Clap, okay?

886
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,520
One time, when I was in training
in the army,

887
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:00,480
and they were doing the Buddha Clap,
"Five counts of four, exercise begin."

888
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,880
Sergeant was walking around,

889
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,320
everybody was doing the Buddha Clap
except for one kid.

890
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,320
He did not clap, all he did was this...

891
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,320
[audience laughing]

892
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,800
Sergeant went to him, and sergeant said,

893
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,840
"Uh, hello?

894
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,760
[chuckles]

895
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,040
What are you doing?
Why aren't you doing the Buddha Clap?" "Oh, I'm a level higher
than the rest, sir.

896
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,240
[audience laughing]

897
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,320
I reached nirvana already.
They still have a long way to go."

898
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,480
[chuckles]

899
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,080
I go, "Hello, how are you doing?"

900
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,960
I saw Chinese people love to go,
"Hello! Hello, hello, hello."

901
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,760
Right? That's right. I don't know why

902
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,240
they greet each other like,
"Hello. Hello, hello, hello."

903
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,000
Everywhere I go,
Chinese people love to greet like that.

904
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,400
And no matter how close or how...

905
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,920
"Hello, hello, hello, Robert!
Robert, hello!

906
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,360
Hey, Benson! Hello, Benson!

907
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:50,600
[in Chinese] Hey, it's Andrew! Andrew!
Did you see Zi-xuan?"

908
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,040
[laughing]

909
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,960
It's not lean, you know, like Malays,

910
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,480
we greet ourselves with style, right?

911
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:58,360
We greet ourselves like that style.
We look at each other and we're like,

912
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,040
[in Malay] "How are you doing?
Bro, how are you doing?

913
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,800
[in Malay] How are you doing?"

914
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,720
You know, every time
you greet a Malay person,

915
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,960
[in Malay]
"How are you doing?"

916
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
And you ask him how his day went,

917
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,680
Malay people are never positive
with their response, you know? You know?

918
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,080
[in Malay] "Hey, bro. How's work?"

919
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,520
[in Malay] "It's okay, bro.

920
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,840
[audience laughing]

921
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,880
[in Malay] I have a lot of work.
And there's no salary increment."

922
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,160
Uh...

923
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,160
No matter what they do,

924
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,080
even if they won a million dollars,
"Hey, bro, I heard you won a million."

925
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,520
[in Malay]
"It's only one million.

926
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,880
[audience laughing]

927
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,360
[in Malay] That's nothing,
2.6 million is even better."

928
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,200
[laughs]

929
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,800
It's true, man.

930
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,280
Not like how Indians greet each other,
man. Indians greet like,

931
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,800
[in Tamil]
"Hey, bro! Hey, bro!"

932
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,280
That is if they kind of love you.

933
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,760
If they really love you,
they will greet you with a curse word.

934
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,040
[in Tamil]
"Hey, pussy!

935
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,880
[audience laughing]

936
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,880
Hey, pussy. Fucker, come here.
I love you, pussy! Hey!

937
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,320
I can see the future
through your head, bro.

938
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,400
I can see the fucking future
through your head, bro."

939
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,760
Yeah.

940
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,600
I traveled the world, man.

941
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,040
I traveled the world as a Malay brother.

942
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,320
You know, I went to New York City. It was one of the best places, I feel.

943
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,600
And I feel like, as a Muslim,
it's very interesting

944
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,120
to see Muslims all around the world.

945
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,560
Because I am not a very strict Muslim.

946
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,680
Okay? Oh, you guys are shocked?

947
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,360
Uh...
[audience laughing]

948
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,320
Surprised us,

949
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,960
[in Malay]
"Are you surprised? Really?"

950
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,480
[chuckles]

951
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,720
You know, not very strict, right.

952
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,680
And, um...

953
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,240
Sometimes, you know,
when you meet strict Muslims, right,

954
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,160
there's a certain kind of communication
that, you know, breaks in between. Like, I live with two very strict
Muslim friends, you know.

955
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,080
And I sat down, one day,
in my living room,

956
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,920
watching a documentary on dogs.

957
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,840
Turned to my friend and said,
"Bro, wouldn't it be fucking badass, bro,

958
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,640
if we owned a Rottweiler?

959
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,640
You and me, bro. We own a Rottweiler."

960
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,320
He looks at me and he goes, "Bro!

961
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,680
We are Muslim, bro!

962
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,320
We cannot own dogs, bro.

963
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
That is haram, bro.
Get that through your head!

964
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,320
You know what? Go get me another beer
and we'll talk about it, you know?"

965
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,960
[audience laughing] Now, I don't buy beer, guys.

966
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,920
Please, I don't buy beer.

967
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,400
I'm a Muslim,
I accept it if you give it to me, okay?

968
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
[audience laughing]

969
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,440
[Fuzz] I accept,

970
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,000
because there's a lot of extreme Muslims
that are into Al-Qaeda and Al-Ma'unah.

971
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,400
I'm just the kind of extreme Muslim
that's into "Al-Cohol," okay? So very...

972
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,480
[laughter]

973
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,600
[chuckles]

974
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,000
Oh, man. I like it
when you have to do this,

975
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,160
"Yeah, good!"

976
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,280
[chuckling]

977
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,560
Oh, man. Muslims around the world, man,
they communicate differently, you know.

978
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,160
They communicate differently.

979
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,880
Like, I met a friend of mine, you know.

980
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,240
He's a black guy in New York City. Right.

981
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
First of all, New York City
is the birth of hip-hop.

982
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,600
That's what it was, and I love Def Jam.
I love hip-hop.

983
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,080
Right? So I try my best
to be hip-hop in New York City,

984
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,720
but don't try that ever, okay?

985
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,320
Because they take their hip-hop
very seriously, okay?

986
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,240
They take their hip-hop
very, very seriously.

987
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,720
Came out, you know.
I was like, "Yo, man. What's up?"

988
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,680
He looks at me,
and I look at him, and I go,

989
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
"Bro, man, you guys hip-hop out here, man?

990
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,960
What are your classic songs?"

991
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,040
And he goes,
"Man, we've got a lot of classic songs.

992
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:15,320
We've got P. Diddy, man,
'Bad Boy for Life,' you know?

993
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,360
We've got a lot, man. We've got N.W.A.
<i>♪ Fuck tha police coming straight ♪</i>

994
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,760
You know what I'm saying?
We've got a lot of stuff like that.

995
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,040
What about you, man?
Are you Malay from Singapore? Yeah.

996
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,400
What are your classic songs?"

997
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,240

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,200

[audience laughing]

1003
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,640
That's our...
[laughing]

1004
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,800
Because, you know what?
Because all my life, all my life,

1005
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,240
all I wanted to do, right,

1006
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,000
in my life,
when I'm looking for jobs, right

1007
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,440
I don't care what I do,

1008
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,600
as long as I could explain my job

1009
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,560
to a Malay auntie, I'm fine.

1010
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,480
Right?

1011
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,840
And we all know, the only jobs,
that is very simple to explain

1012
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,520
to a Malay auntie, are either...

1013
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,080
you know, police, civil defense, army, teacher, pest buster.

1014
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,360
These five, you know, huh?

1015
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,320
[loud laughter]

1016
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,200
Other than that, you don't know
how to explain to her.

1017
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,360
You know? I go, like,
"No, no, I'm a comedian."

1018
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,320
[in Malay]
"Are you a clown?"

1019
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,160
Because they think that comedians

1020
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,000
are just up on the stage doing...
[imitates comical song]

1021
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,440
[sighs]

1022
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,560
So, all my life, all I wanted to be
was the hype man for Jay-Z, all right?

1023
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,360
[crowd cheering]

1024
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,240
What's wrong? You know, it's a good dream.

1025
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,920
I can't be as famous as Jay-Z,

1026
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,480
but I can be the hype man for Jay-Z

1027
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,400
because I can't rap as well as Jay-Z.

1028
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,120
If you guys don't know what a hype man is,

1029
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,920
a hype man is basically when Jay-Z goes,

1030
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,720
"<i>Yeah, I know
Yo, man, you've got a lot of problems</i>"

1031
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,200
I go, "Yeah, yeah!"
You know, I just do that, all right?

1032
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,480
[audience laughing]
Right, I just, "Yeah, yeah!"

1033
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,840
I just yell over whatever he says,
all right? How do I explain that
to a Malay auntie, huh?

1034
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,240
"No, auntie,
so there's this black guy, uh...

1035
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,760
He raps about problems, so what I do is,

1036
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,680
I just yell over him, you know.

1037
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,120
[in Malay]
"I'll just shout it out."

1038
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:16,360
[in Malay] "What the hell are you doing,
shouting and screaming like a mad person?"

1039
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,280
So, I met this black friend,

1040
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,600
and he was from New York City.

1041
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,040
The black Muslim friend came up to me
and he said, "Yo, Fuzz!"

1042
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,200
"Yeah?"

1043
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,920
"Are you gonna be in New York for long?"

1044
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I said, "Yeah,
I'm gonna be in New York for a while."

1045
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,040
"All right, man.
Do you want to do some comedy?"

1046
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,840
I was like,
"All right, I'll do some comedy."

1047
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,280
"All right, man. I'ma hook you up
with the Gotham Comedy Club.

1048
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,440
Man, as a Muslim brother
to another Muslim brother,

00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,840
[chuckles]
"Sorry, I didn't catch you the last time.

1052
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,040
What did you say?"

1053
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,640
"Nah, man. I'm trying to tell you, man,

1054
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,520
I'ma hook you up
with the Gotham Comedy Club.

1055
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,040
You and me, you know what I'm saying?

1056
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,800
We gonna do it
for the whole week, Shalala."

1057
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,360
"What are you talking about?"
"No, no! You're Muslim, I'm Muslim,

"That's what I said, Shalala, bitch!"

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,480
"Okay, you don't put 'bitch' next to...
You don't...

1064
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,240
Can you not do that?

1065
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,760
Can you not put..."
[grunts]

1066

You guys are laughing now,
but I see everybody here

"Oh, Wei Xin,
have you sent the papers already?"

It's a good thing, man.

White kids have too many symptoms, huh.

Too many symptoms.

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,800
Malay kids don't have these symptoms,
you know, just the three S.

1084
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,080
It's either stubborn, Satan, or <i>sampuk</i>.
These three, right!

[audience laughing]

1086
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,600
It's either stubborn, Satanic,
or got possessed by the devil.

1087
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,600
That's it. That's it!

1088
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,360
Sometimes, it's just stupid.

1089
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,960
We just go, "This one's stupid. Stupid.

1090
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,000
[in Malay]
Not so smart."

00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,360

Some nut allergy, lactose intolerant.

00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,400
It's nut allergy. It's nut..."

1095
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,200
There's no Malay kid
with a lactose intolerance,

1096
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,120
or nut allergies.

1097
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,560
Because, you know what?
We shove everything to his mouth.

Don't cry. Don't."

1102
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,640
They slap you and tell you not to cry,

It's true!

1108
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,240
And if our child dies, because of nuts,

1109
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,240
then that is God's will, okay?

That is God's will, okay?

00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,120
You know, that's the Malay culture.

1114
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:13,080
Everything is God's will.
It's okay, right?

1115
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,880
That is very humble of us, right?

1116
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,080
We leave everything to God.
It's very humbling, right?

1117
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,840
Everything, we leave to God,
and it's okay. It's not within our power,

1118
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,440
it's God's power, right?

1119
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,360
That's why we always get caught
for crimes, sometimes,

1120
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,240
because we're too complacent
with it, you know. Chinese people commit
the same amount of crime.

1121
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,600
It's just that Malays are not very good
at hiding it, okay?

1122
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,560
Because we leave it to God,
when we steal money,

"If God wills, we won't get caught."

Right?

Malay people steal money,
and leave it to God.

1127
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,080
Chinese people steal money
from the house of God.

Way too forgiving.

It's okay, it's okay."

1141

Malays, if you steal the piggy bank
in front of the mosque, you steal the slippers,
you're not going to get away, you know.

Different customs.

1150
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,640
We have different customs.

1151
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,680
That's what it is, different customs.
Singapore...

1152
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,080
Uh, Singapore has a lot of diversity.

1153
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,320
We have different customs.

1154
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,080
For example,

1155
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,800
Chinese, you guys have
the Hungry Ghost Festival.

1156
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,680
Malays, we have Ramadan. Right?

1157
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,440

[audience laughing]

1159
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,920
I can explain.

1160
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,480
[laughter]

1161
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,320
Right. Chinese,
during the Hungry Ghost Festival,

1162
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,880
you believe that all the ghosts,

1163
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,920
and all the demons,
and all the evil spirits, right,

1164
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,560
are free to roam for an entire month.

1165
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,160
Malays, we believe that during Ramadan,
all the ghosts, and the evil spirits

1166
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,040
are locked in a safe place,
and it's a month of purity.

1167
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,760
So, I guess, it's very awkward

1168
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:26,720
when Hungry Ghost Festival and Ramadan
fall under the same month, you know?

1169
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,920
[laughing]

1170
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,560
I really don't know which one to believe,
you know what I'm saying?

1171
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,000
All I know is that my Malay ghost can eat
after seven o'clock.

1172
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,200
That's all I know.
[chuckling]

1173
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,800
After seven o'clock, my Malay ghosts
can eat. That's all I know.

1174
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,600
Oh, man.

1175
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,680
Sometimes, you know what I like?
I like to see my Chinese friends

1176
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,400
who are Christians, burning the incense
during Hungry Ghost Festival.

1177
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:47,320
So, during Hungry Ghost Festival,
they always burn offerings, right?

1178
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,840
I like to see my Chinese friends
who are Christians, you know.

1179
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,760
"Hey, Joshua,

1180
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,320
why are you burning the offerings?
I thought you were Christian?"

1181
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,160
"No, bro, just in case. Just in case.

what you know, huh?

1183
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,320
You don't know what..." I say,
"Bro, you're burning this,

the smoke is gonna cause global warming."

"Bro, this smoke go to heaven straight.
What? You don't know?"

1186
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,560
But I ran into a very awkward situation,
ladies and gentlemen.

1187
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,920
Me, and my five-year-old niece, all right?

We were walking home.

1189
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,960
First of all, right,

1190
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
whenever we have kids and ghosts,

1191
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,320
it's always something
that is very, very sensitive, okay?

1192
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,160
Because you cannot...
The ghost might go into the kid.

1193
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,440
Right, I don't believe that.

1194
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,200
I don't believe in possessions, I don't.
You know why?

1195
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,200
Because I've never seen
a cross-possession. I've never seen.

1196
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,040
Malay kids always, very conveniently,
get possessed by Malay ghosts.

1197
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,760
Very conveniently, right? It's always,

1198

"Siti, are you okay?" "Don't bother me!"

me and my five-year-old niece, right?

1212

We were walking home one day, okay.

1213
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,720
And I saw an auntie praying.

1214
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,720
Okay, and you know how aunties pray
during Hungry Ghost festival, right?

1215
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,840
They've got the food,

1216
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,960
they've got the candles,
they've got the offerings.

1217
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:27,120
So, I knew what that was, so I walked on.

1218
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,680
But my five-year-old niece has never seen
anything like that before.

1219
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,000
So she runs to the auntie,
I'm trying to stop her.

1220
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,600
She stands next to the auntie,

1221
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:35,640
she looks at the auntie,

1222
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,760
the auntie's on her knees
with food, candles, praying.

1223
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,360
She looks at the woman,
and the auntie looks at her, and she goes,

"How did you meet your girlfriend?"

1236
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,320
What kind of a story is that?

1237
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:13,880
No story.

1238
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,560
I mean, I was like...
Bro, you look like you're my age.

1239
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,960
Do you remember how hard it was for us

1240
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,160
to get a girl's number
back in our day, right?

1241
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,800
We had to devise a plan, you know?

1242
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,600
"Okay, you know her, know her,
and know her, right?

1243
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,760
So, you're all a friend of a friend
of a friend, okay."

1244
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,240
You had to write a letter,

1245
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,200
"Will you be my friend?
Yes, no, or maybe."

1246
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,640
And then you give it, right?

1247
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,880
[audience laughing]

1248
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,640
And if it's a Chinese girl, Mei-ling.
I did that before. Mei-ling, oh.

1249
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,160
Mei-ling, like, "Oh, my god!" And then Mei-ling gave me her number,

1250
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
and I thought to myself,
"We have to plan, you know.

1251
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,480
We go home, and we plan, okay.

1252
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,840
Six o'clock, she must have come home,
showered already, now doing her homework.

1253
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,400
So I called her house,
I think the house can be okay.

1254
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,640
Right, so I called her house,

1255
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,680
and the mother picks up the phone,
and mothers are always very pissed off

1256
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,320
when they picked up the phone.
I don't know why. "Hello!"

1257
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,000
"Uh, hello, auntie.
Can I talk to Mei-ling?"

1258
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:04,240
[in Chinese]
"Who are you?"

1259
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,320
"Uh, it's Muhammad Fadzri. I'm a friend."

1260
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,400
"Muhammad?

1261
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,840
[in Chinese] Mei-ling!
Why is this Malay boy calling you?"

1262
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,040
[loud laughter]

1263
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,280
[chuckles]

1264
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,040
But I love all these social media, man.

1265
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,120
I do.

1266
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,760
You know what's my favorite? Facebook.

1267
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,640
Yes, because Facebook allows you
to connect with old friends

1268
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,880
that you haven't met in a long time, okay. I reconnected with one of my friends.

1269
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,640
Um, in fact, she was my crush
when I was in primary five.

1270
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,440
Yeah, she was my crush.

1271
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,240
And then, you know,
she messaged me and said,

1272
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,280
"Oh, my god! Are you Fuzz?"

1273
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:49,360
And I go, "Oh, my god! Are you Sarah?"
I was like...

1274
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,440
I was like, "Oh, my god!"

1275
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,560
"We should meet! We should meet!"

1276
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,920
"All right, okay, okay!
Let's meet! Let's meet! Let's meet!"

1277
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,240
And it just went higher and higher...
[high-pitched gibber]

1278
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,120
So, we met, and we sat down.

1279
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,520
It was a long time since we met, you know.
Like, maybe, 10 or 12 years, right?

1280
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,280
I'm not that young.
It's actually 20 years.

1281
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,760
Uh...
[audience laughing]

1282
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,920
I sat down, looked at her, and I said,

1283
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,360
"Before you say anything, Sarah,
I just want to let you know

1284
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:18,240
that I have had a crush on you
since primary five, okay?

1285
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,080
I have had a crush on you
since primary five."

1286
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,800
She looks at me, and she goes,
"Oh, my god!

1287
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,360
I have had a crush on you, too,
since primary five!"

1288
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,040
I was like, "Oh, my god,
this is so crazy!"

1289
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,760
I looked at her, and I said,
"Have you heard of love at first sight?"

1290
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,680
She said, "Yes!"
She looks at me and she goes,

1291
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,040
"Have you heard of Herbalife?"

1292
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,840
[audience laughing]

1293
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,680
[audience applauding]

1294
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:44,080
The next person,
who messages me about Herbalife,

1295
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,800
is gonna get a glimpse
of the afterlife, okay?

1296
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,800
[audience laughing]

1297
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,560
Coming up here with a shake challenge...

1298
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,240
Oh, man.

1299
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,840
Oh, it's true, dude.

1300
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,200
All these things are true stories, man.
I swear to god, you know.

1301
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,600
I was talking about, like,
women, you know.

1302
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,360
These women contact me,
and then sometimes,

1303
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,400
I try to talk to them,
I said this before, right?

1304
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,560
I can't really talk to them.

1305
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,280
It's very difficult for me
to talk to them.

1306
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,200
Yes, it is true.

1307
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,640
And, guys, if you have a girlfriend,

1308
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,480
if you're trying to understand
your girlfriend, well, stop.

1309
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,080
Because you can't, okay?

1310
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,400
You can never, right?

1311
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,800
I sat with a girlfriend of mine
by the river.

1312
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Okay, we saw a river snake, you know.

1313
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,040
And the river snake didn't move, right.

1314
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,640
The river snake just laid there.

1315
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,400
She looked at me and she goes,
"Oh, my god. Is it dead?"

1316
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,840
I said, "I don't know, babe.
Throw a rock at it or something."

1317
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,560
She threw a rock at it,
and it didn't move. And then, she started to cry,
she was like,

1318
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,800
"Oh, my god!
It came out here just to die!"

1319
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,080
I said, "What are you talking about?"
She said,

1320
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,640
"No, you don't understand, man, okay?

1321
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,960
We have a connection with animals.
Women have a connection with animals.

1322
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,640
Especially when this baby came up to me."

1323
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:52,080
Just when she said that,
the snake started moving towards her,

1324
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,920
and she was like,
"Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!"

1325
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,960
[audience laughing]

1326
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,880
I like all sorts of women.

1327
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,240
All sorts of women.

1328
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,120
Indian girls. Ooh!
Any Indian girls in the house?

1329
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,520
[women cheer softly]

1330
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,600
Oh, yeah! Hey!

1331
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,600
[in Malay]
Hey, girl!

1332
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,520
[laughter]

1333
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:11,360
[Fuzz] I love it! I love it.

1334
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,480
I had an Indian girlfriend,
body like <i>Baywatch,</i>

1335
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,440
body like <i>Baywatch,</i>

1336
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,360
face like <i>Crimewatch.</i> Uh...

1337
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,240
[loud laughter]

1338
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,680
Are we all right? Are we all right?
[laughs]

1339
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,560
Sir!
[chuckles]

1340
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,640
Very, very thoughtful Indian girl, too.

1341
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,920
Very, very thoughtful, Indian girl, right?

1342
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,800
For my birthday, okay,

1343
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,760
she bought me a present
that was very thoughtful,

1344
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,880
because I used to be very nervous,

1345
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,320
when I talk on the stage.

1346
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,000
And when I first started stand-up comedy,
I was very nervous, right.

1347
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,000
So, I always used to talk very fast,

1348
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,280
and they can't understand me.

1349
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,920
They cannot understand me at all.

1350
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,880
So my Indian girlfriend, on my birthday,

1351
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:55,760
she bought me a present

1352
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,160
that was a sticker,
that looked like a full stop, right?

1353
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,640
And I said...

1354
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,240
[audience laughing]

1355
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,240
And I said, "Babe,
where did you get the idea for this?"

1356
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,840
And she says, "I don't know,
just came off the top of my head."

1357
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:16,840
[laughter]

1358
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,800
[Fuzz chuckling]

1359
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,880
Oh, dude.

1360
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,560
You've got to understand it, man.

1361
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,160
You have a lot of fun in Singapore?

1362
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:27,400
Mister white man,
you have a lot of fun in Singapore?

1363
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,160
Right, you go to clubs in Singapore?

1364
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,200
Do you go to clubs? Yeah?

1365
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,880
-[man #3] I used to.
-You used to go to clubs in Singapore.

1366
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,720
A lot of stuff are illegal in Singapore,
you've got to know, right?

1367
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,680
Drugs are illegal in Singapore.
That's right.

1368
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,000
Drugs are illegal in Singapore,
which is weird.

1369
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,680
Because I have never taken drugs.

1370
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,120
[audience murmuring]

1371
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,560
Hey, hey, hey.

1372
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,160
[audience giggling]

1373
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,080
Let me elaborate.
[laughs]

1374
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,080
I've never taken heroin,
never taken ecstasy,

1375
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,720
never taken cocaine, okay?

1376
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,840
Because when we were in primary school,

1377
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,920
they always feed us with images
of people overdosing on drugs.

1378
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You remember this, right?

1379
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,800
"Don't take drugs, or else you will end up
like this guy," then foam...

1380
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,120
[groans]
You know that?

1381
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,480
So they go,
"Don't! Don't take drugs." Right?

1382
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,000
So, I looked at it, and I was like,

1383
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,400
"Okay, so don't take heroin, ecstasy,
or cocaine, all right!"

1384
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,320
So, I've never taken heroin,
ecstasy, or cocaine

1385
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,200
because I've had that image implanted
in my brain for the longest time.

1386
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,960
But I've never seen them take any pictures
of people dying from weed.

1387
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,040
That's all I'm saying.
That's all I'm saying, okay! I bet that they wanted to,
it's just that they can't.

1388
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,600
It's just pictures going...
[screaming]

1389
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,720
[in Malay]
"I'm hungry, bro!"

1390
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,240
See? Some people are laughing,

1391
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,760
some people are scared to laugh.
That's all I'm saying.

1392
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,560
[in Malay] It's really hot here, bro.
The CNB is here. Enough.

1393
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,080
[audience laughing]

1394
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,160
[in Malay]
Relax, relax, relax.

1395
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,400
[chuckles]

1396
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,960
That's Malay people taking cover... [in Malay]
Relax, relax, relax.

1397
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,280
[audience laughing]

1398
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,040
Right, right? That's it.

1399
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:53,680
Man, you go next door, you see a lot
of politicians do that, too,

1400
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,760
before they walk out and make a speech.
[chuckling]

1401
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,640
[in Malay]
Relax, relax, relax.

1402
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:00,440
[chuckles]
Oh, my god.

1403
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,760
It's true, man.

1404
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:04,480
I'm just asking you, man,
like, if you want to go to clubs, right.

1405
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:08,000
You've got to understand the tics
of the different gangsters in Singapore.

1406
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:10,360
Like Chinese gangsters,
they may seem menacing,

1407
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,800
but we are still Singaporeans,

1408
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,840
so we're not very menacing, because...

1409
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,640
Chinese gangsters
are one of the most concerned people

1410
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,240
that you will ever find, all right.

1411
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:22,920
One of the most concerned people,
because you look at the Chinese gangster,

1412
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,200
every time you bump into him
at Zouk or something.

1413
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,720
You look at the Chinese gangster,
Chinese gangster looks at you.

1414
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,680
The first question
the Chinese gangster will ask,

1415
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,560
"You got a problem with me?
You got a problem?"

1416
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,920
Very concerned, you know.

1417
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,160
[audience laughing]

1418
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,480
"You got a problem, is it?
You've got a problem?

1419
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,080
You tell me now, what is your problem?
You got a problem, is it?"

1420
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,200
Nobody took the time
to tell them your problem.

1421
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,880
That's all I'm saying, you know.

1422
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,880
Nobody turned around, "Brother."

1423
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,400
Nobody turned to talk, "Bro! Bro!

1424
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,160
I just broke up with my girlfriend!"

1425
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,520
"Brother, come here.

1426
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,320
Life must move on, okay?"

1427
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,800
Indian gangsters are very territorial,
right? You know this, bro.

1428
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,800
You know what it is. Indian gangsters,
you know, are very territorial, bro.

1429
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,840
You're looking at me, going,
"Bro, I tell you, bro,

1430
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,240
This area, bro? Don't worry, bro!

1431
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:04,880
This area? I'll take care of it for you!

1432
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,040
Don't worry, bro!
This area, I'll take care of it, bro! Bro, this is my area, bro.
I'll take care of it, bro."

1433
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,680
"What do you mean you'll take care?"

1434
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,760
"No, I work here as a security guard
at the condominium. I'll take care of it."

1435
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,960
[loud laughter]

1436
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,360
Malay gangsters...

1437
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,000
Malay gangsters are the best,
we respect women.

1438
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,000
We respect women. That's right! Huh?

1439
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,080
We will never ever spike a girl's drink.
Never. Never.

1440
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,360
First of all, there's not going to be many
Malay gangsters

1441
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,240
because there's cover charge, but...

1442
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,720
[audience laughing]

1443
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,320
[chuckles]

1444
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,480
We will never, ever, spike a girl's drink.

1445
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,040
You know, if you ask a Malay gangster,

1446
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:43,000
"Why will you never, ever,
spike a girl's drink?"

1447
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,040
He'll say, "Bro, drugs in Singapore
are too expensive, cannot share, okay?"

1448
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:48,280
[audience laughing]
Only for themselves.

1449
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,360
You hear a lot of songs, man.

1450
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,840
In the club, you like to, you know,

1451
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,040
jive to a lot of the songs
in the club, right?

1452
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,320
It's good, man. Do you like rap music?

1453
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,520
Do you like rap music, bro? [Fuzz] What's your favorite?

1454
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,320
[in Malay]
Too slow.

1455
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,920
[audience laughing]

1456
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,960
[in Malay] "I have to think...
What is it called? Why is it in English?

1457
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,680
[in Malay] I'm not prepared!

1458
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,320
[laughter]

1459
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,280
[in Malay] Should I say was or is?

1460
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,800
[audience laughing]

1461
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:29,760
[in Malay] Fuck it!
He asked me in English. Damn it!

1462
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:31,800
[in Malay] How do I...

1463
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,680
Kanye West! Kanye West! Kanye West!"

1464
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,440
[chuckling]
I love the look on your face.

1465
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,360
Look at that.

1466
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,520
Oh, man.

1467
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,160
I love rap.

1468
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,760
I like it when rappers, uh...

1469
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,640
You know, when rappers do their thing,

1470
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,120
and one of my favorite things
that I love rappers when they do it is,

1471
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,880
when they replace words with letters.

1472
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,960
I think that's great.

1473
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,160
You know, they replace words
with letters, right? Like,

1474
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,000
<i>Yo, man, X gon' give it to ya</i>

1475
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,320
<i>You know, man, I'm a real G
Yo, I'ma F you up</i>

1476
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,680
You know? So I thought that it would be
a nice thing to have a full verse,

1477
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,960
only in letters, right?

1478
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,200
And no words, it would be like,

1479
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,080
<i>♪ A, B! Stop being such a C
