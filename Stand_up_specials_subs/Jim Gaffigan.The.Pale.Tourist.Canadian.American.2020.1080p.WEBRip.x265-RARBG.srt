1
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:16,600
("O Canada" playing)

2
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:54,722
MAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
Jim Gaffigan.

3
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,057
(cheers and applause)

4
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,818
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

5
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,489
Oh, my gosh! Thank you, Canada.

6
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,826
Oh, my gosh. Thank you.
(cheering)

7
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,746
Oh. That...

8
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,624
That feels good.

9
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,709
That feels good.

10
00:01:23,793 --> 00:01:26,629
You know, I don't wanna sound
like I'm pandering,

11
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,798
but I've been lucky enough

12
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:30,382
to perform throughout the world,

13
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:31,967
and I have to tell you,

14
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:35,471
the best audiences
are here in Canada.

15
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,390
They really are. (cheering)

16
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,684
They are.

17
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:44,271
And to be honest, to be honest.

18
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:49,068
I say that about every country
I perform in.

19
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:52,696
But it made you feel good.

20
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,866
That's why people lie.

21
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,119
'Cause lying works.

22
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,664
I've had so much fun touring
in Canada.

23
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:04,750
Last weekend, I was in
Saskatchewan.

24
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:08,170
Saskatchewan. That place is
filled with perverts.

25
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:09,964
(laughter)

26
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,466
They're all perverts!

27
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:18,055
The capital is Regina?

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,183
(laughter)

29
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:24,770
That's not necessary.

30
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:29,233
Regina. They could have
pronounced it Re-gene-a.

31
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,906
They did that on purpose,
'cause they're perverts.

32
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,451
Everything in Regina
sounds sexual.

33
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:42,580
Their football team,
the Rough Riders.

34
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,164
(laughter)

35
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,460
That's inappropriate.

36
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,839
I'm just relieved their mascot
wasn't a beaver.

37
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,257
You know what I mean?

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,218
It's not me, it's them.
They're perverts.

39
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,178
They're perverts.

40
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:02,349
Regina is where the Mounties
are. Of course.

41
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:06,312
That's where they train
the Mounties to mount.

42
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:10,524
Every Mountie has to go
through Regina.

43
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:12,192
(laughter)

44
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,988
It's just... it's just
inappropriate, right?

45
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:19,491
Even the most innocent
thing said in Regina

46
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,243
comes across wrong.

47
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,786
Like, I can't ask like,

48
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,581
"Hey, where can a guy
eat out in Regina?"

49
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:26,874
(laughter)

50
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,584
You know?

51
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:33,088
I can't... That's them.
I'm a good Christin man...

52
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:38,344
trying to find out where a guy
can eat out in Regina.

53
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:43,807
Did you know the original name
of Regina

54
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,101
was Pile of Boners?

55
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:48,479
(laughter)

56
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,940
That's gross!

57
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,317
By the way, it's the whole
province.

58
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,904
Saskatchewan? That sounds
like an STD.

59
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,282
"My last boyfriend gave me
Saskatchewan."

60
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,909
"Really?"

61
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:05,621
"Yeah, now I have to take
all this penicillin."

62
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,209
Saskatchewan. You know,
it's cause of Saskatchewan

63
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:14,463
that moose antlers
are called a rack.

64
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,715
Now you can't even give a moose
a compliment,

65
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,468
like "Hey, nice rack!"

66
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,847
"No, lady, I was talking
about the moose."

67
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,101
"Well, then that lady should
know she looks like a moose."

68
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,812
(laughter)

69
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,775
I saw a moose. Have you seen...

70
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,735
I saw a moose in person.

71
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,321
I mean, or in moose.

72
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,908
I'm a person who saw a moose.

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,328
And I tell you, I don't feel
like I was ready.

74
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,957
I don't know how big I thought
a moose was gonna be,

75
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,252
but I was way off.

76
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,087
I was way off.

77
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,423
I was... It was huge.

78
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,259
And I feel like I should have
been warned

79
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:01,653
Like, someone should have
been like,

80
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:04,680
"You might see a moose.
Get ready."

81
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:05,973
But my friend was like,

82
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,367
"You might see a moose.
Have fun."

83
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,518
Like it was a butterfly
or something.

84
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,437
"You'll see a moose."

85
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,105
So I was, like, in shock
when I saw it.

86
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,982
I was like, "Wow! Whoa!

87
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:19,153
"Are they shooing
a Star Wars movie up here?

88
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,532
"How many people are in
that moose costume?

89
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,325
At lease three!"

90
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,910
(laughter)

91
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,914
It was huge. It was the size
of, like, a transformer.

92
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,791
It was gigantic.

93
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,084
And then my friend was like,

94
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,713
"Don't get close,
it'll kill ya."

95
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,174
What?

96
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:43,385
At that moment, I realized
my moose knowledge...

97
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,636
didn't exist.

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,181
I knew nothing about moose.

99
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:51,268
Like, my moose knowledge
comes from cartoons.

100
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,896
In cartoon, moose are like,
"Hey, now you doing?

101
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,731
Da-duh, da-duh, da-duh."

102
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,442
But in real life,
"I'm gonna kill you!"

103
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,865
How did that translate?

104
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,954
You never hear a moose in
those animal songs, right?

105
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,583
♪ The cow goes moo,
the cat goes meow ♪

106
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:18,045
♪ The moose goes "I'm gonna
stomp you to death!" ♪

107
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,255
(laughter)

108
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,305
Did you know that the plural
of moose is Reginas?

109
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,599
(laughter)

110
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,726
That surprised me.

111
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,563
Wasn't ready for that.

112
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:41,401
I performed in
Lethbridge, Alberta.

113
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,530
If you don't know anything about
Lethbridge, don't feel bad.

114
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,199
Neither do people in Lethbridge.

115
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:48,700
I asked them, I was like,

116
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,261
"Hey, what should I know
about Lethbridge?"

117
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,287
and they're like,
"I don't know."

118
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,872
Oh, my God.

119
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,125
"Is there anything I should
know about Lethbridge?"

120
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,210
"Mm...

121
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,712
Calgary's two hours away."

122
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:08,720
Is this, like, a temporary city?

123
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:12,349
Did everyone just show up
a month ago?

124
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,436
"We got, like, a bridge."

125
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,148
A lot of those western
Canadian cities

126
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,024
have a bridge that
they tell you about.

127
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:24,111
"We got the longest
land bridge over

128
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,322
the smallest body of water."

129
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,078
I don't know if you should
brag about that.

130
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:36,456
That-that sounds like a mistake.

131
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,043
An engineering error.

132
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,796
"We got a highway with no exit."

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,882
(laughter)

134
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:50,262
That might be on purpose. Yeah.

135
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:55,142
Kitchner. Kitchner.

136
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,144
Schnitzel.

137
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:02,149
Kitchner, or, as I refer to it,
Berlin.

138
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,693
'Cause Kitchner's very
German, right?

139
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:06,320
Any Germans here?

140
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,030
(low cheering) Yeah?

141
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:12,159
That's about the extent
of German pride.

142
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,119
It helps that we're in the dark.

143
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,541
"I don't want to lose my job."

144
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,591
It's worldwide.
I was in Vienna, Austria,

145
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,010
and they were, like, insistent
that they were not German.

146
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,179
"We're not German.
We're not German.

147
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,014
"We're totally different.

148
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,101
"I mean, we speak German
and-and, you know...

149
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,312
"our culture's German
but, you know...

150
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,773
"in every war we've fought
with Germany but...

151
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,150
we're not German."

152
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,028
I almost believe you.

153
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,322
That's sad.

154
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:53,575
But I stated my Canadian tour
in the Maritimes.

155
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,744
I started in Halifax.

156
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,871
(cheering) Halifax.

157
00:08:57,955 --> 00:09:00,165
The first thing I did is
I ate a donair.

158
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,792
(cheering)

159
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:05,754
And the second thing I did was
have explosive diarrhea.

160
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:07,673
(laughter)

161
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,680
I should have known something
bad was coming.

162
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,115
When I walked in,
the guy was like,

163
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,308
"You don't even look drunk."

164
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,435
(laughter)

165
00:09:22,854 --> 00:09:25,065
I'm not.

166
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,650
"Here you go."

167
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:31,822
Did you know that donair was
started by a Turkish immigrant

168
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,907
who moved to Halifax

169
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,077
and wanted to open
a toilet paper company.

170
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,121
(laughter)

171
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:44,501
It's really a beautiful,
Canadian story.

172
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,962
Really.

173
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,922
Those donairs are amazing.

174
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,258
You know, that...
that spicy meat

175
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,303
with that sweet sauce
which I'm almost positive

176
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,973
is just melted ice cream.

177
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,184
"I'll have a donair.
Make it cookies and cream."

178
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,396
That donair meat.

179
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,149
I still can't find out
what it is.

180
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:12,321
It's like ♪ You know Dancer
and Prancer ♪

181
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:17,034
♪ And donair and Blitzen ♪

182
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:20,454
♪ But do you recall ♪

183
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:25,584
♪ The most tasty
diarrhea-causing meat of all ♪

184
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:29,629
♪ It's the donair ♪

185
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,968
I'm convinced that the donair
was just created

186
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:38,096
so we can digest poutine.

187
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,057
Right?

188
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,226
Some guy went, "I had poutine
a month ago."

189
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,563
The doctor's like, "I'm gonna
prescribe you a donair."

190
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,398
(laughter)

191
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,984
"Is that gonna work?"

192
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:55,447
"I'm also gonna give you
a prescription for a diaper.

193
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,116
"Very important you put
the diaper on

194
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,036
before you eat the donair."

195
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,585
Poutine. Oh, my gosh, poutine.

196
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,755
At this point, are there any
Canadian restaurants

197
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,341
that don't serve poutine?

198
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,177
I picked one up at...
what was it?

199
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,764
It was a Booster Juice.

200
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,266
(laughter)

201
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,687
"Yeah, I'll have the kale
poutine smoothie."

202
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:28,771
(laughter)

203
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,983
It was delicious!

204
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,611
Poutine, I know some of you
pronounce it "pou-ten,"

205
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,905
but you're still saying "poo."

206
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:40,742
(laughter)

207
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:42,160
I love poutine.

208
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,829
And I eat unhealthy,
and some would say,

209
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,082
I've built a career out of
eating unhealthy.

210
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,334
But, you know, poutine?

211
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,962
It's a little irresponsible.

212
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,631
I mean, after all,
I don't wanna die.

213
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,466
(laughter)

214
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,260
It's almost very...

215
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,222
Someone was just tying to make
French fries more unhealthy.

216
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,599
"What if we cover it with
everything

217
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,393
that causes heart disease?"

218
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,562
(laughter)

219
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,398
"Let's do it.
We have free health care."

220
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,651
(laughter, applause)

221
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:23,160
In Edmonton, I had
perogie poutine.

222
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,079
Yeah, yeah, I had to sign
a waiver and everything.

223
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,331
(chuckles)

224
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:32,794
The first food I had to provide
an emergency contact for.

225
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,715
It was delicious, but do we need
perogie poutine?

226
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,758
Has anyone ever eaten poutine
and be like,

227
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,012
"You know what this needs?
Carbs."

228
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,473
(laughter)

229
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:50,645
Poutine.

230
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:53,315
Fascinating. It started
in Quebec, right?

231
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,025
And now it's everywhere
in Canada.

232
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,836
But you know there was probably
a part of Canada

233
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,528
that was like, "Wait a minute.

234
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,532
"As a country, we're going
with the French fry thing?

235
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,952
"Not salmon, or beaver tail?

236
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,788
I guess that's better
than syrup."

237
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:14,878
Did you know that poutine in
French means Vladimir Putin?

238
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:18,840
(laughter)

239
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:20,675
I'm just saying.

240
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,263
I love how poutine is different
in different provinces.

241
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:29,184
Like, in Ottawa, there's
the squeaky cheese

242
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,977
that goes on the poutine, right?

243
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,312
There's the squeaky cheese.

244
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,855
The first time I performed
in Ottawa,

245
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:36,483
it was in April during
a poutine fest,

246
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,443
and I learned later on it was

247
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,196
the second poutine fest
of the year.

248
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,407
(laughter)

249
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,493
Which means sometime in January
or February

250
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,286
someone was at a poutine fest
and was like,

251
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,288
"Why don't we do this
next month?"

252
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,165
(laughter)

253
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:57,128
If it happens every month,
that's not a festival.

254
00:13:57,212 --> 00:14:00,423
That's a habit.

255
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:04,135
Last time I was in Ottawa
was during Winterlude.

256
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,845
(cheering) Winterlude.

257
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,848
Of course a very...
It's an outdoor festival...

258
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,810
in February!

259
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:14,354
Okay.

260
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,374
You know, in America, when
there's horrible weather,

261
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,609
we-we cancel events.

262
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:22,487
You guys kinda plan around 'em.

263
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,448
"Hey, you know how it's
the coldest month of the year?

264
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,617
What if we had a party outside?"

265
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,537
(laughter)

266
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,872
"Uh, why would we do that?"

267
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:37,085
"It could be like an interlude
between the poutine fests."

268
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,421
(laughter)

269
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,594
I have to admit,
I'm a little disappointed

270
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:49,222
by the number of
Tim Hortons in town.

271
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,266
(laughter)

272
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,394
There's some. But you go to
some cities in Canada,

273
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:59,691
and the number of Tim Hortons
is uncomfortable.

274
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:01,943
Like, you drive by
the fifth one and you're like,

275
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:05,322
"Uh, is this a Tim Hortons
theme park?"

276
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,324
(laughter)

277
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,910
"Are we sure they're only
selling coffee and doughnuts?"

278
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,039
Canadians, you guys are
always like,

279
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,709
"That's our Dunkin' Donuts.
That's our Dunkin 'Donuts."

280
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:20,337
Yeah, in America, we don't
have Dunkin' Donuts

281
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,006
on every block.

282
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,176
Tim Hortons is like America's
stop sign.

283
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,888
(laughter, applause)

284
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,810
Now-now I've seen some
Tim Hortons in America,

285
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,646
and whenever I see
a Tim Hortons in America,

286
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,914
I always have this same thought:

287
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,108
Don't force your culture on us.

288
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,653
(laughter) Yeah.

289
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,906
(applause)

290
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,660
But you wouldn't know
how that feels!

291
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,793
Last week, I went to
a Canadian tire store.

292
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,504
I don't wanna brag, uh...

293
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,214
I was kinda surprised
to find out

294
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,549
they sell more than tires.

295
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,260
I don't know why I would think
they'd only sell tires.

296
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:14,265
It's not like the store's
called Canadian Tire.

297
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:16,935
How important are tires
to you people?

298
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,145
(laughter)

299
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:23,900
"You know people love
shopping for tires?

300
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:28,029
"We lure them in with the tires.

301
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:31,658
And then boom,
we sell 'em a blender."

302
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:34,327
(laughter)

303
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,627
Nobody in Canada even
sounds like that guy.

304
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,341
Of course there are differences
between Canada and America.

305
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:52,220
It's not just health care
and bacon.

306
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:56,266
Your airport codes
make no sense.

307
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:59,185
And I love how you're
so proud of them.

308
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,899
"YW-pound sign representing!
Yeah!

309
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:08,111
We're YW-pound sign!"

310
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:13,658
It's weird. Toronto: YYZ.

311
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,910
I don't know why.

312
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:20,081
"Well, it makes sense.
'Y' is, you know, why not.

313
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:25,086
"And then 'Y", the second 'Y',
is why are you askin'.

314
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:30,133
And the the Z is like...
zzzzz you later."

315
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,053
"This guy's a jerk."

316
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,976
Of course, Canada's the home of
the Caesar cocktail.

317
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,146
The Caesar cocktail.
You're very proud of that.

318
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,607
The Caesar is kinda like
a Bloody Mary

319
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,901
but with clam juice

320
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,945
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

321
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,823
Mmm, mmm!

322
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,325
Clam juice, wow.

323
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,119
I didn't know that was
an ingredient.

324
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,747
Or a liquid.

325
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:04,876
"You know that thing
from the ocean

326
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:08,671
"that looks like a snot?

327
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,966
What if we made it into
a juice?"

328
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:16,346
"Think about it.

329
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,808
"Say you just went joggin',
all right?

330
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,851
"You're parched, you're thirsty.

331
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:26,064
"I hand you a tall glass
of clam juice.

332
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,150
"You chug it. Glup, glup, glup.

333
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:34,322
And then we're ready
to go to the club."

334
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,450
"He has never met
a Canadian before."

335
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,494
(laughs)

336
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,955
It has nothing to do...

337
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,415
The Caesar was created
in Calgary,

338
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:49,003
landlocked Calgary,
which has the finest clams.

339
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:52,006
(laughter)

340
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,053
I just love how you guys,
how Canadians...

341
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,889
like, complain about
the Bloody Mary.

342
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,683
You're like, "Oh,
the Bloody Mary..."

343
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:04,686
(gagging)
"Oh, that's so disgusting!

344
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:07,230
That drink that doesn't have
clam juice in it?"

345
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,691
(gagging)

346
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,613
"The clam... Oh!"

347
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,536
We're having an election
in America,

348
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,955
so there's bound to be
some Americans

349
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:27,000
that threaten to move to Canada.

350
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,378
"If that person gets elected,
I'm moving to Canada."

351
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,882
I don't remember Canada
extending an invitation.

352
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,718
(laughter) It's like...

353
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,262
(applause)

354
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,264
And I've been coming
to Canada for years.

355
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,684
Been recruited zero times.

356
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,394
You know? No one's ever gone,

357
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:49,606
"Hey, you live in the States?

358
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:53,276
"You ever thought about
making a move?

359
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,195
How you feel about clam juice?"

360
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:04,329
"He better stop with
the clam jokes.

361
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,498
It's getting too much."

362
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:12,837
In my hotel, there is a youth
hockey team staying there.

363
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,927
There is a youth hockey team
staying in every Canadian hotel.

364
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,387
(laughter)

365
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,640
(applause)

366
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,187
Are they allowed to go home?

367
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,689
How long are these tournaments?

368
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,900
Every hotel!

369
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,402
Every time I'm in an elevator
in a Canadian hotel,

370
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,047
I feel like someone's in
the other room, like,

371
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:41,741
"Send in the kids with the
smelly hockey bags."

372
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,409
(laughter)

373
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,387
"There's not enough room."
"Just do it. Just do it.

374
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,247
Tell him we'll give him
clam juice."

375
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,750
"That better be the last
clam juice joke."

376
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,460
(laughter)

377
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,298
But of course,
the youth hockey league,

378
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,759
that's all about the Canadian
hockey dream, right?

379
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:03,304
You know, parents drive their
children all around Canada

380
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,474
because there's the dream
that maybe their child

381
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,559
might be just, by chance,

382
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:11,270
maybe the next Wayne Gretzky,
right?

383
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:14,148
And I'm here to tell you,
probably not.

384
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,317
(laughter)

385
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:20,363
There's only one Great One,
and I think he lives in Phoenix.

386
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,700
(laughter)

387
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,327
Let's kill him.

388
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,665
I remember the first time
I came to Canada.

389
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:34,460
The big difference I noticed
was that, uh,

390
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,837
things are measured differently.

391
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,714
Temperature and distance.

392
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,816
I remember at the time
being like,

393
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,591
"Well, that's annoying."

394
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,136
And then eventually I realized
it wasn't just Canada,

395
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,763
it was the entire world...

396
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,807
(laughter)

397
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,436
that uses the metric system...

398
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,397
except for us!

399
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,066
And I tell you, it was strange,
as an American,

400
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,278
to realize every other country
on the planet...

401
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,739
was wrong.

402
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,157
Right?

403
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,742
And you should change for us.

404
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,994
'Cause we all know that God
loves America more.

405
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,705
And that love is measured
in feet.

406
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,749
(laughter)

407
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,751
So here's how I can tell.

408
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,003
The way American's measure
things is annoying.

409
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,630
Because occasionally you'll
run into a British person

410
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:22,842
who will announce their
weight in stones.

411
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:26,554
(British accent)
"I'm only 12 stone."

412
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,724
(regular voice) "I'm sorry,
are you a caveman."

413
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,685
(English accent, indistinct)

414
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:41,903
How do the English say "stone"
with a straight face?

415
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,697
How do you condescend
to the entire world

416
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,659
when you're weighing yourself
in boulders?

417
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,661
"We're going to leave the EU

418
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:53,247
and return to our
pebble economy."

419
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:55,792
(laughter)

420
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,797
I do love doing
international shows.

421
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,757
It's different with Trump
as president.

422
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,219
I know you guys are
all fans of his, but...

423
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,054
No, it's different with Trump
as president.

424
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,724
It's kinda like having a parent
that's an alcoholic.

425
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,353
Show up in a country like,
"Sorry about my dad."

426
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:17,313
(laughter)

427
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,275
"We don't know what
to do about it."

428
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,612
(applause)

429
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:29,075
"Trying to get the phone
from him.

430
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:33,246
Proving harder than we thought."

431
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:36,457
I find Canadians are the least
phased by Trump.

432
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,459
Because, you know,
within the world,

433
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,419
you know, it's like...
'cause Canadians,

434
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,672
you know, Trump is just an
exaggeration

435
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,049
of the American stereotype.

436
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,676
Americans are known as
obnoxious.

437
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:49,637
Trump is just
turning up the dial, right?

438
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,140
That's the American stereotype,
obnoxious.

439
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:54,225
The Canadian stereotype? Polite.

440
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:57,019
Which is not a stereotype,
it's a compliment.

441
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,521
But you guys still get angry.

442
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,357
"We're not polite,
we're passive-aggressive."

443
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,776
(laughter)

444
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,197
But what you don't realize,
to an American,

445
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:11,534
passive-aggressive is polite.

446
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,162
But everything about Canada
is pleasant.

447
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,663
Even the Canadian flag.

448
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,124
Most national flags have
all these macho symbols,

449
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,376
like, Mexico's an eagle
eating a snake,

450
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,044
American's the stars and
stripes,

451
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,380
and Canada's is like,
"Just put a leaf up there."

452
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,132
(laughter)

453
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:30,636
"One for every province?"
"No, just one maple leaf."

454
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,431
As a result,
everyone likes Canadians.

455
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,141
Everyone likes Canadians,
you know?

456
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:39,437
Not liking Canadians is an
indication of a mental problem.

457
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,105
(laughter)

458
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,525
"I don't like Canadians
or puppies."

459
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,111
Remember when China was mad
at Canada?

460
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,989
The whole world was like,
"Come on, China."

461
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,034
(laughter)

462
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,454
"That's a red flag.

463
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,748
"Put the star in the middle."

464
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:01,959
"How many flag jokes?"

465
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:07,131
I do feel like the map of Canada
looks unfinished.

466
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,550
It's so detailed on
the east coast,

467
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:12,345
and then it's just
wide open spaces.

468
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,068
It's almost like someone was
working on it

469
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,515
and they fell asleep.

470
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,809
And his boss comes over,
"Are you done?"

471
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,394
"What? Huh?

472
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,814
"Uh, yeah, I just gotta put
some names in the...

473
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:27,109
"Prince Edward Island,
Nova Scotia.

474
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,654
So much land."

475
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,906
(laughter)

476
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,450
"New-found-land."

477
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,869
(laughter)

478
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:38,013
The boss is like,
"Are you done?"

479
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:39,664
"Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm done.

480
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,916
"I'm done, I'm done.

481
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,000
Colombia."

482
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:44,252
"That's a country already."

483
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:46,337
"Uh, British Columbia."

484
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,174
I've been to British Columbia.

485
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,718
It's not very British
or Columbian.

486
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:55,137
(laughter)

487
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,849
Vancouver was like a rainy
Seattle.

488
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,226
Spent a week in Vancouver.

489
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,770
Somehow it rained for two weeks.

490
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:05,731
(laughter)

491
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,442
Boy, you guys had fun naming
things Vancouver

492
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:09,902
out there in British Columbia.

493
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,654
Vancouver Island,
Vancouver City,

494
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,114
which is not on
Vancouver Island,

495
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,241
North Vancouver, West Vancouver,
South Vancouver.

496
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,969
Washington State, you can
have a Vancouver.

497
00:26:16,993 --> 00:26:19,287
Everyone gets a Vancouver,

498
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:22,206
Everyone gets one.

499
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,250
It does appear you guys
struggled

500
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,211
with naming things a little bit.

501
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:30,214
Like Regina.

502
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:32,425
Moose Jaw.

503
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:36,095
Do you want people to
go to these places?

504
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:41,183
Then, of course, there's the
Saint John-St. John's fiasco.

505
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:45,229
(laughter, applause)

506
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,566
Saint John, New Brunswick,

507
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,319
and then right next to it...

508
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:53,738
St. John's, Newfoundland.

509
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,215
I'm saying this like
you don't know.

510
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,616
We know!

511
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:00,578
We live there! We know!

512
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:04,040
It never came up?

513
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,500
Nobody took a boat from
one place to the other?

514
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:10,254
"Hey, that other place has
the same name as this place."

515
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,175
Nobody confronted Newfoundland?

516
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:15,968
Like, "Hey, Newfoundland!

517
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,863
"Saint John, New Brunswick, is
the oldest city in Canada,

518
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,263
so don't use that name."

519
00:27:19,347 --> 00:27:20,806
And Newfoundland said,
"Okay, okay.

520
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,225
Oh, shoot."

521
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,812
"What happened?"
"Nothing. (mumbles)

522
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:30,983
"Our capital is St. John's."

523
00:27:32,193 --> 00:27:33,652
"That's the same name."

524
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:35,154
"No, no, it's different.

525
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,989
"You spell out Saint and ours
is just St.,

526
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,158
so it could stand for street."

527
00:27:41,494 --> 00:27:44,663
"Does yours stand for street?"
"No, it stands for saint."

528
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,999
"But ours ends with
and apostrophe S,

529
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,542
"so it's possessive.

530
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,753
"So when St. John comes back,
he's gonna go,

531
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:52,588
'Where do I go?'"

532
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,633
He's gonna go to the Virgin
Islands. Who are we kidding?

533
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,514
I think it's fascinating
that there's a part of Canada

534
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:06,435
called the Northwest
Territories... still...

535
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,895
today.

536
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:11,232
I wasn't looking at a map
from the 1600s

537
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:14,151
or watching an episode
of "Deadwood."

538
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,407
Name your country!

539
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,243
(laughs) Northwest...

540
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,538
There are people that live
there.

541
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,957
What kind of civic pride...

542
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,459
"Well, where we're from in
the Northwest Territories,

543
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:34,630
"or as we call ourselves
the Northwest Terratorians.

544
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,258
Go terra."

545
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,427
How dismissive!

546
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,053
How...

547
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,597
Like the Northwest Territories,
"Can we be a province?"

548
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,642
"No!

549
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,979
You may not!"

550
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:54,233
"How about a territory
or a yard?

551
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:58,612
How about Northwest
Storage Area?"

552
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,535
The Northwest Territories
are smaller,

553
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,204
'cause in the '90s,
the Inuit people were like,

554
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,039
"We'd like our own territories."

555
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:10,749
And the Canadian government
was like,

556
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,587
"Oh, we didn't even know
people live there."

557
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,341
"Sure, sure. What do you want
your territories to be called?"

558
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,802
"Uh, none of it."

559
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,309
"Are you gonna tell them or..."

560
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:33,272
"It's a great name.

561
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:36,066
"Great name.
None of it. Love it.

562
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,693
"Uh, sorry for stealing
all the land.

563
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,779
Anyway, we got a hockey game
we're watching, so..."

564
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:47,244
I think it's strange...

565
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,163
Canada, it starts off...

566
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:54,001
The further east you go,
the crazier it gets.

567
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:57,796
Like, Newfoundland is like
bwa bwa bwa bwa.

568
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,508
Bwa bwa bwa bwa bwa.

569
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:03,427
Newfoundland is, like,
the crazy uncle

570
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:07,014
that you don't introduce
to friends...

571
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,600
until you've known them
for a long time.

572
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:13,020
"I don't want them
to think I'm like them."

573
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,106
Everything is crazy
in Newfoundland. Everything.

574
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,317
It's like, "Newfoundland,

575
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,737
do you wanna be in the same
time zone as the Maritimes?"

576
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,949
"We'll go a half hour earlier."

577
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,372
Uh...

578
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:36,669
"Worldwide, time zones are
done by the hour."

579
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,965
"We'll go half hour."

580
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:52,101
"Okay. Okay. Just final
housekeeping here. Um...

581
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:55,396
Is Newfoundland three words
or two words?"

582
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,400
"One word."

583
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,697
"Thank you very much.
Thank you."

584
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,743
Cause it's... Canada starts
off pretty normal

585
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,287
on the west coast.

586
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,289
British Columbia, you know,
it's like,

587
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,374
beautiful, natural resources,

588
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,251
they shoot TV shows
and movies there.

589
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,628
That's like your California,
right?

590
00:31:19,712 --> 00:31:23,007
And then there's...
There Alberta,

591
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,010
where it's like oil and cowboys.
That's like your Texas.

592
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,511
And then there's Saskatchewan,

593
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:30,472
which we have established
are all perverts.

594
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,225
Looks like I'm not performing
in Saskatchewan again.

595
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:36,687
And then there's...
Then there's Manitoba.

596
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:41,775
Manitoba's like that friend
you invite last to the party.

597
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:45,529
And only 'cause you forgot
they existed.

598
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,531
(laughter)

599
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:49,742
Canada picks on Winnipeg, right?

600
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,577
That was kind of a big...

601
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,330
I remember I was in Toronto,
and I was going to Winnipeg

602
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,081
and it was my first show there,

603
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,583
and everyone in Toronto
was like,

604
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,919
"Oh, bring a...
Bring a coat! Ha ha!

605
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,380
"Winnipeg! (laughs)

606
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:06,925
Hope you like cold weather!
(laughs)"

607
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:12,014
Uh, I'm not sleeping outside.

608
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,685
Then I got to Winnipeg
and I was like,

609
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:20,481
they're right, they're right.

610
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,442
They nailed it.

611
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:27,112
I went to Winnipeg in February.

612
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:30,324
(audience groans)
That's when you wanna go.

613
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:33,619
It was 50 below!

614
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,579
50! By the way, at that point,

615
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:38,874
it doesn't matter if it's
Celsius or Fahrenheit.

616
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:42,586
It's kind of like hell.
It's just bad.

617
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,673
And you forget how cold it is,

618
00:32:45,756 --> 00:32:47,716
and then you step outside
and you're like, "Oh!"

619
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,386
And that's why your national
anthem starts that way.

620
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,806
It's like, "Oh! Canada!"

621
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,183
(applause)

622
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:01,939
I'm convinced half of you
don't know the rest of the words.

623
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,899
♪ O Canada ♪

624
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:08,487
♪ The pipes, the pipes
are calling ♪

625
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,032
(mumbled singing)

626
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:13,867
People were so nice in Winnipeg.

627
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,287
It was freezing, and they kept
apologizing for the weather.

628
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,957
They were like, "Sorry it's so
cold. Sorry it's so cold."

629
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,460
I'm like, I'm almost positive
it's not your fault.

630
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,587
(laughter)

631
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,965
But they kept apologizing.
"Sorry about the weather."

632
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,466
Eventually I was like,

633
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,468
"Did you not pay a bill
of something?"

634
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,929
(laughter)

635
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,224
"Weather work different
up here?"

636
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,393
I was in Winnipeg for two days.

637
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:42,146
I kept running into people
from the Philippines.

638
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:44,249
I learned later on a lot
of people from the Philippines

639
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:45,899
have immigrated to Winnipeg.

640
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,377
I know nothing about
the Philippines

641
00:33:47,401 --> 00:33:50,362
except that it's a tropical
paradise...

642
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:54,032
which Winnipeg is not.

643
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:56,201
Which brings up the question,

644
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:59,538
how bad are things
in the Philippines?

645
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:03,333
You're moving to Winnipeg!

646
00:34:03,417 --> 00:34:05,544
"You really wanna move?"
"I gotta get out of here!"

647
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,439
"Would you move to a place
where you can't go outside?"

648
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:08,881
"I'll go."

649
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,258
"All right, grab your
flip-flops, let's go."

650
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,013
I can say that joke 'cause
I'm from the Philippines.

651
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,724
(laughter)

652
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:24,813
Manitoba, then you go east,
and then there's Ontario, right?

653
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,106
(cheering) Ontario.

654
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,733
There's that province pride.

655
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,902
Ontario. And then there's
Quebec.

656
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:33,071
Ontario and Quebec.
Those are like the two brothers

657
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,616
that run the family business...

658
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,161
after the parents died.

659
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,080
But they had different mothers.

660
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:44,833
(laughter)

661
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:46,752
Right?

662
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:49,755
(applause)

663
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:53,467
Ontario's like,
"I'll handle this."

664
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,969
Quebec is like,
"You are so idiot."

665
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:58,013
(laughter)

666
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,434
Quebec is just so fascinating.

667
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,561
Canada's slightly different,
slightly different,

668
00:35:04,645 --> 00:35:06,080
then it gets to Quebec
and it's like...

669
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,607
different language!

670
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,276
What?!

671
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,569
Six million French-speaking...

672
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:15,072
It's a French-speaking province!

673
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,032
Or a Francophone!

674
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,661
"Are you Francophone
or Anglophone?"

675
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:24,706
Like they're competing
cellular companies.

676
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,876
"Are you on the Francophone
family plan?"

677
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,546
"I'm thinking of switching
to the Anglophone."

678
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:36,218
That's gotta be hard
for the Quebecois, right?

679
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,303
You know, they're Canadian,

680
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,597
which, by definition,
is almost polite,

681
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:43,308
but they're also French.

682
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:47,020
(laughter)

683
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,439
Talk about a contradiction.

684
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,209
(French accent) "I want to
apologize for everything,

685
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,151
but I'm better than everyone."

686
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:55,779
(laughter)

687
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,450
"I am sorry you're so dumb."

688
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,369
(laughter)

689
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,417
I spent some time in Quebec.
I love Quebec.

690
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,544
My favorite part of
the Quebecois culture

691
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,463
is the curse words.

692
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:16,341
The curse words in Quebec
are just

693
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:20,095
Catholic objects in French.

694
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:25,183
(speaking mock French)

695
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:27,978
They're just saying nouns.

696
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,772
"You're a chair."

697
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:33,525
"Well, then you're a table."

698
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:36,445
"Fellas, fellas, there's
children present."

699
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:44,119
East of Quebec is, uh,
New Brunswick, right?

700
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,495
New Brunswick and the Maritimes,

701
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,331
that's the home of
the Acadians, right?

702
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:50,542
The Acadians. Those noble,
brave people

703
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:53,754
that the English kicked out
during the Great Expulsion.

704
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,380
They kicked them out of
the Maritimes,

705
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,341
and they sent some of them
to Louisiana,

706
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:58,926
and some of them to
the West Indies.

707
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:02,846
And a brave amount, a few,
fought their way back

708
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:07,225
to return to the coldest place
on Earth.

709
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:10,646
There's like a million French
speakers in New Brunswick.

710
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,105
So there's-there's...

711
00:37:12,189 --> 00:37:14,566
One in five Canadians
speaks French.

712
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:16,568
So there was this great
compromise

713
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:20,405
where the English speakers
agreed to take French in school,

714
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:24,326
and the French speakers agreed
to continue speaking French.

715
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,870
(laughter)

716
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,877
Of course, there are Canadians
who speak English and French,

717
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:36,672
and they're called
flight attendants.

718
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:40,467
(laughter)

719
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,344
Whenever I'm on
an Air Canada flight,

720
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,762
I'm always like, oh, good.

721
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:46,640
Now I can ignore the same
message twice.

722
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:52,020
"Jim, you're a jerk."

723
00:37:56,483 --> 00:38:00,195
I suppose the most famous
Canadian right now is Drake.

724
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,031
Right? I saw Drake in concert
a couple months ago.

725
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,218
I bet you wouldn't even think
I would be friends with Drake.

726
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,536
But guess what? I'm not.

727
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,246
(laughter)

728
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:11,415
But I did see Drake in concert.

729
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:13,750
I had two shows in Las Vegas
in the same night,

730
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,419
and after the second show,

731
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,896
the promoter came up to me
and he goes,

732
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,464
"Hey, Jim, Drake is doing
a special show

733
00:38:19,548 --> 00:38:21,466
"here in a nightclub in
the casino.

734
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,344
Would you like to go
and feel uncomfortable?"

735
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:27,472
(laughter)

736
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:29,141
And I just finished
my second show.

737
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:30,493
It was like 11:30,
and I was like,

738
00:38:30,517 --> 00:38:32,644
"You know what?
I wanna go. I wanna go.

739
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,396
"I might not be a Drake expert,

740
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,897
"but I have friends that
like Drake.

741
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,483
"Well, my six-year-old
Patrick likes Drake.

742
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,485
So I wanna impress Patrick."

743
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:42,571
So the promoter took Ted and I,

744
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,157
and he escorted is through
the casino to the nightclub

745
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,325
where all these Drake fans were
waiting to go in.

746
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,886
They all look at me like,
"Oh, my gosh.

747
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,412
There's Drake's accountant."

748
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,039
(laughter)

749
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:55,584
Brought us in the club
and set us up at a table,

750
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,377
and they got us drinks
and everything.

751
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,063
They're like, "Do you need
anything else?"

752
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,797
And I was like, "When does
Drake go on?"

753
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:03,133
And they're like "2:30."
And I was like, "Cool.

754
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:05,469
Can I get a wake-up call?"

755
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:07,220
(laughter)

756
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,104
'Cause it was probably midnight
at this point.

757
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:11,725
So I had to decide. Do I wait
two and a half hours

758
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:15,228
to see one of the biggest
musicians of today?

759
00:39:15,312 --> 00:39:19,733
Who I, personally,
knew one of his songs.

760
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:22,694
Or do I go back to
my room and sleep?

761
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,405
And I just figured,
God's plan, right?

762
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:28,200
God's plan.

763
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,577
So I spent the next
two and a half hours

764
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,913
hanging around these
drunk Drake fans,

765
00:39:32,996 --> 00:39:34,748
trying to stay awake.

766
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,459
After an hour, I realized
Drake is just a combination

767
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:41,213
of the words "drunk"
and "awake." Drake.

768
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,548
(laughter)

769
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:48,470
2:30 finally came. No Drake.

770
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,806
Around 2:45, I was like,

771
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,475
"Did Drake pick up a shift
at Tim Hortons?"

772
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:56,937
(laughter)

773
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,772
Drake finally went on
at 3:00 A.M.

774
00:39:58,855 --> 00:40:01,066
I don't know. Maybe he slept in.

775
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:02,526
3:00 A.M.!

776
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,611
You know, if you're even out
at 3:00 A.M.,

777
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,906
you've made a couple
bad decisions.

778
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:12,536
That's when Drake starts work!

779
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:14,704
And I work at night. I like
working at night.

780
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:16,957
And generally, the later
a job starts,

781
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,583
the more appealing.

782
00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:20,210
But 3:00 A.M.?

783
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:23,630
Drake might as well be hosting
the "Today Show."

784
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,716
He could fill in for
Savannah Guthrie.

785
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,427
Drake did an hour show.

786
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,804
He performed from 3:00 to 4:00.

787
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:33,265
I learned later on he was
paid $2 million

788
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,558
for that one hour of work.

789
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:37,310
So we make the same.

790
00:40:37,394 --> 00:40:39,729
(laughter)

791
00:40:39,813 --> 00:40:41,106
The show ended at 4:00,

792
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,816
and I started walking
back to my room.

793
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,276
4:00 A.M. in Vegas,

794
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,111
which is 7:00 A.M. here on
the East Coast,

795
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,445
and I live in New York,

796
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,447
so it's like 7:00 A.M.
in New York,

797
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:51,992
and 9:13 in Newfoundland.

798
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,619
(laughter)

799
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,997
But I was walking back,
and I was like,

800
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,665
it's 7:00 A.M., I should
just call home.

801
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,208
So I called him,
my wife answered,

802
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,644
and she was like, "What are
you doing awake?"

803
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,378
and I'm like, "It's a long
story.

804
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,964
"Is Patrick," our six-ear-old,
"is he awake?"

805
00:41:06,047 --> 00:41:07,692
And she put Patrick on the
phone, and I'm like,

806
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,467
"Patrick, you're not gonna
believe

807
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:12,429
who I just saw in concert.
I saw Drake."

808
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:15,015
And Patrick said, "Who's Drake?"

809
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,975
(laughter)

810
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,644
So, it was worth it.
It was totally worth it.

811
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:22,647
(laughter, applause)

812
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:26,026
All right, that is all for me.
Thank you so much for coming.

813
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:28,111
(cheers and applause)

814
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,946
(music)

815
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:45,086
John: It's great to be here
in New Brunswick.

816
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,966
I can connect with my
Acadian roots.

817
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,135
My Acadian roots.

818
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:56,056
Today I had poutine rapee.

819
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:59,267
I had some putine rappee.

820
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:01,269
And, uh...

821
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:06,066
Uh, it was, uh, you know,

822
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:07,692
it tasted a little bit like

823
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:11,112
there was a flavor expulsion,
too.

824
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:15,200
Um...

825
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:17,535
Oh.

826
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,708
No, I have not eaten many
mashed potato baseballs.

827
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,335
Um...

828
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:31,549
But, uh...

829
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:36,388
That was my least favorite
of them.

830
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,931
Um...

831
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,809
But it is so fascinating.
The Acadian culture.

832
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:43,853
Such a proud, interesting
tradition.

833
00:42:43,937 --> 00:42:47,774
You know, I also...
I tried some dulse.

834
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:49,859
Some dulse, which was...

835
00:42:49,943 --> 00:42:53,571
That was great chewing tobacco.

836
00:42:53,655 --> 00:42:55,740
And I was like, oh, this is
probably

837
00:42:55,824 --> 00:42:57,242
gonna taste like seaweed.

838
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:00,370
And it was worse.

839
00:43:01,871 --> 00:43:05,417
"This guy's just... He's a jerk."

840
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,753
Bumpton's a great city.

841
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:10,463
When I was in Saint John
yesterday,

842
00:43:10,547 --> 00:43:14,509
I saw the Reversing Falls.

843
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,136
I was like "Wow." I mean, I...

844
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:17,429
You know, I don't know...

845
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,014
I mean, I wasn't expecting much.

846
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,682
You know what I mean?

847
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:26,146
I wasn't expecting that
movie "Avatar."

848
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:29,232
But I didn't think it would be

849
00:43:29,316 --> 00:43:31,985
less impressive than
a toilet flushing.

850
00:43:35,447 --> 00:43:39,826
"This guy is a jerk!"

851
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,912
"He's a jerk who's done
research."

852
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,419
I was invited to go sliding,
which was exciting.

853
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:54,090
I turned them down because
I'm an adult.

854
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:57,886
And, uh, I call it sledding.

855
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:03,433
Sliding, for me, is something
you do on accident.

856
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:07,812
Or what a drunk person
would call sledding.

857
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,774
"Do you wanna go sliding?

858
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:15,028
Slipping. You wanna get
injured?"

859
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:18,948
Do you wanna get injured?"

860
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:22,702
You guys call sliding...

861
00:44:22,786 --> 00:44:25,121
You call sledding sliding,

862
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:28,458
but you slide on a sled.

863
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:32,045
But you sled on a skidoo.

864
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,759
All right. Okay. Sure.

865
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:41,346
Sure. And the Americans
are weird. Okay.

866
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:42,931
(laughs)

867
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:46,559
(rock version of "O Canada"
playing)

868
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,583
