in the emergency room.</font>

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,393
<font color=#0080C0>That's what Filipinos do.

00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,775
<font color=#0080C0>And if you're sitting at home,
and you're watching this,</font>

<font color=#0080C0>you're gonna love this show
because we're gonna give you</font>

39
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:36,531
<font color=#0080C0>an all-expense-paid, first-class ticket
to the Philippines,</font>

40
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,159

42
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,873
<font color=#0080C0>Here's a fun fact for you.
I know a lot of people don't know this,</font>

43
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,500
<font color=#0080C0>but the Philippines is separated
by 7,000 islands.</font>

44
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,751
<font color=#0080C0>Seven thousand islands.</font>

45
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,296
<font color=#0080C0>And they speak about 187 languages.</font>

46
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:55,842
<font color=#0080C0>One hundred and eighty-seven languages!</font>

47
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,136
<font color=#0080C0>-Did you get that in your head?
-<font color=#808080>[crowd]</font> Yes!</font>

48
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,014
<font color=#0080C0>But there's one language
you all speak fluently.</font>

49
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:04,517
<font color=#0080C0>Karaoke. And that's fucking Japanese!</font>

50
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,857
<font color=#0080C0>So I guess it's 188 languages.</font>

51
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,278
<font color=#0080C0>Entertainment is in our blood.
My sister sang and I danced.</font>

52
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,197
<font color=#0080C0>I know what you guys are thinking.
"You danced?"</font>

53
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,573
<font color=#0080C0>Yes, I used to dance.</font>

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,242
<font color=#0080C0>I'm an OG B-boy from the '80s, man.</font>

56
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,998
<font color=#0080C0>I still remember back in the day when
I used to do the moonwalk at talent shows.</font>

57
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,001
<font color=#0080C0>And when my mom found out
I could impersonate Michael Jackson,</font>

58
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,795
<font color=#0080C0>it was the best day
and the worst day of my life.</font>

59
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,963
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

60
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,925
<font color=#0080C0>Best day, because my mom was like,
<font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> "Oh! You have talent."</font>

61
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,177
<font color=#0080C0>It was the worst day
'cause my mom was like,</font>

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,054

64
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,809

I could dance like Michael Jackson,</font>

65
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,271
<font color=#0080C0>she made me do it
every time someone came to the house.</font>

66
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,399
<font color=#0080C0>Every time.
It didn't matter who was at the house.</font>

73
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,630
<font color=#0080C0>She made me do Michael Jackson
my whole life</font>

74
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,299
<font color=#0080C0>and then it just got to the point
where I was done.</font>

75
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,551
<font color=#0080C0>I'm not gonna do the Michael Jackson

124
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,061
<font color=#0080C0>Six, eight. And boom, boom, ba.</font>

125
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,604
<font color=#0080C0>Four.</font>

126
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,689
<font color=#0080C0>Eight.</font>

127
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,192
<font color=#0080C0>Two. Nice.</font>

128
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,947
<font color=#0080C0>-<font color=#808080>[Ronnie]</font> All right.
-This is what it's all about. Right here.</font>

129
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,990
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> I've known Ronnie 20 years.</font>

130
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,868
<font color=#0080C0>Two kids in Vegas and now look at us.</font>

131
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,162
<font color=#0080C0>Yes. It's kind of like a clumsy run.</font>

132
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,873
<font color=#0080C0>Instead of running this way,
you're running this way.</font>

133
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,835
<font color=#0080C0>One more time. Let's do it.</font>

134
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,712
<font color=#808080>[upbeat break dancing music
continues to play]</font>

135
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,357
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Ronnie]</font> Yeah! Ha-ha!</font>

136
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,276
<font color=#0080C0>Let's take a little break.</font>

137
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,236
<font color=#808080>[upbeat music playing]</font>

138
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,029
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Ronnie]</font> Just giving feedback,</font>

139
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,407
<font color=#0080C0>just think about all the moves you do
as a picture.</font>

140
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,950
<font color=#0080C0>That's how you know if you're clean.</font>

141
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,494
<font color=#0080C0>When people rush their moves,
you don't see what they're doing.</font>

142
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,497
<font color=#0080C0>You think you're hitting it, but,
you know, when you start getting tired,</font>

143
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,042
<font color=#0080C0>you're not exaggerating these movements,
so when I'm saying double knee boom...</font>

144
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,586
<font color=#0080C0>grab your head.</font>

145
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,130
<font color=#0080C0>Grab your chest. Foot. Foot.</font>

146
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,132
<font color=#0080C0>So pay attention to those details,</font>

147
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,718
<font color=#0080C0>'cause that's what makes
these moments count.</font>

148
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:53,598
<font color=#0080C0>I feel privileged and honored to be here.
You guys learn fast, you guys pick it up,</font>

149
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,558
<font color=#0080C0>and you guys have that style,
which is dope.</font>

150
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,686
<font color=#0080C0>Filipino B-boys, we're all about style,
right, and intricacy.</font>

151
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,897
<font color=#0080C0>And having original moves.</font>

152
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,233
<font color=#0080C0>And I can see that in every single
one of you guys. Shit's tight.</font>

153
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,151
<font color=#0080C0>Props.</font>

154
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,654
<font color=#0080C0>Hats off to you guys.
You guys killed it.</font>

155
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,076
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> About to see some real cypher.
This is a real cypher.</font>

156
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,829
<font color=#0080C0>They're all coming out running.
This is how they claim it.</font>

157
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,915
<font color=#0080C0>This is how you get your name
in the B-boy world,</font>

158
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,291
<font color=#0080C0>coming after someone like Ronnie.</font>

159
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,751
<font color=#0080C0>Watch this.</font>

160
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,336
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Ronnie]</font> Get that shit.</font>

161
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,546
<font color=#0080C0>Killed it, bro. Killed it.</font>

162
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,633
<font color=#0080C0>-I’m B-boy representing Paranaque
-Okay.</font>

163
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,343
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[man]</font> I live here in the Philippines.</font>

164
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,179
<font color=#0080C0>I’m a poor B-boy. I live in a jeepney.</font>

165
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,183
<font color=#0080C0>-I also teach the kids to not use drugs.
-Yeah.</font>

166
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,269
<font color=#0080C0>-Yeah.
-I teach the kids to change their lives.</font>

167
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,771
<font color=#0080C0>That's amazing, man.</font>

168
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,025
<font color=#0080C0>-I got you, bro.
-I'm a B-boy representing Paranaque.</font>

169
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,361
<font color=#808080>[upbeat break-dancing music playing]</font>

170
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,279
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Ronnie]</font> Woo-hoo! Smooth.</font>

171
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,118
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Ronnie]</font> Get it, Mouse.</font>

172
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:04,460
<font color=#0080C0>This is real fucking B-boy shit
right here.</font>

173
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,803
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> Hey, let's go!</font>

174
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,184
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> Whoa. Oh, my God.</font>

175
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,563
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Ronnie]</font> Yeah!</font>

176
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,528
<font color=#0080C0>-It's real, yo.
-That's what I'm talking about.</font>

177
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,076
<font color=#0080C0>This is unexpected. I did not expect
that many dancers to show up.</font>

178
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,244
<font color=#0080C0>It was crazy.</font>

179
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,164
<font color=#0080C0>Some of them were actually from the city
where my family's from. From Iloilo.</font>

180
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,000
<font color=#0080C0>From Pangasinan.</font>

181
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:48,629
<font color=#0080C0>It's humbling to know that they came
all the way out here for this workshop.</font>

182
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,880
<font color=#0080C0>You weren't expecting that?</font>

183
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,173
<font color=#0080C0>-Not at all.
-They were amazing.</font>

184
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,300
<font color=#0080C0>And they were killing it.</font>

185
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,012
<font color=#0080C0>My favorite story from the cypher
is this one B-boy came out,</font>

186
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,390
<font color=#0080C0>and he was like, "I live in a jeepney,
but this is what I do.</font>

187
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,269
<font color=#0080C0>I B-boy. I teach kids to B-boy
and keep them off drugs.</font>

188
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,605
<font color=#0080C0>And now I'm battling Ronnie."</font>

189
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,399
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> Like, he's seen you on YouTube</font>

190
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:12,194
<font color=#0080C0>and that inspires him to try
and get other kids to stay off drugs</font>

191
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,654
<font color=#0080C0>and dance. That's deep.</font>

192
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,072
<font color=#0080C0>-Humbling.
-<font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> It's what you do.</font>

193
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,825
<font color=#0080C0>I mean...
I have family that lives in Tenement.</font>

194
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,412
<font color=#0080C0>-And I've visited them.
-<font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> Yeah.</font>

195
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:23,372
<font color=#0080C0>And to be here, it's like...</font>

196
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,958
<font color=#0080C0>-I know.
-This is where we're from, man.</font>

197
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,836
<font color=#0080C0>-This is our bloodline.
-Yeah. 100%.</font>

198
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,921
<font color=#0080C0>It's humbling.
It's a big honor to be here.</font>

199
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,465
<font color=#0080C0>Look at this environment.</font>

200
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,091
<font color=#0080C0>-This will humble you.
-Yep.</font>

201
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,093
<font color=#0080C0>This goes to show you can do anything.</font>

202
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:39,221
<font color=#0080C0>No matter what your situation is,
you can do it.</font>

203
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,223
<font color=#808080>[crowd cheers and claps]</font>

204
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,976
<font color=#808080>[same upbeat break-dancing song plays]</font>

205
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,850
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> Yes!</font>

206
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,567
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> Yes!</font>

207
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,782
<font color=#0080C0>Are you kidding me?
Right there, that's Ronnie.</font>

208
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,785
<font color=#0080C0>I want everyone to know
I've known Ronnie since he was 17.</font>

209
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:11,332
<font color=#0080C0>I used to book comedy shows,
and he used to perform at my comedy shows.</font>

210
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:15,252
<font color=#0080C0>So it's just fucking crazy
that two Filipinos from 20 years ago</font>

211
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,463
<font color=#0080C0>are now doing the same thing
that they love to do</font>

212
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,549
<font color=#0080C0>right here in the motherland,
in the Philippines, man.</font>

213
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,718
<font color=#0080C0>How crazy is that?</font>

214
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,680
<font color=#0080C0>This is what's even more crazy.
That we were in The Tenement</font>

215
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,600
<font color=#0080C0>and these kids actually knew Ronnie
from the Internet.</font>

216
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,436
<font color=#0080C0>These kids that live in The Tenement
can go on YouTube</font>

217
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,648
<font color=#0080C0>and find another Filipino B-boy
from across the world</font>

218
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,068
<font color=#0080C0>and, next thing you know, they're dancing
together. That shit is beautiful to me.</font>

219
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,820
<font color=#0080C0>You couldn't do that when I was a kid.</font>

220
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:45,366
<font color=#0080C0>I couldn't go online in 1989. Are you
kidding? You know how hard it was for me?</font>

221
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,454
<font color=#0080C0>Do you know how hard it was for me
to find another Filipino comic in 1989</font>

222
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,622
<font color=#0080C0>without the Internet?</font>

223
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:56,085
<font color=#0080C0>Do you know how hard it was for me
to just find another Filipino in 1989?</font>

224
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,044
<font color=#0080C0>It was hard.</font>

225
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,589
<font color=#0080C0>That's why I wore the Filipino flag
on my chest when I did The Tonight Show.</font>

226
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,593
<font color=#0080C0>People ask me, "Why did you wear that flag
on your chest on the The Tonight Show?"</font>

227
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,264
<font color=#0080C0>Because I wanted other Filipino kids
that wanted to be a comic</font>

228
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,099
<font color=#0080C0>to be inspired
when they saw me that night.</font>

229
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,894
<font color=#0080C0>If they saw me that night, they would be
like, "Yo, I can do that, too."</font>

230
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,357
<font color=#0080C0>That's the only reason
why I wore it that night.</font>

231
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,069
<font color=#0080C0>Actually, there is one other reason
why I wore it that night.</font>

232
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,115
<font color=#0080C0>Because the night after
I taped The Tonight Show, the day after,</font>

233
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,325
<font color=#0080C0>there was a journeyman fighter,</font>

234
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,287
<font color=#0080C0>a Filipino journeyman fighter
by the name of Manny Pacquiao...</font>

235
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,708
<font color=#0080C0>He was fighting Antonio Barrera.
This guy was knocking everybody out.</font>

236
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,544
<font color=#0080C0>There was no way Manny
could have won that fight. No way.</font>

237
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,005
<font color=#0080C0>If you had bet the house on Manny
that night,</font>

238
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,007
<font color=#0080C0>you'd still be spending that money today.</font>

239
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,508
<font color=#0080C0>He wasn't supposed to win.</font>

240
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,595
<font color=#0080C0>And the whole world watched.
And I couldn't wait to watch.</font>

241
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:52,433
<font color=#0080C0>I was like, "Yes, finally, there's gonna
be a Filipino at the top of his game</font>

242
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,143
<font color=#0080C0>getting ready to represent the Filipinos."</font>

243
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,353
<font color=#0080C0>I couldn't wait. Everyone was watching it.</font>

244
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,355
<font color=#0080C0>Hundreds of millions of people
watched that fight.</font>

245
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,691
<font color=#0080C0>And then he won.</font>

246
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:02,902
<font color=#0080C0>He fucking won.</font>

247
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,279
<font color=#808080>[crowd cheering and clapping]</font>

248
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,573
<font color=#0080C0>He won.</font>

249
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,368
<font color=#0080C0>And I remember just watching it,
like, "Oh, my God, he won."</font>

250
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:14,288
<font color=#0080C0>It was amazing.</font>

251
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,916
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause I knew that was the day...</font>

252
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,002
<font color=#0080C0>that hundreds of millions of people...</font>

253
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,381
<font color=#0080C0>were gonna hear
the thickest Filipino accent ever.</font>

254
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,966
<font color=#0080C0>It was so fucking thick.</font>

255
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:31,597
<font color=#0080C0>It was the thickest Filipino accent,
and I was so happy.</font>

256
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,975
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
"That's my fucking accent right there."</font>

257
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,436
<font color=#0080C0>I remember that interview
like it was yesterday.</font>

258
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,105
<font color=#0080C0>They were like, "So, Manny,
how did you prepare to fight Barrera?"</font>

259
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,358
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> He was like,
"Well, you know, the...</font>

260
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,276
<font color=#0080C0>When he was, you know...</font>

261
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,280
<font color=#0080C0>He punched like that
and he went like that, I go like that.</font>

262
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,951
<font color=#0080C0>And then he hit me.
I look at him, I punch him back.</font>

263
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,703
<font color=#0080C0>He goes like that and then he...</font>

264
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,372
<font color=#0080C0>he, uh...</font>

265
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,540
<font color=#0080C0>he... you know, he...</font>

266
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,835
<font color=#0080C0>he, uh... Jesus Christ.</font>

267
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,055
<font color=#0080C0>But I will say this, man.
I was proud of Manny.</font>

268
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,140
<font color=#0080C0>Because he spoke English.</font>

269
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,060
<font color=#0080C0>And I'm not trying to be funny.</font>

270
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:21,605
<font color=#0080C0>That was the first time
the world got to see a Filipino accent,</font>

271
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:25,651
<font color=#0080C0>and I was proud of Manny that day.
And no disrespect to Antonio Barrera,</font>

272
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,570
<font color=#0080C0>no matter how many times
he won the championship,</font>

273
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,156
<font color=#0080C0>he always spoke Spanish.
He's supposed to 'cause he's Mexican.</font>

274
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,994
<font color=#0080C0>But that night, Manny said,
"I'm speaking English."</font>

275
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,038
<font color=#0080C0>I fucking applaud him for that.</font>

276
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,457
<font color=#0080C0>That's amazing.</font>

277
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,502
<font color=#0080C0>That was his moment,
and he knew he shocked the fucking world.</font>

278
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,422
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> "I'm going to talk
the best I can</font>

279
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,465

280
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,717
<font color=#0080C0>And that's what he did.</font>

281
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,218
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs and cheers]</font>

282
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,762
<font color=#0080C0>I remember HBO Sports
gave him an interpreter.</font>

283
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,014
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

284
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:55,973
<font color=#0080C0>That's the truth.</font>

285
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,392
<font color=#0080C0>Look at that. Look back.
They gave him an interpreter.</font>

286
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,894
<font color=#0080C0>I remember when Manny Pacquiao
was done talking, they went,</font>

287
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,021
<font color=#0080C0>"Thank you so much, Manny."</font>

288
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,606
<font color=#0080C0>Then they went to the interpreter
and went, "What did he say?"</font>

289
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,484
<font color=#0080C0>And the interpreter was like,
"He's speaking English!</font>

290
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:08,944
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

291
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,863
<font color=#0080C0>You don't understand
what the fuck he's saying?</font>

292
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,907
<font color=#0080C0>Everything he's saying, I'm saying it,
too. You don't understand that?</font>

293
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,826
<font color=#0080C0>You don't understand "Jesus Christ"?</font>

294
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,412
<font color=#0080C0>Really? This motherfucker is crazy!</font>

295
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,497
<font color=#0080C0>Son of a shit, you. Fuck you, huh."</font>

296
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,003
<font color=#0080C0>Nowadays,
there are a lot more opportunities</font>

297
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,840
<font color=#0080C0>for Filipino-American comics
to get on stage and perform.</font>

298
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,885
<font color=#0080C0>But a lot of them
haven't come back to the motherland.</font>

00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,303
<font color=#0080C0>Check this out.</font>

00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:42,644
<font color=#0080C0>We've been here for two hours.</font>

302
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,521
<font color=#0080C0>I kind of just feel like</font>

00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:49,276
<font color=#0080C0>either, A, they forgot about us
or, B, we're in the wrong city.</font>

<font color=#0080C0>Oh, man. My stomach's hurting.</font>

-<font color=#808080>[Andrew]</font> What?</font>

-<font color=#808080>[Andrew]</font> First time.</font>

314
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,135
<font color=#0080C0>Let's get your bags. Let's go.</font>

315
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,346
<font color=#0080C0>Leave the bags.
We've got a jeepney to catch.</font>

316
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,807

<font color=#0080C0>Let me tell you
how resourceful Filipinos are.</font>

320
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:32,027
<font color=#0080C0>A jeepney is exactly what it is. When
the Americans left, they left their jeeps.</font>

321
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,030
<font color=#0080C0>The Filipinos were like, <font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font>
"Let's turn this into some type</font>

00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,284
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Jo]</font> And that's why it's a jeepney.</font>

-Yeah, Dad was born here.</font>

328
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,963
<font color=#0080C0>He left when he was young,
when he was six.</font>

<font color=#0080C0>-Never, no.
-That's so crazy.</font>

at what age?</font>

335
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,439
<font color=#0080C0>My dad immigrated to Iowa
when he was sixth grade.</font>

They got married in the Philippines,</font>

338
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,071
<font color=#0080C0>and he brought my mom over
when she was 21.</font>

339
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,867
<font color=#0080C0>When I told my parents I was coming here,
they dropped me at the airport in Iowa,</font>

00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:24,598
<font color=#0080C0>This is amazing for me because I'm around
people that look exactly like me.</font>

362
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,602
<font color=#0080C0>That's amazing.
I don't think all Asians look the same,</font>

363
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,563
<font color=#0080C0>but right when I got to the Philippines,
right when I got off the airplane,</font>

364
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,317
<font color=#0080C0>everyone looked at me and was like,
"You look exactly like Coco Martin."</font>

365
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,402
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs and cheers]</font>

366
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,156
<font color=#0080C0>I was like, "Who the hell is Coco Martin?"</font>

367
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,493
<font color=#0080C0>If you don't know who Coco Martin is,
he's the Tom Cruise of the Philippines.</font>

368
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,954
<font color=#0080C0>I looked this guy up on my phone.
I look exactly like him,</font>

369
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:49,039
<font color=#0080C0>if Coco Martin was on drugs.</font>

370
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,499
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

371
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:54,044
<font color=#0080C0>But it's amazing being around people that
look like me. I never had that in my life.</font>

372
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,714
<font color=#0080C0>I grew up in a town of 10,000 white people
and then just me.</font>

373
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,425
<font color=#0080C0>I was one of one Asian guy in this town.</font>

374
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,637
<font color=#0080C0>If you wanted to go
to the Chinese restaurant where I grew up,</font>

375
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,055
<font color=#0080C0>you went to our house.</font>

376
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:10,269
<font color=#0080C0>That's how white this place is.
And my name is Andrew Lopez.</font>

377
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:14,815
<font color=#0080C0>Do you know how confusing that was
for all the white people?</font>

378
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,235
<font color=#0080C0>My entire life, I had to give
presentations on what an Asian was,</font>

379
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,945
<font color=#0080C0>because they had never seen one before.</font>

380
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,656
<font color=#0080C0>For my third-grade show and tell,
you know what I did?</font>

381
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,200
<font color=#0080C0>I brought my mom to school.</font>

382
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,244
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

383
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,080
<font color=#0080C0>I showed her off
and I told the kids I was Filipino,</font>

384
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,832
<font color=#0080C0>and that word blew their minds</font>

385
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,334
<font color=#0080C0>because they had never heard that word
their entire lives.</font>

386
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,587
<font color=#0080C0>They straight up thought it was a disease
I was talking about.</font>

387
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:42,634
<font color=#0080C0>Kids on the playground were like, "Yo,
bro, did you hear about the Mexican kid?</font>

388
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,388
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah. It turns out he has Filipino."</font>

389
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,808
<font color=#0080C0>But I got out of there.</font>

390
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,185
<font color=#0080C0>Now I'm seeing you guys,
and I'm taking in the culture,</font>

391
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,855
<font color=#0080C0>and I want to see the ladies,
and I want to connect with you,</font>

392
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,317
<font color=#0080C0>and that's why I turned my Tinder on
right when I got in this bitch.</font>

393
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,403
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah. It's on a 500 ft. radius, too,</font>

394
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,489
<font color=#0080C0>so all the thotties in here,
let's match up, let's link up.</font>

395
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,784
<font color=#0080C0>I have a passport.
I'll take you back to America. Let's go.</font>

396
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,664
<font color=#0080C0>I'll hold you, bathe you, marry you,
kiss your butt and your mouth tonight.</font>

397
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,916
<font color=#0080C0>Let's do it. I'm in. I love Tinder.</font>

398
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,960
<font color=#0080C0>And don't pretend
like you're not on Tinder.</font>

399
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,129
<font color=#0080C0>I watched the girls walk in, in here.</font>

400
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,591
<font color=#0080C0>The girls with the fake eyebrows,
you're the ones on Tinder. I know.</font>

401
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,552
<font color=#0080C0>And don't worry,
I swipe right on everyone by the way.</font>

402
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,973
<font color=#0080C0>So all you girls, let's go tonight.
I swipe right on every single picture.</font>

403
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,351
<font color=#0080C0>I never swipe left,
because all I'm looking for is love.</font>

404
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,187
<font color=#0080C0>I don't even look at the pictures.
I do it in my pocket like this.</font>

405
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,897
<font color=#0080C0>I walk around all day swiping right.</font>

406
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,067
<font color=#0080C0>I don't even know who's gonna be
in my hotel room tonight. Let's go.</font>

407
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,487
<font color=#0080C0>I love Tinder so much
that it changed everything about me.</font>

408
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,365
<font color=#0080C0>I wish I was gay,
so I could suck dick and get more matches.</font>

409
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,407
<font color=#0080C0>Do you understand?</font>

410
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:51,578
<font color=#0080C0>I love Tinder so much, man. Tinder
is the most positive thing in my life.</font>

411
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,914
<font color=#0080C0>I'm wearing a condom right now.</font>

412
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,916
<font color=#0080C0>It's a magnum, too.</font>

413
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,211
<font color=#0080C0>I don't fit, but it makes me feel black
and that's how I get more matches.</font>

414
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,925
<font color=#0080C0>That's some dumb smart shit I'm saying
by the way.</font>

415
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,219
<font color=#0080C0>I know a lot of dumb smart people.</font>

416
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,223
<font color=#0080C0>If you don't know what a dumb smart person
is, you've got to meet a smart racist.</font>

417
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,933
<font color=#0080C0>That's a dumb smart person.</font>

418
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,644
<font color=#0080C0>If you don't know what a smart racist is,
some examples.</font>

419
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,479
<font color=#0080C0>I met a guy
that was a smart racist person.</font>

420
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,689
<font color=#0080C0>He came up to me one time,
like, "Hey, bro.</font>

421
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,818
<font color=#0080C0>What's up with all these Asians
using chopsticks?"</font>

422
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,778
<font color=#0080C0>I was like,
"Do you have a problem with Asians?"</font>

423
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,239
<font color=#0080C0>He's like, "I just think
that forks and spoons are easier."</font>

424
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,198
<font color=#0080C0>And I was like...</font>

425
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,783
<font color=#0080C0>"You're right. I don't..."</font>

426
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,163
<font color=#0080C0>I have parents that are very genuine.
My parents are dope.</font>

427
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,499
<font color=#0080C0>I love them so much.
They cared about me my entire life.</font>

428
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,502
<font color=#0080C0>My dad was in the Air Force. He did
everything for me to have a better life.</font>

429
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,337
<font color=#0080C0>My dad is a competitive Filipino.</font>

430
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,840
<font color=#0080C0>And if you know a competitive Filipino,
they're crazy.</font>

431
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,427
<font color=#0080C0>Filipino dads, you know how competitive
they are by watching them sneeze.</font>

432
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,178
<font color=#0080C0>Filipino dads, they sneeze loud as shit</font>

433
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,722
<font color=#0080C0>and they try to sneeze louder
than the other dads. It's amazing.</font>

434
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,808
<font color=#0080C0>You know exactly who I'm talking about.</font>

435
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,519
<font color=#0080C0>You'll be at church, the entire church
will be completely quiet,</font>

436
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,479
<font color=#0080C0>but if your dad needs to sneeze,
he'll just...</font>

437
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:00,939
<font color=#808080>[sneezes forcefully]</font>

438
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,652
<font color=#0080C0>And bless himself, like, "Bless me."</font>

439
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,991
<font color=#0080C0>My mom was dope, too.
My mom gave me harsh love.</font>

440
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,326
<font color=#0080C0>I remember the first time
my mom caught me drinking.</font>

441
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,454
<font color=#0080C0>I was 16 years old,
I had a bottle of whiskey.</font>

442
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,289
<font color=#0080C0>I walked in the room,
my mom caught me,</font>

443
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,083
<font color=#0080C0>and she was like,
"What are you doing with that alcohol?</font>

444
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,170
<font color=#0080C0>Do you know what that does to people?"</font>

445
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,465
<font color=#0080C0>Do you remember when you got caught
smoking a cigarette as a kid,</font>

446
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,967
<font color=#0080C0>and your mom was like,
"What are you doing with that cigarette?</font>

447
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,760
<font color=#0080C0>Do you know what it does to people?"</font>

448
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,598
<font color=#0080C0>And, as a punishment, they made you smoke
the entire pack of cigarettes?</font>

449
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,726
<font color=#0080C0>My mom caught me
with that bottle of whiskey and was like,</font>

450
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,979
<font color=#0080C0>"What are you doing with that whiskey?
Do you know what this does to people?"</font>

451
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,023
<font color=#0080C0>And then she drank the whole thing.</font>

452
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,235
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you, guys. I'm Andrew Lopez.
I appreciate and love you guys.</font>

make some noise for Joey Guila!</font>

455

<font color=#0080C0>Oh, yeah! Philippines!</font>

456
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,293
<font color=#0080C0>Yes, come on! I feel it! Keep it going!</font>

458
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,175
<font color=#0080C0>Thank you so much.
That sounded like a fart.</font>

459
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:11,968
<font color=#808080>[makes fart sound]</font>

460
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,054
<font color=#0080C0>Make some noise if you believe in this.</font>

461
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,307
<font color=#0080C0>We need to see more Filipinos
on the big screen in Hollywood.</font>

462
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,935
<font color=#0080C0>Right?</font>

463
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,605
<font color=#0080C0>I want to see
the first Filipino cowboy movie.</font>

464
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,690
<font color=#0080C0>Can you imagine that?</font>

<font color=#808080>[makes clip-clop noises]</font>

<font color=#0080C0>Oy.</font>

469
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,916
<font color=#0080C0>I just went
to my 30th high school reunion.</font>

470
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,168
<font color=#0080C0>Yes. And I didn't even graduate.</font>

471
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,713
<font color=#0080C0>I just wanted to go to the party.</font>

472
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,424
<font color=#0080C0>Everyone was at that party though.</font>

473
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,303
<font color=#0080C0>When the DJ played the first song,
we were like, "Oh! That's my jam."</font>

474
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,806
<font color=#0080C0>Two songs later,
we're like, "Oh! That's my gout."</font>

<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

476
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,605
<font color=#0080C0>I love going to Filipino parties,
especially my own.</font>

00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,775
<font color=#0080C0>My auntie always greets me with an insult.</font>

479
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,363
<font color=#0080C0>Does it happen to you guys, too?
That one auntie. Right?</font>

480
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,364

"What happened to your face?"</font>

482
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,121
<font color=#0080C0>"What's wrong with it?"
<font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> "It's like that.</font>

483
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,873
<font color=#0080C0>What happened to your neck?"</font>

484
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,417
<font color=#0080C0>She has a flashlight.</font>

485
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,462
<font color=#0080C0>"What's wrong with my neck?"

489
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,643
<font color=#0080C0>What happened to the skinny one?"</font>

490
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,190
<font color=#0080C0>I say, "You're mean, Auntie."
<font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> "I'm not mean.</font>

492
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,155
<font color=#0080C0>She's religious when she gambles, too.</font>

493
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,825
<font color=#0080C0>You should see her
at the slot machines in Vegas.</font>

00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,994
<font color=#0080C0>She's got a long rosary.
She just puts it around there.</font>

499
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,838

00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:23,642
<font color=#0080C0>I was in the hospital.
I've been in remission from cancer.</font>

<font color=#0080C0>I'm like, "Nurse? Nurse, help."</font>

512
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,206
<font color=#0080C0>They didn't listen. They'd walk by.</font>

513
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,707
<font color=#0080C0>I'd go, "Nurse, wait. Wait.</font>

00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:55,924
<font color=#0080C0>I could give you something for free."</font>

<font color=#0080C0>Philippines! I'm Joey Guila.
Thank you guys so much.</font>

<font color=#0080C0>Andrew Lopez.</font>

522
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,820
<font color=#0080C0>A very confusing name for a Filipino.</font>

523
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,948
<font color=#0080C0>That's why we all have nicknames.
That's the truth.</font>

524
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,409
<font color=#0080C0>Like Jo Koy is not my real name.</font>

525
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,202
<font color=#0080C0>That's my nickname.</font>

526
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,080
<font color=#0080C0>See, you guys are in shock.
<font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> "What?</font>

527
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:29,499
<font color=#0080C0>He's an impostor?"</font>

528
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,088
<font color=#0080C0>That's my nickname. My aunt gave me that.</font>

529
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,174
<font color=#0080C0>My Auntie Evelyn gave me my name
"Jo Koy." That's not my real name.</font>

530
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,510
<font color=#0080C0>I started stand-up 30 years ago in 1989.</font>

531
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:44,681
<font color=#0080C0>I used to go up with my real name,
you guys. Joseph Glenn Herbert.</font>

532
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,349
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

533
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,643
<font color=#0080C0>Fuck you! That's why I changed my name!</font>

534
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,729
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs and cheers]</font>

535
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,689
<font color=#0080C0>Literally.</font>

536
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,275
<font color=#0080C0>When you first start stand-up,
you've got to do open mics,</font>

537
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,402
<font color=#0080C0>you've got to do bars,
you've got to do restaurants.</font>

538
00:28:57,485 --> 00:29:00,488
<font color=#0080C0>You only get three minutes,
and I would go up with my real name,</font>

539
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,656
<font color=#0080C0>and then people would laugh.</font>

540
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,701
<font color=#0080C0>"Joseph Glenn Herbert." Fucking people
would laugh. I'm like, "God damn it."</font>

541
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,328
<font color=#0080C0>All my sets were about my fucking name.</font>

542
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,498
<font color=#0080C0>Then I went to my aunt's house
after one of the shows.</font>

543
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,334
<font color=#0080C0>My cousin Mona lives there,
and I was talking to Mona.</font>

544
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,172
<font color=#0080C0>I was just like, "Mona, I've got to change
my name. Every time I go up on stage,</font>

545
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,549
<font color=#0080C0>they say my name, they laugh."</font>

546
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:23,261
<font color=#0080C0>And then my cousin was like,
"Yeah, 'cause your name sucks."</font>

547
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,596
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

548
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,267
<font color=#0080C0>I go, "Okay, I know that." She's like,
"We've got to change your name."</font>

549
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:33,354
<font color=#0080C0>She goes, "All right.
Why don't you drop your last name</font>

550
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,648
<font color=#0080C0>and just go with your middle name
as your last name?"</font>

551
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:36,858
<font color=#0080C0>I go, "Joseph Glenn?"</font>

552
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,944
<font color=#0080C0>She goes, "Yeah, that sucks, too. Listen."</font>

553
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,405
<font color=#0080C0>She goes, "Get rid of your middle name,</font>

554
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,408
<font color=#0080C0>and then take your last name,
and then move it to your first name."</font>

555
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,327
<font color=#0080C0>I go, "Bitch, that's still Herbert."</font>

556
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,995
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

557
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:52,582
<font color=#0080C0>And right when I said that,
my Auntie Evelyn was in the kitchen.</font>

558
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,334
<font color=#0080C0>She goes,
<font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> "Jo Koy, eat.</font>

559
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,504
<font color=#0080C0>Jo Koy, eat. Jo Koy, eat."</font>

560
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,047
<font color=#0080C0>I swear to God, I was like...</font>

561
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,049
<font color=#0080C0>"That's my name."</font>

562
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,511
<font color=#0080C0>She had been calling me that my whole
life, but it wasn't until that moment</font>

563
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,096
<font color=#0080C0>when I knew I had to change my name,
I was like, "That's my name.</font>

564
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:09,724
<font color=#0080C0>I'm going to go by Jo Koy."</font>

565
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,893
<font color=#0080C0>1989. That's when I was like,
"I'm gonna use Jo Koy."</font>

566
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,687
<font color=#0080C0>Since then, for 30 years,
I've been going up as Jo Koy.</font>

567
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,190
<font color=#0080C0>Then when this last special came out...</font>

568
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,610
<font color=#0080C0>I had to do press,
and they kept interviewing me.</font>

569
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,738
<font color=#0080C0>And every reporter
kept landing on the same question.</font>

570
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,323
<font color=#0080C0>"Why do you go by Jo Koy?"</font>

571
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,408
<font color=#0080C0>I was like, "I don't have an answer."</font>

572
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:28,993
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

573
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,747
<font color=#0080C0>I go, "That's just what Filipinos do.</font>

574
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,125
<font color=#0080C0>They name you one thing
and then fucking call you something else."</font>

575
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:42,298
<font color=#0080C0>And this is a very true story,
'cause I just found this out, you guys.</font>

576
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,217
<font color=#0080C0>This happened about four months ago.</font>

577
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,679
<font color=#0080C0>I went to Vegas
and I took my Auntie Evelyn out to eat.</font>

578
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,348
<font color=#0080C0>And I just looked at her and I go,
"Look, Auntie,</font>

579
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:54,269
<font color=#0080C0>a lot of reporters are asking me
where I got my nickname,</font>

580
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,772
<font color=#0080C0>and I don't have a story,
so can you just tell me a story,</font>

581
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,859
<font color=#0080C0>why you came up with the nickname Jo Koy?"</font>

582
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,819
<font color=#0080C0>She's really old.
You've got to understand.</font>

583
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,154
<font color=#0080C0>She looked at me and she went like this,
she goes...</font>

584
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,449
<font color=#0080C0><font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font>
"I don't call you Jo Koy."</font>

585
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,869
<font color=#808080>[crowd laughs]</font>

586
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,293
<font color=#0080C0>And then I was like,
"Oh my God, she's old.</font>

587
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,545
<font color=#0080C0>She's losing it.</font>

588
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:23,882
<font color=#0080C0>She's losing it."</font>

589
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,719
<font color=#0080C0>So I felt bad. I went like this.
I go, "Auntie, no, it's me.</font>

590
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,430
<font color=#0080C0>It's me. I'm Jo Koy.</font>

591
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,641
<font color=#0080C0>I'm Jo Koy.</font>

592
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:38,229
<font color=#0080C0>I'm Jo Koy, your favorite...
your favorite... nephew. I'm...</font>

593
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:40,356
<font color=#0080C0>I'm Jo Koy."</font>

594
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,235
<font color=#0080C0>And then she goes,
<font color=#808080>[Filipino accent]</font> "I know who you are.</font>

595
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,820
<font color=#0080C0>I'm not stupid.</font>

596
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:51,367
<font color=#0080C0>I'm just telling you
I don't call you Jo Koy."</font>

597
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,580
<font color=#0080C0>I go, "What are you talking about,
you don't call me Jo Koy? You were--</font>

598
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,790
<font color=#0080C0>Are you fucking with me right now? Like...</font>

599
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,084
<font color=#0080C0>Are you being serious?</font>

600
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,795
<font color=#0080C0>Thirty years, I've been going by Jo Koy.

-Right.</font>

723
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,306
<font color=#0080C0>And now we've got these three kids
that are inspired by that.</font>

724
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:33,227
<font color=#0080C0>We give our people the chance
to realize that it's possible.</font>

725
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:37,315
<font color=#0080C0>You can look like us
and be from where we're from--</font>

726
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,150
<font color=#0080C0>-Exactly.
-And actually do something.</font>

727
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,110
<font color=#0080C0>For a long time,
we didn't really have that--</font>

-That vision.</font>

729
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,865
<font color=#0080C0>Like, "Yo, I can get in the booth,
because !llmind did it."</font>

730
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,534
<font color=#0080C0>Or, "I can get on stage and tell jokes,
'cause Jo Koy did it."</font>

731
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,827
<font color=#0080C0>"I can do it."</font>

<font color=#0080C0>That's real. No, that's real.
That's real shit.</font>

734
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,209
<font color=#0080C0>Damn, you're the shit. Love you.</font>

<font color=#0080C0>I can't wait to see you walk out
with this shit, bro.</font>

736
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,799
<font color=#0080C0>-Right? It's gonna be so sick.

that's backwards for "idol."</font>

<font color=#0080C0>Well, brother, actually her name is Ludi.</font>

in that restaurant.</font>

787
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,830
<font color=#0080C0>and go, "Hey, can we use your kitchen?"
Like, "What?"</font>

788
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,458
<font color=#0080C0>-My favorite dish is chicken adobo.
-Yeah.</font>

789
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,919
<font color=#0080C0>Ever taste something
that takes you back to childhood?</font>

790
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,047
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah. My mom used to cook it
all the time when we were young.</font>

791
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,549
<font color=#0080C0>To this day, I still remember the pot
that it was cooked in.</font>

792
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:52,718
<font color=#0080C0>-Yes.
-I think my mom still has that pot.</font>

793
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,803
<font color=#0080C0>When you had friends come over
and try chicken adobo,</font>

794
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,180
<font color=#0080C0>did they not go, "What?"</font>

<font color=#0080C0>When you started doing stand-up,
did you think,</font>

<font color=#0080C0>-Never.
-Never, right?</font>

I'd be out here doing this.</font>

<font color=#0080C0>-Really? Yeah.

813
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,432
<font color=#0080C0>-Anybody?
-Just anybody in the Philippines.</font>

814
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,850
<font color=#0080C0>Just Filipinos in general.</font>

816
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,813
<font color=#0080C0>-Yeah.
-Funny is funny.</font>

817
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:49,108
<font color=#0080C0>The only time they're not gonna laugh
is if you're not funny.</font>

<font color=#0080C0>-Right?
-It's true.</font>

819

and I'm excited to be performing.</font>

842
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:12,232
<font color=#0080C0>If you don't know, those are the glasses
where the lenses will actually change</font>

843
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:15,069
<font color=#0080C0>so people don't have sex with you and...</font>

844
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,072
<font color=#0080C0>And those glasses are ridiculous to me.</font>

845
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,658
<font color=#0080C0>I don't know if anybody in this room
has them.</font>

846
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,326
<font color=#0080C0>If you do, don't tell me.</font>

847
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,787
<font color=#0080C0>I don't respect you.
You know what I'm saying?</font>

848
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:28,165
<font color=#0080C0>Are those them, my man? Are those them?</font>

849
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,709
<font color=#0080C0>Look into this light right now. Look--
No, I'm just kidding.</font>

850
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:34,046
<font color=#0080C0>I take that back.
If you do have those glasses,</font>

851
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,840
<font color=#0080C0>I actually would like you to let me know
that you're wearing them</font>

852
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,258
<font color=#0080C0>before you start talking to me.</font>

853
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,469
<font color=#0080C0>That's only because,
when I was talking to my dad,</font>

854
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:43,138
<font color=#0080C0>they changed mid-conversation.</font>

855
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,850
<font color=#0080C0>And I had never felt so disrespected
in my life, you know?</font>

856
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:50,771
<font color=#0080C0>And that's because when we were talking,
we were going from inside to outside</font>

857
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,106
<font color=#0080C0>and then they start to get dark.</font>

858
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,609
<font color=#0080C0>So I sped up my sentence, 'cause I felt
like I was running out of time.</font>

859
00:44:56,694 --> 00:45:00,406
<font color=#0080C0>But that's my dad.
He's just like a real goofy-ass dad.</font>

860
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,907
<font color=#0080C0>You know, like he's so goofy</font>

861
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,327
<font color=#0080C0>that he voted for Trump. That's who he is.</font>

862
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:11,709
<font color=#0080C0>And it was so crazy to me, you know,
only because I had no idea</font>

863
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,545
<font color=#0080C0>that he was even a citizen
of the country, so...</font>

864
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,299
<font color=#0080C0>I've been hanging out with my dad a lot</font>

865
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,303
<font color=#0080C0>and I think it's 'cause we're trying
to make up for lost time or whatever.</font>

866
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,680
<font color=#0080C0>My parents aren't together.</font>

867
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:26,849
<font color=#0080C0>Anybody else grow up
in a single-parent household?</font>

868
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,560
<font color=#0080C0>It was your fault. And...</font>

869
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:32,688
<font color=#0080C0>Just kidding.</font>

870
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,693
<font color=#0080C0>My parents aren't together.
My parents split up when I was, like, 12.</font>

871
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:42,030
<font color=#0080C0>And then, when I was 15,
I found out. Yeah.</font>

872
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,366
<font color=#0080C0>For a good while, I had no idea. Just...</font>

873
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,078
<font color=#0080C0>Just one day I went up to my mom,
like, "Where's Dad been at?"</font>

874
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,457
<font color=#0080C0>She looked at me like,
"I knew I forgot something. Oh, man."</font>

875
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,126
<font color=#0080C0>Growing up--</font>

876
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:56,378
<font color=#0080C0>I have a sister,
and neither of us knew he was gone.</font>

877
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,548
<font color=#0080C0>That's because, when he lived with us,
he didn't hang out with us at all.</font>

878
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,216
<font color=#0080C0>He was gone all the time already.</font>

879
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,344
<font color=#0080C0>So there was no real, like,
emotional attachment to him.</font>

880
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,554
<font color=#0080C0>It was kind of like this.</font>

881
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:09,183
<font color=#0080C0>You know when you're at a party and you're
in a conversation with two other people,</font>

882
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,852
<font color=#0080C0>and those two people
are really engaged in the conversation,</font>

883
00:46:11,935 --> 00:46:13,395
<font color=#0080C0>and you're not really contributing,</font>

884
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,648
<font color=#0080C0>so you kind of just slowly
just walk out of the conversation?</font>

885
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,861
<font color=#0080C0>And then start a new family.
You ever do that? That's wild.</font>

886
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:23,906
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah.</font>

887
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:28,285
<font color=#0080C0>We still talk all the time.</font>

888
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:32,998
<font color=#0080C0>He just got a new job.
He's currently a grade-school bus driver,</font>

889
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,417
<font color=#0080C0>which is so silly to me, you know.</font>

890
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,337
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause it's like, "Okay,
you wouldn't drive this kid to school,</font>

891
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,839
<font color=#0080C0>but now you want to drive
everybody's kids to school. Right?</font>

892
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:42,800
<font color=#0080C0>Fine. Fine."</font>

893
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,764
<font color=#0080C0>I live in California, uh...</font>

894
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,891
<font color=#0080C0>And we get a lot of earthquakes.</font>

895
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:54,728
<font color=#0080C0>Before I do this,
do we all know what the Richter scale is?</font>

896
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,147
<font color=#0080C0>Okay, good,
'cause I've been thinking about it</font>

897
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:01,276
<font color=#0080C0>and I think it's crazy that the way
we measure earthquake magnitude</font>

898
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,946
<font color=#0080C0>can also be applied to dick size.</font>

899
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,072
<font color=#0080C0>Uh...</font>

900
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:08,075
<font color=#0080C0>Yeah, some of you get it already.
Really think about it.</font>

901
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,618
<font color=#0080C0>Say you're working with, like, a 3.5,</font>

902
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:12,496
<font color=#0080C0>you're like, "Did you feel that shit?"
No, nobody did. Nobody felt that.</font>

903
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,081
<font color=#0080C0>What? Wild.</font>

904
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:21,088
<font color=#0080C0>5.5 to 6, you can handle that, you know.</font>

905
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,465
<font color=#0080C0>That comes around the most often</font>

906
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,426
<font color=#0080C0>and, to be honest, might be the best one.
Shut up.</font>

907
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,850
<font color=#0080C0>6.5 to, like, 7, now you're like,
"Whoa, that was wild.</font>

908
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,394
<font color=#0080C0>We could probably go through that again,</font>

909
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:38,438
<font color=#0080C0>but maybe we should be more prepared
next time." You hear what I'm saying?</font>

910
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:42,776
<font color=#0080C0>And then anything above an eight,
you're like,</font>

911
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,697
<font color=#0080C0>"Oh, my God. Everything is ruined.
Everything is ruined.</font>

912
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,702
<font color=#0080C0>And my dog's dead." What? Why?</font>

913
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,248
<font color=#0080C0>That's been my favorite joke to tell</font>

914
00:47:56,331 --> 00:48:00,586
<font color=#0080C0>as of late, only because I can see
where the dudes are at in the joke</font>

915
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,796
<font color=#0080C0>when I look at you and tell it.</font>

916
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:08,010
<font color=#0080C0>'Cause a lot of you
look real sad at three, but...</font>

917
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,598
<font color=#0080C0>But at eight, this dude elbowed his girl
like, "That's me, baby. That's me."</font>

918
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,475
<font color=#0080C0>She's not disagreeing. All right.</font>

919
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,354
<font color=#0080C0>All right, that's my time.
Thank you so much. Bye.</font>
