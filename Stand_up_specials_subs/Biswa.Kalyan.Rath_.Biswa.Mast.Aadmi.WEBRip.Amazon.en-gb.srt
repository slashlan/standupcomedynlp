1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Hi!

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,800
This is Biswa.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,040
The cool dude, Biswa.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,480
People would often ask him...

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,880
How much wood would a wood chuck
chuck a wood chuck could chuck wood?

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,320
The answer is...

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,040
All of it.

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,240
Help? Who needs help?

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,160
People who need help
are nothing but losers.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,000
You need only yourself
to organise your show!

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,200
Because he is...

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,080
Light guy,

13
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,880
sound guy,

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,200
sex guy,

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:28,800
press guy,

16
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,520
DJ guy,

17
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,080
spot guy,

18
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,720
mosquito guy,

19
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,480
producer guy,

20
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,080
boom guy,

21
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,920
this boom guy,

22
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:33,480
walky guy,

23
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,200
fan guy,

24
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:34,680
fire guy,

25
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,640
fire extinguisher guy,

26
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,320
make-up guy,

27
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:36,920
watchman guy,

28
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,600
cameraman guy,

29
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,520
Shaktiman guy.

30
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,840
Ladies, gentlemen...

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,080
a huge round of applause

32
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,120
for Biswa Kalyan Rath.

33
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,680
*audience cheering*

34
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,320
Hello! Hi!

35
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,600
*audience cheering*

36
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,200
I know, I know, it sounds like...

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,560
It looks like it's a big deal.

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,240
It’s fucking not...

39
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,040
It’s not a big deal.
When I upload the video,

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,520
first comment, “Good video,
but when is the next one coming?”

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,360
The future of this nation is bleak.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,240
At a wedding,
“Nice husband but when is the baby due?”

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,600
This exercise is pointless.

44
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,720
I know they made an announcement.
They said,

45
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,400
“Don’t go to the toilet,
even if you have to shit."

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,920
I agree, just shit right here.

47
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,480
On the chair.

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,680
Unzip your pants and
go in the open.

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,480
No tension.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,920
It will look awesome.

51
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,000
Biswa cracks a joke,
cut to audience.

52
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,680
People are laughing except
two people are shitting.

53
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,080
Laughing and shitting at the same time.

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,920
One male, one female. Feminist.

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,520
It’s that kind of a show.

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
Let's start the show.

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,720
Let's start the show.

58
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,840
I went into to a shop and asked,
“Bro, do you have Tic Tac?”

59
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,000
He said, "I have no Tic Tac,
but do you want a Kit Kat?”

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,720
I said, “Don’t try this tactic.”

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,640
He said, “Why are you getting angry?
Is everything alright at home?”

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,000
The end.

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,840
That’s a great story.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,240
A beginning, middle, end.

65
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Some stories don’t have endings.

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,560
In old stories they would
do weird things to end a story.

67
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,160
Have you heard the old stories?

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
In old, mythological stories,

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
a character would transform
into a different character.

70
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,240
A frog will explode into a prince.

71
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,440
I haven't seen it,
but maybe it happens!

72
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,800
Let‘s believe it.

73
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,080
Anything... Brahmin transforms into God.

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,480
Someone will explode and
turn into a demon or a sage.

75
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,080
In Mahabharata or Ramayana
if I see a bird, I don’t trust it.

76
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,120
If a bird enters the scene,
I am certain it will explode.

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Bird tries to act convincingly.

78
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,160
"Wow! What a bird! Look at my wings.

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,600
Cukoocukoo!"

80
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,560
"Here‘s my front profile,
my side profile, my side profile."

81
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,000
I am like this is not a bird.

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Damn, where were you
till the seventeenth chapter?

83
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,080
But the characters in
the story are blind to this.

84
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,760
Whenever they see a bird,

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,320
“Oh! A fat bird.
Let's kill it and make a biryani.”

86
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,600
The moment they shoot the bird,
God erupts and says,

87
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,920
“Surprise test! You have failed.”

88
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,360
Many characters pop up.

89
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,520
Soldier explodes into God.

90
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,080
Somebody explodes into a demon...

91
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,200
But I will tell you
real stories from my life.

92
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,000
Not mythology or old ones...

93
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,120
Because I am new.

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Didn’t see that mother
fucking punch line coming?

95
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,160
“I thought it was a sentence,
but a punchline!”

96
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,680
The first story. Is about me
trying to be cool in sixth standard.

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,560
Everything was fine at
school till in sixth standard

98
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
somebody figured out that
we can create our own signatures.

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,400
Now in general signature
is a unique identifier.

100
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
In my school, signature
was a status symbol.

101
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,280
Cooler the signature, cooler you are.

102
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,600
Manoj’s signature was
the same forward and backward.

103
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,160
He was super cool.

104
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,400
He used to eat other’s
tiffin during recess.

105
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Students would ask,
“Why are you eating from our tiffin?”

106
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760
“Did you see my signature?”
- “Wow! Eat. Eat everything.”

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,240
Krishna changed the dot above ‘I’
into a heart and a star in his signature...

108
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,560
The next you know he has a girlfriend.

109
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,920
“Wow! Krishna so sensitive.”

110
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,840
I decided even I need to be cool.

111
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
I made a signature. My name
is Biswa Kalyan Rath. I signed as BKR.

112
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,440
Two guys came running and
changed it into &lt;i&gt;Bekkar Bakar Bhikari&lt;/i&gt;.

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,720
Within two minutes
and then they danced.

114
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,680
“&lt;i&gt;Bekkar Bakar Bhikari
Bekkar Bakar Bhikari&lt;/i&gt;.”

115
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,600
I realised this signature won’t work.

116
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,960
I need a cool signature.
I was looking for an inspiration.

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,760
One day I saw my papa’s signature.

118
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,520
Papa signed and got money.

119
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
I wanted his signature.

120
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,640
So I forged my dad’s signature.

121
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,560
Dot to dot.

122
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,360
My name is Biswa Kalyan Rath,
my signature was Jagan Mohan Rath.

123
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,400
I showed it to my
friends in the classroom.

124
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,200
Everyone liked it.

125
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,840
So they started practicing
my dad’s signature in their notebooks.

126
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,160
Everyone’s signature was Jagan Mohan Rath.

127
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,400
Everyone were practicing
Jagan Mohan Rath in their books.

128
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,400
Madam wrote a note,
"Your child is not doing his homework."

129
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
Its okay, Jagan Mohan Rath.

130
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,480
Madam asked,
“Who is this Jagan Mohan Rath?

131
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,680
How come everyone has the same father?"

132
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,160
Madam called my Papa.
“Hello!”

133
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
[Papa] “Yes. Jagan Mohan Rath.”

134
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,520
[Madam] “Your son is up to something.”

135
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,600
[Papa] “I will look into it.”

136
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,280
That day when I came home.
Papa was waiting at the door,

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,920
in position.

138
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,000
I thought, 'Oh bad news!'

139
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,800
I tried to escape him.
But he caught me by my hair.

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,080
He said, “Show me your rough notebook.”

141
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,000
I gave him my notebook.

142
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
He scanned the first few
pages but couldn’t find anything.

143
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,560
I said, 'Oh!

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
The deception has worked.'

145
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,120
Then he scanned the last pages.
I was caught red handed.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,440
CIA has hacked my computer.

147
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,880
I had scribbled my heart out there.

148
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,520
No one had ever given me a personal diary.

149
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,520
So I used to write
everything in that notebook.

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,920
It was filled with my father’s signature
Jagan Mohan Rath, Jagan Mohan Rath...

151
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,080
I love Snigdha.

152
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,720
Jagan Mohan Rath, Jagan Mohan Rath...

153
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,280
Penis. Jagan Mohan Rath, Jagan Mohan Rath...

154
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,360
Vagina. Jagan Mohan Rath...

155
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
I also made an illustration
of a penis and vagina.

156
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,240
I made a small stick figure
with a small line depicting a penis.

157
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,880
And a stick figure with boobs for vagina.

158
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,440
Because I couldn’t figure out
how to draw a stick figure of vagina.

159
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,320
Kid is horny with hormones
but has no artistic integrity.

160
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,440
Yeah...

161
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,480
These great artworks were signed by
the artist, Jagan Mohan Rath.

162
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,960
My father saw it and gave me
the thrashing of my life.

163
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,040
WWE is nothing compared to the
thrashing a middle class father can give.

164
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,280
John Cena says, “You can’t see me.”

165
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,600
My father, “I can see you.
You will go flying with one slap...”

166
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,000
John Cena will run away.

167
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,360
My father was Sivamani
and I his drums.

168
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,680
He bashed me up real good.

169
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,200
Slapped me from every possible angle.

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,880
My father has two hands...

171
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,120
But I could feel the bashing of three.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
That’s how quantum my father is.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,280
I was being whacked...

174
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,520
He has caught me,
and pinned me to the floor,

175
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,560
giving me the bashing of my life.

176
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,360
I asked him, “Where do you think I’ll run off
in your one BHK apartment?

177
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Have got me pinned me here!?"

178
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,360
My innocent brother who is four,
was passing by singing.

179
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
&lt;i&gt;"Captain Planet! He is the hero.
Extinguisher of pollution...&lt;/i&gt;"

180
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,240
Slap.

181
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,240
Captain Jagan Mohan in the house.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,320
Both of us got thrashed
and were lying on the floor.

183
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,800
Papa said, “Don’t forge my signature.”

184
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,960
I asked why?

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,040
He said, “It’s a federal offence.

186
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,920
I told him I don’t understand.
Send me to an English medium school.

187
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,600
So he translated it for me.

188
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,640
“God is watching everything.”

189
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,200
Now this was a very
low budget translation.

190
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,960
This is Google translator in 1995.

191
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,000
Papa said, “God is watching everything.”

192
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,040
I thought, ‘Oh God!

193
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,280
If papa is right.

194
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,960
If God is really watching everything...

195
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Then I'm in serious trouble.

196
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,360
Forging signatures is only
one of the crimes that the child commits.

197
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,080
This kid has a dark side...

198
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,720
God must be having a tough time.'

199
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,080
So I thought let me ask papa,
if God is watching everything or not?

200
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,400
From where is God watching?

201
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,200
As soon as papa gauged
the logic in my eyes,

202
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,800
he quickly applied his and said,

203
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,040
“I am getting late for work.
I am going.”

204
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,960
Papa went. I was lying on the floor.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,960
My curiosity was left unanswered
and then the tables turned.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,120
We were out of gas at home.

207
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,880
Ma had called for the gas cylinder.

208
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,040
The delivery guy arrived.

209
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,960
He said, “Madam please
sign and take the delivery.”

210
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,360
Ma signed, but he said,
“No no, Jagan Mohan Rath.”

211
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,120
I smiled.

212
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,400
The valuation of my
start up just increased.

213
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,960
Jagan Mohan Rath’s demand
has increased in the market.

214
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,080
Let me sell it right away for $3 million.

215
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,640
I stood up and walked around.

216
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,200
Ma asked me to sign.
I said, ‘No ma.’

217
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,720
Must act pricy.

218
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,880
God is watching everything.

219
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,000
So ma did what every mother does.
She called my father.

220
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,120
She said, “Hello! Talk to your son.

221
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,280
Talk to your father.”

222
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
I said, 'Thanks for the introduction, ma.'

223
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,280
‘Hello papa, looks like you
need a real man to solve your problem.’

224
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
Papa said, “Sign it.”

225
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,560
I said, ‘Papa,
God is watching everything.’

226
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,600
Papa said, “There is no God.
It was just a statement.”

227
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,960
Just a statement?

228
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,680
You gave me the thrashing of my life

229
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,320
and now you’re saying,
it’s just a statement?

230
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,000
Say sorry.

231
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,520
Papa said, “I will not apologise.”

232
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,240
I said, ‘Ma, talk to your husband.

233
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,640
Papa, talk to your wife.’
Thanks for the introduction.

234
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,040
Ma said, “Just tell him you are sorry.”

235
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,040
Papa wouldn’t listen.

236
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,720
Ma then dropped the nuclear bomb,

237
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,400
“I have spoilt my whole
life by marrying you.

238
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,120
I am not your maid.

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,320
Everyone is a gambling
addict in your family.”

240
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,280
Papa, “Sorry.”

241
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,240
The tyranny of the father
has ended and the son’s begun.

242
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
Since then he has never
looked me in the eye.

243
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,520
Now the son is an alpha
and the father is a toddler.

244
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,480
Full on.

245
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,280
Then I forged dad’s signature
on all his property papers and robbed him.

246
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,560
Today I have a house,
a car, a bungalow and ma too.

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,760
All Papa is left with is regrets.

248
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,480
That’s the Bollywood ending of that story.

249
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,800
Where in the end everything gets alright.

250
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,680
The actual ending is...

251
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,760
I said, “Hello Papa.”

252
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Papa said, "Sign it."

253
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,640
I said, “God is...”

254
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,920
Papa said, “I will slap you.”

255
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
A ten year old boy had
to choose between a slap and God.

256
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,960
Tough choice. I did a risk analysis.

257
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,240
A slap hurts, I know this.
But God I don’t know.

258
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,160
The possibility of getting
slapped was two hundred percent.

259
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,920
I know this.

260
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,240
God, fifty-fifty.

261
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,080
And overall I can prove
that a slap exists.

262
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,320
So I went and signed, Jagan Mohan Rath.

263
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,240
As soon as I signed the paper,
the delivery guy exploded
and God appeared.

264
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,080
He said, “Surprise test. You failed.”

265
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,960
Obviously that’s also not the real ending.

266
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,240
The real ending is, one day
the delivery guy came and said,

267
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,160
“Madam please sign here.”

268
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,320
Ma signed and he said, "Okay."
And he left.

269
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,640
That’s the fucking ending.

270
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
Nothing happened.
I was just daydreaming.

271
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,840
“Oh! Had this really happened,
I would’ve robbed all of dad’s property.”

272
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,360
But I lied and made this story up.

273
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,600
In half of the cities I haven’t
narrated the last ending.

274
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,120
The audience still thinks I am cool.

275
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,000
They think I actually robbed
my father’s property.

276
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,560
They’ll know when they watch
Amazon Prime Video, “Oh! He fooled us.”

277
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,080
But the quest of being cool never ends.

278
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,200
So I went to college.

279
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,480
What do we do in college?

280
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,520
Papa provided us with food and home.

281
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
We just have to become cool.

282
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,680
That is what I want to do in life.

283
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,680
The second story is about college.

284
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,880
'Rock band' is when four good musicians
come together to make great music.

285
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,480
The opposite of that is college rock band.

286
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,080
When four horrible musicians come
together to create embarrassing memories.

287
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,200
I am telling you this because
I was obviously part of a rock band.

288
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
I’ll introduce you to the members.

289
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,680
First member, his name was Joseph.

290
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,000
He wanted four things in life,

291
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,640
weed, guitar, himself and
him playing guitar on weed.

292
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,160
That's all he likes.

293
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
You say hi, he'll respond with
six hours of non-stop guitar.

294
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,000
He’s going crazy strumming.

295
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
The second member, his name was Kamlesh.

296
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Kamlesh was a little sad in life.

297
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
Because he had a break up,

298
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,800
eight years ago!

299
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,480
He kept on attempting suicide.

300
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,440
Every week he used to drink Dettol
and attempt suicide.

301
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,040
He wouldn’t die but sing really well
once he got up.

302
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,000
Because ninety nine percent of the germs
in his throat had died.

303
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,760
I know nobody has tried this.

304
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,400
People drink honey and germs thrive.

305
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,760
Kamlesh drinks Dettol and germs die.

306
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,440
The entire lineage of germs is wiped out.

307
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,880
Udit Narayan sings &lt;i&gt;Sa&lt;/i&gt;,

308
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
germs sing &lt;i&gt;Re Ga Re Ga&lt;/i&gt;.

309
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,840
Kamlesh has killed all the germs.

310
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,880
When he sings, no germs interfere.

311
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,760
He was odd,

312
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,480
he believed that if one includes
&lt;i&gt;Sa Re Ga Pa&lt;/i&gt; in a song,

313
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,560
it becomes classical music.

314
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,880
&lt;i&gt;“Ab toh aadat Sa Sa.”&lt;/i&gt;

315
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,160
He thought he was Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.

316
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,800
Third character, his name is Ghosh.

317
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,400
Ghosh was our drummer,
but actually he was a tabla player.

318
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,160
Because let’s face it,
India is a developing country.

319
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,440
No father is that cool
to buy a drum kit for his kid.

320
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,240
If you go to a country, somebody’s playing drums
and he is a teenager...

321
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,200
It’s a developed country.

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,520
Here there are no drum kits at home.

323
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,200
It’s only on TV that you see
a child playing drums.

324
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,680
Papa, I also want...
SLAP.

325
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,360
I am Sivamani. You’re a kid.

326
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,960
This is what happens.

327
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,040
And the final character is me.
I used to play bass.

328
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,440
Bass if you don’t know, good.

329
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,560
Bass is the intern of the band.

330
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,200
If a guitarist had three hands
then there was no need for a bassist.

331
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,160
Bass is a very lonely instrument.

332
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,920
I have five fingers but
bass has only four strings.

333
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Please do not use full potential.

334
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,000
Do not respect me.

335
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
I don’t know. I don’t blame you
if you don’t know what bass is.

336
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,120
Because when I was young,
I didn’t know what a guitar was

337
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,120
until I saw Salman Khan
play guitar to &lt;i&gt;‘O O Jaane Jaana’.&lt;/i&gt;

338
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,600
Then I knew. Because Salman
Khan brought a bike on stage.

339
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,240
Stage was on a beach.

340
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,920
I have seen a lot of beaches.

341
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,960
But I never saw
a stage on a beach.

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
I have seen a lot of stages.

343
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,800
But I never saw a bike on them.

344
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:56,720
Salman Khan was playing an
acoustic tune on an electric guitar.

345
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,080
Then he threw that guitar.

346
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,280
And it was still playing.

347
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,480
Ting ting... Threw it.

348
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Ting ting...

349
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,680
At no point in the performance
is the guitar connected to anything.

350
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,000
In 1996, he had a Bluetooth guitar.

351
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,680
Everyone’s happy.

352
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,440
Everyone’s dancing.

353
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,360
Ting ting...

354
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
I went crazy after seeing it.

355
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,920
I went running to my
papa and said, ‘Papa.’

356
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,840
He said, “Yes.”

357
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,960
I said, 'I am a creative man,
I want to be a guitarist.'

358
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,520
And my dad told me what
his dad told him and I quote.

359
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,400
My dad said, “NO!”

360
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,640
Because that’s what most of parenting is.

361
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,640
You just have to keep saying no.

362
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,600
Your kids will never ask
questions whose answer is yes.

363
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,120
He’ll not ask, “Papa, can I die
in the freedom struggle?”

364
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:51,960
Never.

365
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,600
Every time.

366
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,920
“Papa I ate cow dung for two hours
can I eat shit too?”

367
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,520
No.

368
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,240
But papa this is my dream.

369
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,640
“Yes but you are a creative man. Right?”

370
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
Yes.

371
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,080
“Then dream of something else.”

372
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,520
This Jagan Mohan is smart.

373
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,200
But which dream can make me cool, papa?
Tell me please.

374
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,640
Papa said, “Do one thing,
become an IITian.”

375
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,000
I asked, ‘IITian? Is it cool?’

376
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,120
Papa said, “Yes”

377
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,440
I said, ‘Well I don’t
know any other adults.

378
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,280
So I will go with your word.’

379
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,800
For ten years I slogged and finally
got admission in IIT Kharagpur.

380
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,920
On the first day I declared
to everyone at IIT Kharagpur,

381
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
‘Excuse me!
I am cool because I am IITian.’

382
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,160
They said, “Fucking idiot!

383
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,520
Everyone here is an IITian.”

384
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,440
I was like, ‘Oh fuck!’

385
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,080
I always knew there was a loophole
in Jagan Mohan’s logic.

386
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
Couldn’t catch it in time.

387
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,360
So how can one be cool in IIT?

388
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,960
A friend said, “Can you see those four guys
in black t-shirts and long hair?”

389
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
I said yes, I can see the four guys
in black t-shirts and long hair.

390
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,640
He said, “They are cool.”

391
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,640
I asked, why?

392
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,200
“Because they play guitar.”

393
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,800
I knew it since my childhood.

394
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,320
Should not have trusted that Jagan Mohan.

395
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I said even I want to be a black t-shirt,
long-haired guitarist.

396
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,240
I called my father

397
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
and said, ‘Hello papa!’

398
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,720
Papa said, “Hello, hello!”

399
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,120
‘I need nine thousand
five hundred and two rupees.’

400
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,320
Papa asked, “Why do you need nine
thousand five hundred and two rupees?”

401
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
‘Nine thousand for the guitar,

402
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,320
five hundred for the black t-shirt

403
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,000
and two rupees for the shampoo.

404
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,680
Papa said, “No.”

405
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,760
So I forged his signature
and took the money.

406
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Ten thousand five hundred and two rupees,

407
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,360
service tax included.

408
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,200
Not good service.

409
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,760
I still took the money.

410
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,080
Then I hired a guitar teacher,

411
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,560
‘Sir, make me a rock star.’

412
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,800
He said, “First we will study theory.”

413
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
I was like, ‘You are fired.’

414
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,800
I called another guitar teacher.

415
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,200
“Please make me a rock star.”

416
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,400
He said, “I will make you a rock star.”

417
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,520
“Please make me a rock star.”

418
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,640
He said, “I will make you a rock star.”

419
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,360
For the next three months
he taught me two songs,

420
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,280
very complex songs,
you might have not heard of them.

421
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,960
‘Twinkle twinkle little star’
and ‘Happy birthday to you’.

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I learnt these songs
and approached the band.

423
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,840
I was like, ‘Folks, can I join your band?

424
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,640
I am a guitarist.

425
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,920
I also wear black t-shirt
and have long hair.’

426
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
They asked, “What can you play?”

427
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,360
I said, ‘Twinkle twinkle little star.’

428
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,840
They said, “Fucking idiot.

429
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,000
Please get the fuck out of here."

430
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,920
I asked, ‘Why? My notes are perfect.’

431
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,240
They said, “This is a rock band.
We play rock music.”

432
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,280
I was like what is rock music?

433
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,280
Because I grew up in a small town.

434
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,120
I did not know rock was music.

435
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,200
I always thought
rocking was an adjective.

436
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,640
That you use when you
run out of adjectives.

437
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,880
You’re like good, better, best,
rocking bro, rocking!

438
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,840
In a Roadies audition if you say,
“&lt;i&gt;Jay Mata di&lt;/i&gt;! Let’s rock it.”

439
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,080
You will get selected.

440
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,040
That’s all I know about rock.

441
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,080
They said, “No. Rock is a form of music.”

442
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,720
I was like,‘Please make me listen
to some songs.’

443
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,440
So they made me listen to,
‘Hotel California’.

444
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,840
I thought it was a lousy song.

445
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,600
The song began like this,
“Welcome to the Hotel California...”

446
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,920
Asshole, if you are a receptionist
why did you write a song?

447
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,480
You should know your limits.

448
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,680
Either follow your dreams or do your job.

449
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,280
Don’t mix both.

450
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,720
And who names a song, Hotel California?

451
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
At least they should’ve used
some creativity in naming it.

452
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,400
If they open a hotel in Bhopal,
and name it Hotel Madhya Pradesh,

453
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,200
I am not going there.

454
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,920
At least you should name it
Madhya Pradesh Grand.

455
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,560
Okay. Now, maybe I can think of visiting it.

456
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,880
They keep on singing,
"You can check out any time you like.

457
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,200
But you can never leave.”

458
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,960
I said, ‘Please, don’t be so arrogant
I am not checking in also.

459
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,120
Give me back my ID proof. Please.’

460
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,520
What a rubbish song!

461
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,160
And the guitarist keep on playing.

462
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,520
*guitar noise*

463
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,120
Shut up!

464
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,840
What is it? Are you sad or happy?

465
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,200
There are only two emotions.
What is this abstract nonsense?

466
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,520
*guitar noise*
Shut up!

467
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,000
Did you have a break up?
*guitar noise*

468
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,200
Shut up!

469
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,360
I said, ‘I will make my own band.’

470
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,800
I don’t want to make lousy music like
this ‘Hotel California’.

471
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,160
I got out from there.

472
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,000
There were three people
already waiting for me.

473
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,720
I said, ‘Joseph.’

474
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,520
*guitar noises*

475
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,520
I said cool. Nice.

476
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,640
I said Kamlesh.

477
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
He said, &lt;i&gt;“Sa Sa Re Ga.&lt;/i&gt;

478
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,520
Will you drink Dettol?”

479
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,680
What?

480
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,680
&lt;i&gt;“Ma Ma Re Ga Sa.&lt;/i&gt;

481
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,680
Will you drink Savlon?”

482
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,520
Hey!

483
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,840
Not interested in
the general idea of pesticides.

484
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,720
Okay cool.

485
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,160
Then there was Ghosh.

486
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,080
I said, ‘Hello Ghosh.’

487
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,920
He said, &lt;i&gt;“Ta dhin dhin.”&lt;/i&gt;

488
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,040
I said, ‘No, you have been upgraded.’

489
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,000
He said, &lt;i&gt;“Dhum chick dish.”&lt;/i&gt;

490
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,320
I said, 'Yeah, Yeah! The band is ready.'

491
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,240
They asked, "What can you play?”

492
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,240
I said, ‘Happy birthday to you?’

493
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,720
They said, “You are bassist.”

494
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,880
I said, 'Alright then. Let’s rehearse.'

495
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,480
Joseph said, “After we smoke a joint.”

496
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,960
I said, ‘What’s a joint?’

497
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,520
In the next six months...

498
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I understood what Hotel California is.

499
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,400
Because I could see Hotel California.

500
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,200
I was in the hotel. Wow! What a corridor.

501
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,040
What chandelier!
Wow, beautiful!

502
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,720
I was drinking the hotel water.
Oh! The hotel water is good.

503
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,680
I went to the watchman and asked,
‘Can I checkout? Can I leave?’

504
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,640
He said, “Get out of here,
you stoned ass weirdo.”

505
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,360
There were only six days left
for the college fest to begin.

506
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,720
We were going to do a rock performance
against four guys, black t-shirts, long hair.

507
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,880
We rehearsed.

508
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,040
We agreed that we would
play Hotel California.

509
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,960
For six long days and nights,

510
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
we practiced continuously
without sleeping,

511
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,320
and brought it to a point
where it was bad.

512
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,480
But bad in the sense, that people
would say it’s terrible and walk away.

513
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,760
It was not so bad that they would say,

514
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,400
"Lets order tea and
witness this disaster unfold."

515
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,840
But on the last day we watched an
Iron Maiden performance video.

516
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,000
Things were happening in that.

517
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,480
The drummer spinning his sticks.

518
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Ghosh went crazy.

519
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,280
Oh! We can spin the sticks?

520
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,080
New possibilities have opened up.

521
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,800
The Iron Maiden guitarist was
running on the stage, playing the guitar.

522
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,880
Joseph said, “Wow! Never used my legs.

523
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,360
Must do something with legs.”

524
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,320
Kamlesh said, “I don’t like western music.

525
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,600
I will play some classical
music in this performance.”

526
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,440
I said, ‘Why not.
Let’s make something new on stage.

527
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,560
Great art comes on stage only.

528
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,920
I will play happy birthday to you.

529
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,240
I will play a wrong note.’

530
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,920
Even then it would have been fine.

531
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,480
But next day, we got on stage to discover
this phenomenon called stage fright.

532
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,240
If you don’t know what stage fright is,
let me explain.

533
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,960
There is a girl, her name is Neha.

534
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,800
She is cute.

535
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
You have been practicing for three months.

536
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,880
I will walk to Neha and say,
Neha you are cool, we should have coffee.

537
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,000
That’s what you have prepared.

538
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,080
The moment you walk up to Neha.
Your brain says

539
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,320
bye.

540
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,600
'Listen Neha...

541
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,800
Do you eat &lt;i&gt;Kanda Poha&lt;/i&gt;?

542
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,520
Will you bear my babies?

543
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,640
Two dark babies, boom boom.

544
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,640
Ajay, Vijay! Oh!

545
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,080
We will use rhyming
words to name our kids.

546
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,720
We will write poetry with our kids.’

547
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,880
Four guys on stage.

548
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,600
Brains don’t know what hands are up to.

549
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,320
But they have watched the Iron Maiden video.

550
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,480
So their expression is... Yeah!

551
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,360
Having fun, yeah!

552
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,120
Ghosh spun a drumstick.
It flew away.

553
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,800
He spun the other one.
It flew away.

554
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,400
Back to tabla.

555
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,560
&lt;i&gt;Ta dhin dhin dha...&lt;/i&gt;

556
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,840
Joseph said, “Wow!

557
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,320
Drums are fucking up.
I should do something to save this.”

558
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,280
He took his guitar and
put his foot on the amplifier.

559
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,480
*guitar noises*

560
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,880
We thought he might save us.

561
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
That very moment the sound guy shouted,

562
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
“Hey dumbfucker!

563
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,640
Remove your foot.

564
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,280
Every year guys in
IIT Kharagpur ruin my amplifier.”

565
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,040
Inside, we were nervous.
But inside, Kamlesh was Dettol.

566
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,240
He doesn’t give a fuck.

567
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,240
He saw a girl and said,

568
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,320
“Excuse me girl,
this song is dedicated to you.”

569
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,000
That girl and her friends
walked out immediately.

570
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,040
Trying to hold them back.
Kamlesh is showing off.

571
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,560
&lt;i&gt;“Welcome to the Hotel Sa Sa Re Ga...”&lt;/i&gt;

572
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,440
Judges were confused.

573
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,200
“Are they bad or are we old?

574
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,400
What is going on?”

575
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,880
There is self-doubt.

576
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,280
Kamlesh was gulping down the Dettol.

577
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,560
Security guard said,
“Sir, whisky not allowed.”

578
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,160
He said, “Dettol.”

579
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,360
Security guard was shocked.
He retired.

580
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I have seen everything.

581
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,520
I cannot comprehend anymore.

582
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,760
My brain is popcorn now.

583
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,320
I was happily playing
Happy birthday to you.

584
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Jack and Jill went up the hill...

585
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,760
All the nursery rhymes I knew.

586
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,320
&lt;i&gt;Daya kar daan bhakti
ka humein parmatma dena...&lt;/i&gt;

587
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,920
After I played this for thirty minutes,
the sound guy said,

588
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,560
“Excuse me, your guitar is not connected.”

589
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,840
'That is the perfect dream.'

590
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,480
We continued for half an hour.

591
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,240
After us, forty-eight
professional bands performed.

592
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,960
And we waited for the results.

593
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,040
Which brings us to the next segment.

594
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,320
It’s called jokes without friends.

595
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,600
These jokes have no
narrative from one to other.

596
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,560
There is no flow to them.

597
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,640
Random jokes.

598
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,720
They are on their own.

599
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,480
They came to me in lonely nights of 2016.

600
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,080
And said we came all alone.

601
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,040
I was like I relate.

602
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
So I will do the jokes.

603
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,920
Many times when you...

604
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,840
I love travelling from
place to place.

605
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,400
And some of you might have
taken an Uber here.

606
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,000
And everytime you book an Uber

607
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
they will use the lowest form of
technology available to them.

608
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,720
They have the location.
They will never use it.

609
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,240
They will call you.
“Hellaa!”

610
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,120
They never say hello.
“Hellaa!”

611
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,880
They will never start with hello,
they are talking to somebody else...

612
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,360
“Ayyyyy... Hellaaa!”

613
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,960
Who is there in your taxi?

614
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,600
Do you have friends everywhere you drive?

615
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,440
I am assuming you dropped somebody.

616
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,520
"Did you murder... Hella!"

617
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,800
The next line they will always say perfectly.

618
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,200
The moment you say, “Hello!”

619
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,880
“Yes sir!
Where do we have to come?”

620
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,400
So you just don’t know how to say hello.

621
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,840
"Hellaa!"

622
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,200
'You have to come to the location.'

623
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,800
"Location?"

624
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,080
'No. Stay there.

625
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,520
I’ll come to you in an Ola.'

626
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,120
We will go together.'

627
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,680
But I don’t blame them.

628
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Everytime you ask people
to give you some landmark.

629
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,960
If you ask your friends to come
to a landmark and call you.

630
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,800
They will come near the landmark
they’ll call you.

631
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,680
When you ask them,
‘What can you see?’

632
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,760
They will tell you some shit that’s
damn close to your house

633
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,160
but you have never heard of.

634
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,600
"Yes. So what can you see around?

635
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,720
Have you reached near Forum mall?"
- “Yes I have reached near Forum mall."

636
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,720
"What can you see?"
- "I can see a dog.

637
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,560
A cat.

638
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,640
And a female serpent."

639
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,240
"How do you know the sex of the serpent?"

640
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,080
"She was dancing."

641
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,360
If you ask people on the streets for direction
they will always judge you.

642
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,600
You ask some uncle,
“Where is Famous studio?”

643
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
“You want to go to Famous studio?”

644
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:51,840
"Not really.

645
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,040
I roam around Mumbai
and enhancing my general knowledge.

646
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,760
Tell me where all can I go?"

647
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,000
"Have you seen the Sea Link?"
- "Understand the sarcasm, uncle."

648
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
People don’t get sarcasm.

649
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,920
Have you noticed general knowledge
is always very specific.

650
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,240
"Everest is 11,343 feet tall."

651
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,920
That’s very specific.

652
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,600
Here is what general knowledge sounds like.

653
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,040
There exists Everest.

654
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,720
Very general.

655
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,040
Very knowledge.

656
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,160
One kind of people on the streets

657
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,040
that are very dangerous
are the auto drivers.

658
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,120
If you ask them to take you from
one side of Forum mall to another.

659
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,520
They will quote the highest fare
that they have rehearsed.

660
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,000
Like, 'I want to go from one side to another.
How much?'

661
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,840
"Five hundred and twenty seven rupees."

662
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,000
You are trying to negotiate.

663
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Please take this five hundred
and twenty five rupees, please.

664
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,640
Don’t try that shit.
They are used to that.

665
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,120
Which is why, you just agree.
Fucks them up.

666
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,680
'Will you go to Forum mall?'
- "Yes."

667
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,080
'How much is the fare?'
- “Five hundred and twenty seven rupees.”

668
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,200
'Let’s go.'
- "What?"

669
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,800
"Where near Forum Mall?”
- 'Police station, fucker.'

670
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,000
Let’s talk about something else that we
have in common.

671
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,880
We all love cricket. Yes cricket.
It’s really nice. Wow. Cricket.

672
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,000
I asked one of my friends,
"Are you Dhoni’s fan?"

673
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,880
He said, “No, I am Kohli's fan."

674
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,240
I said you can be a fan of both.

675
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,840
They don’t even know that you exist.

676
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,200
Why are you being faithful

677
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,720
in your 
one-dimensional hypothetical relationship?

678
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,000
It’s in your own head.

679
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,600
"How would Dhoni feel?"

680
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Do you think Dhoni is
sitting at your window?

681
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,600
“What’s he watching on TV?”

682
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,240
He’s got shit to do.

683
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,560
I don’t get sports.

684
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,080
Sports to me is a futile exercise
in thermodynamics.

685
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,720
Because people come, they do things in circles,
go back home.

686
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,880
Every four years Olympics happens,
I can’t stand it.

687
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,600
I get really angry.

688
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,000
I want to start productive Olympics.
Do something.

689
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,280
Everytime.
“I can lift 200kgs.

690
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,680
I will leave it here and go.”

691
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,480
Come to my building.

692
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,840
Lift two cylinders.

693
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,160
You shall get paid.

694
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,360
One sport that I don’t
like in particular is gymnastics.

695
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,640
Gymnastics is not a sport.

696
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,960
It’s a warm up exercise
stretched for too long.

697
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,960
Because at the end of
every sport something happens.

698
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,920
These gymnasts...
"Ummm, ummm, yeah!

699
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,240
Okay, yeah! Okay.

700
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,160
Bye."

701
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,400
Who will play tennis?

702
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,120
I bought popcorn already.

703
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,320
Why don’t you stretch at home and come.

704
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,640
Their PT sir didn’t teach them a thing.

705
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,360
He did not even know,
how to play any game.

706
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,120
He would always say...
1,2,3,4...

707
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,800
But people are mad about sports.

708
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,520
Recently there was a film made on Dhoni.

709
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,040
That teaser had come.

710
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,440
They made a film on Dhoni named ‘Dhoni’.

711
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,920
In the teaser of the film, Dhoni
is sitting on Kharagpur platform no. 8.

712
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,840
Train is approaching.

713
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,080
And Dhoni is thinking.

714
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,080
Sushant Singh Rajput is playing Dhoni.

715
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,280
Dhoni is thinking.

716
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,520
I don’t know what he is thinking.

717
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,960
If the ball comes catch it.

718
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,600
What if balls comes?
Then catch it.

719
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,480
My hipster friend watches this film
and he's like,

720
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,400
"Bro, this film isn’t realistic at all."

721
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,360
I asked why?

722
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,760
He said, “Kharagpur has no platform no. 8.”

723
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,760
I said, 'Bro if you look closely,
that’s not Dhoni either.'

724
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,240
Why is your problem
with symbolism specific?

725
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,880
Why don’t you have a problem
with the general idea of symbolism?

726
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,320
People compare reality to fiction.

727
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,840
Because people don’t get fiction.

728
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,560
People do anything.

729
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,040
People will often say this.

730
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,880
Reality is stranger than fiction.

731
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,520
Have you heard this?

732
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
Reality is stranger than fiction.

733
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,400
I don’t agree.

734
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,000
Show me one panda which can do Kung Fu.

735
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,240
One.

736
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,280
I have two sequels
and a holiday edition too.

737
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,600
Has God ever emerged in your house?

738
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,480
Reality is stranger than fiction.

739
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,120
They read random articles and say this.

740
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,240
My friend read this article...

741
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,040
The article said, “Man kisses Cobra
many times.

742
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
Dies when Cobra kisses back.”

743
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Strange.

744
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,040
But Kung Fu Panda has
a teacher who is a mouse.

745
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,120
Whose teacher was a tortoise.

746
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,640
Whose adopted child was a lion.

747
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,280
What is stranger?

748
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,480
What people mean to say, when they say
reality is stranger than fiction is this.

749
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,200
They mean to say...

750
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,720
The writer can’t even imagine the things
that happen in reality to pen them down.

751
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,920
That’s what they mean to say.

752
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,240
Such strange things happen
that the writer just can’t write.

753
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,000
So strange, wow!

754
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,280
As a writer I take offence.

755
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,800
I can write.

756
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,280
But you can't read it.

757
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,240
I will write a full book.

758
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,760
400 pages only with ‘g’.

759
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,440
Only ‘g’ not even vowels.

760
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,480
And on the last page, cow dung.

761
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,360
Not the word,
I'll literally put cow dung over there.

762
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,160
What is this?

763
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,000
Strange enough for you, motherfucker.

764
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,680
People have very low
bar for entertainment.

765
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,760
That is why I don't have to do much.

766
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,280
People are entertained by fountains.

767
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,040
The earth is taking a leak.

768
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
People are happy.

769
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,760
They started missing the fountain
during the night, so they lit it.

770
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,960
Red, blue.

771
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,720
"Wow! It's looking great.

772
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,000
Was missing this at night.

773
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,440
This revolution against gravity
that water is doing."

774
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,800
People hate gravity.

775
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,240
That’s basically what it is.

776
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,200
People just enjoy saying
fuck you to gravity.

777
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,600
They basically want to swing
and say 'fuck you' to gravity.

778
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,320
That’s all.

779
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,680
When the child is born, what do you buy?

780
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,440
Cradle.

781
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,160
Why?

782
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
When the baby is born,
it cries, so we will put it in the cradle.

783
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,240
It will work.

784
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,000
Baby is born.

785
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,720
“Why am I born?

786
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,720
Oh! I am swinging in the cradle.”

787
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,120
Then when he gets sick of that axis,

788
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,960
father takes him in his arms
and swings him up and down.

789
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
Wow! Fuck you gravity.

790
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,960
Amusement park is the answer
to ‘what if dad was an industry?’

791
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,640
They made all these rides
only to say fuck you to gravity.

792
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,160
Sitting on those rides...

793
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,600
Fuck you, gravity.

794
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
Asshole, gravity.

795
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,000
What wrong has gravity done to you?

796
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,040
Sitting on the merry go round...

797
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,560
Fuck you, gravity.

798
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,000
Potential energy, kinetic energy, wow!
What a genius!

799
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,600
That is what they do.

800
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,400
When they sit on a seesaw...

801
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,880
"Give me some potential energy, bro.

802
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,640
Take bro.

803
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,360
What did you tell gravity?

804
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,640
Oh gravity, are you shy?

805
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,120
Oh!"

806
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,120
The second thing we love is sex

807
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,680
because that is two people pendulum.

808
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Love that shit.

809
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
And if you are ugly
you don’t get much of it.

810
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,320
And I am ugly. I know this.

811
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,400
And it is not my problem.

812
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:28,920
It’s your problem.

813
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,840
You are facing this direction

814
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,680
after paying money.

815
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,560
Not my problem at all.

816
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,360
When some people are ugly what they do is,

817
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,240
they cover it up with good clothes.

818
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,560
Forget the face, look at
the wonderful clothes I am wearing.

819
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,880
I don’t get that shit.

820
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,200
I don’t care.

821
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,640
I was born wearing jeans and t-shirt.

822
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
I was born in a hospital.

823
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,680
Nurse asked me, “Diaper?”

824
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,520
I said no.

825
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,280
Please give me a swing.

826
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,400
But some people...

827
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,480
I don't get it.

828
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,880
I have a friend.

829
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,680
All my friends wear jeans t-shirt.

830
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,400
A friend outside our circle
invited me for his wedding.

831
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
He said, “Please come!”

832
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,400
I went.

833
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,600
He asked me to wear Indian clothes.

834
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,440
So I wore jeans and t-shirt
and went for the wedding.

835
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,240
At the wedding everyone wore &lt;i&gt;chudidar,
lehanga, Punjabi, dhoti, lungi.&lt;/i&gt;

836
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,480
Happily singing,
“It’s my friend’s wedding today...”

837
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,960
He asked me,
“Why aren’t you wear Indian clothes?”

838
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,560
I told him I am wearing Indian
clothes you are wearing history.

839
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:39,000
Get out and see,
everyone is wearing jeans and t-shirt.

840
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,480
The times of Raja Ram Mohan Roy are gone.

841
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,640
You have remained.

842
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,440
The second argument.

843
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,800
When you ask people,
why do you fashion?

844
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,040
Regardless of the gender
they will say this,

845
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,440
“I do it for myself.

846
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,800
I do it for myself."

847
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,680
Yes, but I am the one who must see.

848
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,200
Ninety nine percent of
the light reflected from

849
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,920
your clothes are coming into my eyes.

850
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,960
If my eyes were here
it would have been alright.

851
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,560
But your eyes are here.

852
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,040
You didn’t even see what
you are wearing since morning.

853
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,880
Final argument.

854
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,480
They'll say,
"I am making a fashion statement.

855
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,680
I am making statement with fashion, oooo!"

856
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,000
Slap!

857
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,320
Why are Hindi,
English, Devnagri, Java, C++,

858
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,200
dictionary, thesaurus there
if you wanted to make a vague statement?

859
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,440
What is that you can't
state with a language

860
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,280
that you want to state with your clothes?

861
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,360
Gandhi is protesting.

862
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Simon go back, Simon go back!

863
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,520
Simon didn’t get it.

864
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,120
You came in a V-neck and &lt;i&gt;dhoti&lt;/i&gt;.

865
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
Oh I understand.
Thank you guys, I’ll leave.

866
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,960
V for vuck off.

867
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,480
I know.

868
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,520
Every show I tell people they say,

869
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,440
"What is this?

870
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,640
What is this?

871
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
Hella!"

872
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,360
If this doesn’t make you laugh
then I don’t know what fuck will.

873
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,960
I know what will.

874
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,360
See, everyone understands sex jokes.

875
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,960
Not met a person in my motherfucking
life who doesn’t like sex jokes.

876
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,120
Everybody's like, "Oh I am sophisticated.
Sex. Ha ha ha ha!

877
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,120
Penis, vagina! Oh ho!"

878
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,040
Look I am ugly.

879
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,880
I use a tactic.

880
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,720
What am I going to do in life?

881
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,640
I will have sex with everyone.

882
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,840
Then nobody can call me ugly.

883
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,680
“You are ugly.”

884
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,400
Then why did you have sex with me?

885
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,160
This was my strategy
until I was twenty

886
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,200
two.

887
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,880
Because now I have realised that

888
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,680
the return on investment
of having sex is very low.

889
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,920
One has to invest for
the first three months.

890
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,800
"Wow! Right swipe.
Whatte!

891
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,960
Hi, Hello!

892
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,040
Yeah, I like that band.

893
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,080
Which band is this?

894
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
Yeah yeah, I like that artist.

895
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,200
What is art?"

896
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,280
Finally you meet in some restaurant.

897
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,400
Have dinner.

898
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,040
Fucking impressed.

899
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,160
Yeah yeah, impressed.

900
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,120
Then you split the bill because feminism.

901
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,680
Now...

902
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,200
Do it.

903
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:20,440
It's true.

904
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,400
Do it, fucker.

905
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,000
Do not clap!

906
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,080
Every penny should be split
otherwise I will fuck you up.

907
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,200
I will personally come and
see in every restaurant.

908
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,960
I'll stalk you.

909
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,640
Waiter will explode and I will appear.

910
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,360
Split the bill. Go home.
Beautiful ambience light. Melodious music.

911
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Have sex.

912
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,320
Your reward lasts for three seconds.

913
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,440
I don’t want to have sex.

914
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,040
What? I don’t want to have sex any more.

915
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,680
On a deposit of one crore rupees
you get an interest of one rupee.

916
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,400
And a 30% tax on that.

917
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,640
“Was it good for you?”

918
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,040
I don’t want to do it.

919
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,800
Now I am happy by knowing
that I can have sex.

920
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,120
I go to girls.

921
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,280
And I’m like, “Can we sex?”

922
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,000
And if they say yes.

923
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,760
I say bye.

924
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,600
I don’t want to.

925
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,080
If you give a man an orgasm
he is happy for three seconds.

926
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,160
Give a man consent
he can masturbate for life.

927
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,120
I know somebody will tweet to me
after this, saying Biswa is a sexist pig.

928
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,280
Maybe I am sexist.
But what did the pig do?

929
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,720
Pig is joyously devouring excreta.

930
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,720
Great.

931
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,120
I know.

932
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,680
Some of you are uncomfortable.

933
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,840
Let me make you more.

934
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,360
Dick pics are wrong and
you should not send them.

935
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,760
Okay.

936
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,120
That’s the disclaimer.

937
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,480
The umbrella under
which this joke functions.

938
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,880
Do not disagree with that.

939
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,480
However I think dick pics do
have a silver lining

940
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,760
if the flash is on.

941
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,560
Yeah!

942
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,440
Yeah!

943
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,400
Yeah!

944
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,640
Some people used brains.

945
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:15,560
Other are like...

946
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,040
What’s this? Please slap a
slapstick punchline and I shall laugh.

947
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,960
Why is this show a commentary on itself?

948
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,080
This comedian is too self aware.

949
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,960
And now I am too.

950
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,320
Should not send dick pics.

951
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,880
Because...

952
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,840
See.

953
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,800
There is a silver lining to a dick pic...

954
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,880
If someone sends a dick pic,

955
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,760
it saves time.

956
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,640
Rather than lying for four
years that I am your friend.

957
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,280
As soon as you have a breakup,

958
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,000
I want to sex you.

959
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:45,960
Better option is...

960
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,800
send a dick pic.

961
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,080
Immediate rejection.

962
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,280
You should not do it but I am saying

963
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,080
like there is some silver lining.

964
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,520
Sending dick pics is wrong because...

965
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,520
Consent.

966
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,880
When you send a dick pic

967
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,920
somebody has to see it without consent.

968
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,880
So one afternoon you are writing
a software and suddenly

969
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,760
a dick.

970
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,800
I don’t want to see it.

971
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,640
Why should you not send dick pics?

972
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,280
Instead, write dick pic

973
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,200
and send a link.

974
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,640
Whoever wants to see it will see.

975
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,640
With consent.

976
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:28,120
I had written dick pic,
what did you expect, a bear?

977
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,360
Most brands want to stay
away from anything sexual.

978
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,160
We want to pretend
like everything is nice.

979
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,760
Like there are no curse words.

980
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,560
They think there are
no curse words in this world.

981
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,080
They want to show everything is nice.

982
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,960
Like there is a new product
in the market, instant noodles.

983
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,960
Its tagline,

984
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,960
“Beat up hunger.”

985
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,200
I think brands should be honest.

986
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,000
Your first line of creativity is honesty.

987
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,640
You want to talk to the youth,
talk honestly.

988
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,720
Your tagline should be,

989
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,720
Instant noodles...

990
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,760
“&lt;i&gt;Le Bencho Kha&lt;/i&gt;.”

991
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,440
Who will not try?

992
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,200
When guys in hostels are hungry
and they don’t know what to eat.

993
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,560
“&lt;i&gt;Le Bencho Kha&lt;/i&gt;.”
He will eat that only.

994
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,240
All food is poison but this man is honest.

995
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,400
I am so inspired by this idea

996
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,080
that I want to start my
chain of restaurants called ‘&lt;i&gt;Le Bencho&lt;/i&gt;’.

997
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,880
I will position it as a French restaurant

998
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,800
Next to every ‘Au Bon Pain’,
we'll have ‘&lt;i&gt;Le Bencho&lt;/i&gt;’.

999
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
When the Queen of England comes in,

1000
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:31,800
and she asks for Indian food.

1001
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,760
“&lt;i&gt;Le Bencho Kha&lt;/i&gt;.”

1002
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,400
You took our spices
now bear the curse words.

1003
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,400
That’s the end of that segment.

1004
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,280
You may applaud if you desire so.

1005
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,680
The final story is about me
like the rest of this fucking show.

1006
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,640
This is a story about
me trying to be cool.

1007
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,680
Like the rest of the fucking show.

1008
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:03,600
This story takes place in eighth
standard right after sixth standard.

1009
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:08,040
And this story is about me
trying to be cool by playing sports.

1010
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,440
As you know,

1011
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,440
sports is great.

1012
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,080
Sports is the ultimate way of being cool.

1013
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:16,720
Like in international cricket
there are 11 players who play cricket.

1014
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,880
In domestic cricket
there are eleven players

1015
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,280
who play cricket and a guy
who picks up the ball from the drain.

1016
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,080
Yours truly, always.

1017
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,200
I was born like this.

1018
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,960
I always used to take out
the ball from the drain hoping

1019
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,880
that some day they will
make me a part of the team.

1020
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,320
But they never did.

1021
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,440
When I was born, they said,

1022
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,760
“Go get the ball from the drain.”

1023
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I said, 'I just came into this world.'

1024
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,040
“You can talk.

1025
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:41,400
You also wear jeans and t-shirt.

1026
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,640
So why can’t you get
the ball from the drain?”

1027
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,360
Why are you guys so surreal?

1028
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,760
But I used to dream a lot.

1029
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,960
Whenever Ganguly hit a century,

1030
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,680
I used to think,

1031
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,600
What is this?
Only 100 runs in 50 overs?

1032
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,920
When I will play cricket,
I will hit a six on every single ball.

1033
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,600
Sixes on 300 balls.
That would make a total score of 1800.

1034
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,720
My friend said,

1035
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,400
“Excuse me, actually batting
changes after every over.”

1036
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,240
I said, 'Oh no problem.
In every alternative over

1037
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,640
six sixes in each ball,
a total score of 900.'

1038
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,600
He said, “Oh okay! Why don’t
you hit six on every first five balls

1039
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,120
and a single on every last ball?”

1040
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,720
I said, 'Oh nice, thirty one.

1041
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,680
Thirty one multiplied by fifty.
1550.'

1042
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,440
He said, “Yeah but why are you taking
a single run on the last ball?

1043
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,480
Hit a six.”

1044
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,440
I said cool.

1045
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,760
Fifteen fifty six.

1046
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,360
He said, “No.
You are taking only 49 singles now.”

1047
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,120
I agreed, 'Yes fifteen fifty five.'

1048
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,800
He said, “Good, now get
the ball from the drain.”

1049
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,920
This was me.
And I used to sit on the last bench

1050
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,800
because of very popular
public policy height wise.

1051
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,200
Indian education system couldn’t
come up with sloped classrooms

1052
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,560
so they came up with sloped children.

1053
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,720
If your genetics are good, go to the back.

1054
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,880
No need to listen just
watch a Charlie Chaplin film.

1055
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:01,160
All the boys who used to sit with me
in the class had failed and reached there.

1056
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,840
They had failed many times.

1057
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,680
They started from the first row.

1058
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,680
They failed. Shifted to second row.

1059
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,360
Failed again. Third row.

1060
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,240
Failed again. Fourth row.

1061
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,920
And all had dark skin for some reason.

1062
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,280
If you are insoluble in Indian education system
you will slowly precipitate.

1063
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,480
Slowly you will reach the last bench.

1064
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,800
I don't even know their fucking names.

1065
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,000
We'll call them Deepak.

1066
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,120
We'll call them Deepak.

1067
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,240
All dark skinned.

1068
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,680
Hair on the chest, so long

1069
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:29,960
which they cut in the classroom.

1070
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,120
While history teacher is teaching,
these guys object.

1071
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,840
“Shah Jahan made Taj Mahal
in the memory of Mumtaz.”

1072
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,800
“No madam, since she died he dedicated
it for good PR.”

1073
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,320
“How do you know?”

1074
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,640
“I was there.”

1075
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,520
All the six Deepaks are sitting.

1076
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,000
There is no hope in their lives.

1077
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,520
They are in eighth standard
and their child is in seventh standard.

1078
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,320
Son.

1079
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,280
They talk during the recess.

1080
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,200
“Why did you copy my signature?”

1081
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,760
“But papa my name is Deepak too.”

1082
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,560
These are ‘Deepaks’.

1083
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,120
Even life, doesn’t respect them.

1084
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,320
There was one more character, PT sir.

1085
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,520
In Indian schools PT teachers
don’t get any respect.

1086
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,520
Nobody respects him.

1087
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,640
Because PT teacher
tries to show off so hard.

1088
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,360
Maths teacher teaches 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

1089
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,400
PT teacher comes in the
morning and says, “1,2,1...

1090
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,720
1,2,1.”

1091
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,120
Hey you should say left right left.

1092
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,320
Why are you trying to show off binary?

1093
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,160
This is...

1094
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,840
This 1,2,3,4.

1095
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,200
This is 1,2,1.

1096
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,360
But PT teacher won’t understand.

1097
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,520
He just doesn’t understand anything.

1098
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,000
It is early winter morning.

1099
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,040
PT teacher says, “Attention.”

1100
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,960
Students stand straight.
PT teacher says, “Stand at ease.”

1101
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,920
We were standing at ease earlier.

1102
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,880
Why you raised false alarm, bitch?

1103
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,680
And what kind of resting position is this?

1104
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,640
I am not feeling rested at all.

1105
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,640
This is very close to ‘attention’ guys.

1106
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,520
You should come to my house
to know how I rest.

1107
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,920
At least horizontal.

1108
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,000
Then he says, “Easy.”

1109
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,520
I can only shake my hands with ease.

1110
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,880
I thought, 'Till I have my underpants on,

1111
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:22,880
I can not stand with ease.'

1112
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,320
PT teacher.

1113
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,960
That is why everyone used
to gossip about PT teacher’s affair.

1114
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,800
They will find somebody.

1115
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,640
“Do you know that PT teacher
and English madam are ‘full on’.”

1116
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,400
Full on.

1117
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,040
Nobody exactly knew what full on meant.

1118
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,920
What is the exact sexual process?

1119
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:39,680
No sex education.

1120
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,320
No nothing.

1121
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,520
But full on.

1122
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,600
Deepaks used to explain their juniors.

1123
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,920
“Do you know last year, full on?”

1124
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:48,680
Our PT teacher was fed up.

1125
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,440
He was a short guy, curly hair,
four feet, fed up.

1126
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,880
He said, “I want to do
something useful in life.”

1127
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,080
One day he got an idea.

1128
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,320
There was an interschool basketball
championship coming up near our school.

1129
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,520
He said, “We will participate.

1130
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,520
We will make our school team.

1131
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,960
And win the trophy.”

1132
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,800
But...

1133
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,520
He came up with a genius idea.
He was like,

1134
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,640
I want to do something that has never
been tried in basketball history before.

1135
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,760
I will make a team of

1136
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,640
tall people.

1137
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,880
What a genius!

1138
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,400
Then he went and jerked off for two hours.

1139
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Wow!
I am such a genius.

1140
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,560
Then he came back.

1141
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,280
And thanks to popular
public policy height wise.

1142
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,400
His dialogue was reduced to one line,

1143
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,480
He came into the classroom and said,
“Come on last bench. Let’s go.”

1144
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,920
All the Deepaks and I left.

1145
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,680
Then he said,
“You are part of the sports team.”

1146
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,120
I had a spark in my eyes.

1147
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,040
I said, 'Sir where is the drain?'

1148
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,560
I will get into it.
I will churn the ocean.

1149
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,200
You throw a ball,
I will bring back three balls.

1150
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,880
Professional level drain.

1151
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,600
I will get in from the
drain and come out of the tap.

1152
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,920
What you know PT teacher?

1153
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,200
I am genius.

1154
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,720
PT teacher said,
“You are part of the team.”

1155
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,680
You and all Deepaks are parts of the team.

1156
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,520
Deepaks got excited.

1157
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,440
“Sir, are you trying to tell us

1158
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,920
that we have to do something
other than disappoint?”

1159
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,480
PT teacher said, “Yes, you
have to put the ball in the basket.”

1160
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,040
Deepaks went mad.

1161
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,360
At that point we realised that
within the radius of 20 km from our school...

1162
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,480
It was such a small town.

1163
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,960
There was not one basketball court
next to our school.

1164
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,920
But PT teacher was full of positivity.

1165
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,160
Short heighted man.

1166
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:29,760
This short.

1167
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,840
He took a rod.

1168
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,200
Turned it and fixed it in the wall.

1169
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,880
He said, “Where there is a wall,
there is a basketball.”

1170
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,680
We said, “Idiot you could have
learnt something from English madam.

1171
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,520
You don’t even know the basic proverbs.

1172
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,240
Will you spend your
entire life by saying 1,2,1?”

1173
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,960
He got a football and said,
“Put it in the basket.”

1174
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,040
The basket was right here

1175
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,240
so me and Deepaks put
the ball in the basket.

1176
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,360
PT teacher jerked off for another two hours.

1177
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,480
He said, “What a genius idea.”

1178
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,760
I knew this tall people
gamble will pay off.

1179
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,160
He said, “Do something creative.”

1180
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,080
So we threw the ball
from under the basket.

1181
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:03,680
He said, “Wow!”

1182
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:04,680
What a...

1183
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,480
This time he went and had sex.

1184
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,720
Then he said, “Let’s not delay.

1185
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,400
Let’s go to the interschool
basketball championship,

1186
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,960
play and come back as winners.”

1187
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,080
I told ma that I am going to
play and will come back with the trophy.

1188
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,520
Ma said,
“You don’t have a future in sports.”

1189
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,680
I said you will see.

1190
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,360
Slippers on my feet,

1191
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,120
half pants,

1192
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,000
football in the hand

1193
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,720
and eyes full of dreams.

1194
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,120
Six Deepaks and I,

1195
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,120
sat on a Swaraj Mazda.

1196
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,880
To sink our dreams.

1197
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,920
If you don’t know Swaraj Mazda.

1198
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:38,520
Look it up.

1199
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,680
Swaraj Mazda is basically

1200
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,240
one day an auto and a
truck had a one night stand.

1201
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,760
A car came out which always
got confused at the toll booth.

1202
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,840
“Am I heavy or am I light?”

1203
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,480
Swaraj Mazda.

1204
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,680
Choice of vehicle for
all kinds of immersions.

1205
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,840
Sentence too complex.

1206
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,800
Now, we reached the place.

1207
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,160
DPS, Nalco Nagar.

1208
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,760
Where, for the first time,
we saw a basketball.

1209
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,400
Then we saw a basket.

1210
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,200
Then we saw two baskets.

1211
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,040
We said, “Oh fuck!”

1212
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,160
PT teacher said, “Don’t worry

1213
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,280
you are tall, basket is tall

1214
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,240
this is not the game we had
expected but this is a game we deserve.”

1215
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,840
We said, “Dark Knight hasn’t been
written yet and you know the dialogues?”

1216
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,640
He said it’s the English teacher.

1217
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,080
We were astonished, “How
can you connect everything?”

1218
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:39,800
Too surreal PT teacher.

1219
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,320
Then the other team arrived.

1220
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,960
We were looking at this.

1221
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,640
Their team came.

1222
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:53,560
In their team everyone was
wearing jerseys, sports shoes.

1223
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,800
And everyone had their names
on their jerseys.

1224
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,000
Aakash, Prakash, Vijay.

1225
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,120
They were wearing shoes.

1226
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:58,600
We said, “What kind of idiots are these?”

1227
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,640
They will take time
to take off their shoes.

1228
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,320
We are ready.

1229
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,640
There were four cheer leaders with each player.

1230
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,080
Four cheer leaders with each player.

1231
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,560
They cheered, "Wohoo..."

1232
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,960
Game didn’t even start... Wohoo!

1233
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,240
What an annoying noise.

1234
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,520
‘Wohoo’ is the worst motivational
speech in the fucking world.

1235
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,080
What is this?

1236
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,760
If somebody is dying and

1237
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:33,560
you do ‘Wohoo’,
his ghost will do wohoo in your kitchen everyday.

1238
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,320
Fucking wohoo!

1239
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,000
How irritating!

1240
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,880
Are you a human or a cuckoo bird?

1241
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,400
Wohoo!

1242
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,840
I get so pissed.

1243
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,600
I think we should fit
it in every ambulance.

1244
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,960
People will immediately
give way to others.

1245
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,840
Someone is going on a road.

1246
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,640
From behind ‘wohoo’.

1247
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,000
Go fucker.

1248
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,440
Save your old man.

1249
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,520
Go live your life.

1250
00:54:58,440 --> 00:54:59,960
Wohoo, Wohoo, Wohoo!

1251
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,120
Fucking hate that shit.

1252
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,760
Then...

1253
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,920
We saw that everybody were
not tall in their team.

1254
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,280
Some were tall. Some were short.

1255
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,120
We were like, look at this.

1256
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,880
Don’t know the basic laws.

1257
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,320
This is unpopular
public policy skill wise.

1258
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,440
Soon to be decimated by
popular public policy height wise.

1259
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,560
The match began.

1260
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,240
The ball went up.

1261
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:33,560
And then never came in our hands.

1262
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,200
They were passing the ball to each other.

1263
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,560
We said, “Give it to us.”

1264
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,680
Guests are equal to Gods.

1265
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,280
We have come from far.
Our eyes full of dreams.

1266
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,400
If you don’t give us the
ball how are we going to play?

1267
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,920
They kept playing with the ball.

1268
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,240
Dribble dribble dribble.

1269
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,120
We said, “Guys this is a
basketball and not a yo-yo ball.

1270
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:53,800
Why are you throwing it to the ground?”

1271
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,640
Ball, basket, shortest distance.

1272
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,320
We know it from state board.

1273
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,840
How can you be doing this from CBSE board?

1274
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:02,280
They just wouldn't give us the ball.

1275
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,120
So one of our teammates
went and tried to take the ball.

1276
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,120
He made a foul.

1277
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,240
Referee blew the whistle.

1278
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:09,800
We were playing such
a lousy game that...

1279
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,240
the cheer leaders left.

1280
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,560
The cheer leaders fucking left.

1281
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,320
Have you ever been so ugly
that somebody else had a break up?

1282
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,160
Have you ever been so cursed that

1283
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,680
someone else’s marriage
broke because of you?

1284
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,280
Priest sees you and surrenders,
"I can’t do it any more.

1285
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,160
My career is over.
I cannot perform any more marriages.”

1286
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,200
Throw flowers at him,

1287
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,760
“How ugly!

1288
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,200
Why do you have teeth
coming out of your eyes?”

1289
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,360
Too ugly.

1290
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,920
One of the Deepaks just couldn’t stand it.

1291
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:44,800
Alright.

1292
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:45,600
They were not giving us the ball.

1293
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:46,680
Cheer leaders had walked off.

1294
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,720
There was no motivation left in his life.

1295
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:48,960
He said, “I want the ball.”

1296
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,600
The guy from the opposite team
was running away dribbling the ball.

1297
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,960
"Oh! Career ahead.

1298
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,520
Oh privilege."

1299
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,320
He was running.

1300
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,560
Deepak went and he touched him.

1301
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,800
Not much.

1302
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,080
He said, “Rules are only
applicable if you are afraid.

1303
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,560
I don’t give a fuck.”

1304
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,200
Deepak only touched him.

1305
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,680
The other guy fell to the ground.

1306
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,160
“Oh, I am dead.

1307
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,360
Oh my God, what a f...

1308
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,640
I have fractured my neck.”

1309
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:17,960
Hey!

1310
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,880
And I don’t doubt him
because you have to understand.

1311
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,520
Deepak from state board
has been beaten up by headmaster,

1312
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,920
principal. Even PT teacher has thrashed him.

1313
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,440
All the Deepaks used to beat him up.

1314
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,160
Even his own kid used to slap him.

1315
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,400
Shah Jahan had also beaten him.

1316
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,920
Even I have beaten him.

1317
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,440
The ball has also beaten him.

1318
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,080
Deepak’s bones are very strong.
Full of calcium.

1319
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:37,360
Full of stalactite, stalagmite.

1320
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,120
Meanwhile Aakash from CBSE board

1321
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,320
has only experienced hugs and kisses.

1322
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,000
Deepak touched once and
natural selection took over.

1323
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,480
“Oh, I am going to die.”

1324
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,000
“You should not have been born
at the first place as Darwin said."

1325
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,320
Deepak, what English man!

1326
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,320
“Well, I was Darwin’s friend.”

1327
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,080
Cheer leaders...

1328
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,600
Cheer leaders took Aakash on a stretcher.

1329
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,280
Wohoo, wohoo, wohoo!

1330
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,720
Four cheer leaders took him away.

1331
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,360
Full road was empty.

1332
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,360
Hypothesis proven.

1333
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,680
Deepak don’t give a fuck.

1334
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,040
Deepak said, “I must score a basket.”

1335
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,240
Match was over.

1336
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,080
He said, “We have come so far, 
I must score a basket.”

1337
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,240
Deepak took the ball.

1338
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,520
We all cheered, “Deepak! Deepak!”

1339
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,800
They are also Deepaks.

1340
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,840
Deepak took the ball and threw it.

1341
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,640
The ball crossed the basket.

1342
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:32,320
It crossed DPS, Nalco Nagar.

1343
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,600
And with all our dreams,

1344
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:34,920
the ball went into the drain.

1345
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,000
Thank you guys you
have been an amazing audience.

1346
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,880
Give it up for yourselves.

1347
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,760
Thank you.

1348
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,200
Thank you very much.

1349
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,000
Yes.

1350
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,760
Alright.

1351
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,400
Thank you guys.

1352
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,040
Anything else you all need to know?

1353
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,520
Thank you very much
for coming for the show.

1354
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,320
Give yourselves a round of applause.

1355
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,120
Clap for yourselves.

1356
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:53,840
Thank you!

1357
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,560
Drive safe. Good night.
