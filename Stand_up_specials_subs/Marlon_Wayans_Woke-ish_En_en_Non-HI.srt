1
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:15,223
How the fuck we doing, DC?
We good?

2
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,789
That music gets you hyped, man.

3
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,250
I see why there's
so many shootouts in hip-hop clubs.

4
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:47,797
It's the music, man. Make you feel like
you punched your best friend in the face.

5
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,467
"I'm hyped! I'll punch a nigga
in the face with a right!"

6
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,805
"Damn. My bad, Larry. Shit.

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,893
You did the same shit to me
with that Lil Uzi song last week.

8
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,353
No. You shot me right there."

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,565
I, like, still party. You know?

10
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,401
Yeah, I'm 45. I'm a...yeah.

11
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,448
You know that black don't crack
unless you smoke it.

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,787
No, but I still party.
I'm like an old-young nigga.

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,704
Like...

14
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,289
You know what I mean?
Like...

15
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,625
I'm not like the nigga
that wears the Fubu and the...

16
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,087
and the Lugz and the big puffy jacket,

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,672
with the receding hairline
and the Yankee cap. I ain't him.

18
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,551
I'm the skinny jeans,
new 2.0, young-old nigga.

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,887
No. And then girls, when they dance,

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,765
they come real low and I'm like,
"Hey, I'm young in the face

21
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,475
and old in the knees. You..."

22
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,520
They be going down here, like, "Hey..."

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,939
I'm like, "Baby,
I can't follow you down there.

24
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,609
When I get to L-position,
my black ass come right back up."

25
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,612
No. 'Cause I don't wanna be
that nigga that go down,

26
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,405
try and chase it, like, "Hey..."

27
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
And your old ass gets stuck down there,

28
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,952
and she got to help you up.

29
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,788
And you hear your knees pop
on the way up,

30
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,123
"Pop, pop, pop, pop!"

31
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,625
It's so loud, niggas think they shooting,
"Pop, pop, pop!"

32
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,168
"Oh, shit! They shooting!"

33
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,963
"Naw, they ain't shooting.
That's just my knees, man."

34
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,883
I can't commit physically to a song

35
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,261
until I know what the fucking words are.

36
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,180
I'm sorry, these...
Lyrics to these songs be crazy.

37
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,474
They be like,
"I'm sucking dick in the closet..."

38
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,767
"Naw, I'm good on that.

39
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,902
Nah. I'mma sit this one out.
I'm waiting for some Usher to come on,

40
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:33,987
something safe.

41
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,910
I'm saying, you know the good part
of the song's coming on...

42
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,329
You know, it's funny, like, you could tell
when the good part come on

43
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,125
'cause, brothers, we be like,
"Oh! This my shit, right here!"

44
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,836
It's funny 'cause black women
start stretching on your ass...

45
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,798
It be like, "Aw, this my song right here!
I'm about to twerk the shit out...

46
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,011
No. I'mma twerk the shit
out this, girl.

47
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,598
I dislocated my clitoris,
popping my pussy to this."

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,562
"Girl, I broke my hymen twice
on this part.

49
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:08,730
Right here."

50
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,526
Some of these rappers,
they spend their money

51
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,195
on frivolous shit.
You know what they need?

52
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,406
They need, like,
some financial advisors.

53
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,868
They need to sit down with a nigga
that's Charles Schwab or Merrill Lynch,

54
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,119
you know,
before they write they rhymes.

55
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,330

69
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,759
Look, you hear the spatter
of Republican laughter.

70
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,721
Only the people with money could laugh
at that last joke.

71
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:24,931
People with money was like...

You know, but I realize
that I'm old school, man.

74
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,452
I like old-school hip-hop.
I like, like, "Rapper's Delight."

75
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,292
'Cause "Rapper's Delight"
was such a fun song, you know?

76
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,836
It was fun.
The lyrics was easy to remember.

77
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,171
It's like Dr. Seuss wrote
that motherfucker.

78
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,798
It was happy.

79
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,634
It was, like, hip-hop
even white people could enjoy.

I ain't trying to be a hater.
You know, I like some of today's artists.

96
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:53,644

I love...I love Jay-Z.

98
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,067
You know, what I love
about Jay-Z is that...

99
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:04,238
he's an artist that matures
and his music matures with him.

100
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,450
You know, like,
right now his new album, <i>4:44</i>.

101
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,535
He's talking about grown man shit.

102
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,206
Stuff that's relevant to grown-ass men.
You know what I'm saying?

103
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,917
Like, he's talking about, like, marriage,

104
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,460
and children,

105
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,797
and family legacy and wealth,

106
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,132
and cheating on your wife.

107
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,843
And getting caught.

108
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,096
And getting your ass beat

109
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,348
in the elevator
by her crazy little sister.

110

You know,
shit that happens to grown folks.

111
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,771
That shit happened to me twice last year.

But see, some of these rappers be rhyming
like they 25 years old.

00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,555
And I like Future, but see...

132
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,225

this brother need rehab.

All his songs,

135
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,149
he's mixing some kind
of weird drug combination.

136
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,234
His new song, <i>Mask Off</i>...

137
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:09,363
He's mixing Molly with Percocet.

138
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,617
Nigga, that's a bad drug combination.

139
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,994

But Molly and Percocet?

147
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,648
And that's a hit song.

148
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,235

<i>♪ We put it in a cup♪</i>

153
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,285
<i>♪ Crack cocaine and baby aspirin ♪</i>

154
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,453
<i>♪ Don't be crazy♪</i>

<i>♪ Give it to your baby♪</i>

<i>♪ Crack cocaine and baby aspirin♪</i>

157
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,090
But at least I understand the words
that's coming out of Future's mouth.

158
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,425
Right?
I understand the lyrics.

159
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,927
I understand what he's saying.

160
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,053
Now...

161
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,223
Can somebody please,
be kind enough to tell me...

162
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,184
What in the entire fuck...

163
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,272
is Desiigner saying in the song "Panda"?

164
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,652
Who the fuck gave Buckwheat a record deal?

165
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,033
Like, I understand
the first lyrics, right?

166
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,494
<i>♪ I got broads in Atlanta♪</i>

167
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,330
And then this nigga lose me.

168
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,128
<i>♪ Legacy panda♪</i>

169
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>♪ Black car look like a panda♪</i>

170
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,809
Okay, nigga. So, how high were you
when you wrote this fucking song?

171
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,186
Like, how did this happen?
Was ya in your house?

172
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,188
You had a party,
there was girls over.

173
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,025
You know, you were smoking weed,
got paranoid and shit,

174
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,277
and started hallucinating.
You came out your house, you was, like,

175
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,154
<i>♪ I got broads in Atlanta♪</i>

176
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,539
<i>♪ White Legacy panda♪</i>

177
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,796
<i>♪ The black car♪</i>

178
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,923
<i>♪ It look like a panda♪</i>

179
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,264
You don't understand.

180
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,642
Nigga, when I first...
When I first heard this song, right?

181
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:46,270
My son walks by me...
The boy's not even saying lyrics.

182
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,647
I don't know what the fuck...

183
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,399
He walk by, he just making noises.
Just strange sounds.

184
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,942
He walk by me going...

185
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,126
I pulled his mommy to the side.

186
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,961
We called the doctor.

187
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,090
I thought this little nigga had
Tourette's syndrome.

188
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,428
Throughout the entire song,
Desiigner is screaming...

189
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,266
That shit sound painful.

190
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,186
That sound like the inaudible sound
that you make

191
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,438
when you go to take a piss
in the middle of the night,

192
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:30,648
in a dark room,

193
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,400
and you bust your toe...

194
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,403
on a piece of furniture

195
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,280
that ain't got no fucking business
being in the bedroom,

196
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,534
but your girl thought it was cute.
You know what I'm saying?

197
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,412
So, you go to take a piss
and you be like, "Aw, shit..."

198
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,093
And your girl wake up,
knowing it's her fault.

199
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,803
She put the shit there, like,

200
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,847
"You okay?"

201
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,433
No, bitch, I ain't okay.

202
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,061
What the fuck you got a goddamn
treasure chest in the damn bedroom for?

203
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,439
The fuck are you, a pirate?

204
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,942
When do you make that noise?

205
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,986
That's the sound I'd make...

206
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,822
if somebody was to wax...

207
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,204
this part of my asshole.

208
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,711
You know that weird meat
between your ass and your balls, fellas?

209
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,384
It's a weird little area because there
look like there should be a vagina there,

210
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,096
but God was like, "Come on,
you can't have a pussy and a dick.

211
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,056
Sew that shit up, Jesus."

212
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,057
"Okay, Dad."

213
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:54,440
And it got them weird,
scraggly hairs on it.

214
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,610
The hair don't grow right there.
It's all scraggly and sparse.

215
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,572
But it lay down. It look
like LeBron James' hairline right here.

216
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:12,708
But if your hair's real nappy and shit,
it look like Kevin Durant's.

217
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,135
But it's a weird little area,
this little place, right?

218
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,429
Because it's real sensitive, right?

219
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,307
It's the part on your body
where your girl lick, fellas, right?

220
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,975
And it feels really good.

221
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,520
It make you make all kind
of little weird, tickly noises, like...

222
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:39,401
It feels so good, you'll be making noises
like a white girl in a lesbian porno.

223
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,196
You'll be like,
"Oh, my fucking God! Fuck yeah!

224
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,951
Fuck yeah! Lick my fucking gooch!
Lick my fucking gooch!"

225
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,749
But you know when she lick it,
you feel a little bit gay when she do it?

226
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:55,501
You be conflicted, like,

227
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,461
"Oh, my God, suck my ass!
Here, suck my dick!

228
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,839
Make me straight again!
Go back down! Lick my gooch!

229
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,341
Lick the taint! Come back up!
Make me straight again!

230
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,718
Okay, listen. Don't tell nobody, okay?

231
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:10,057
You promise you ain't going
to tell nobody?

232
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:15,020
Nah, nah, 'cause when you get mad,
you be saying all my fucking business.

233
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,649
You promise you ain't going
to tell nobody?

234
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,235
All right. I'm going to trust you.

235
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,696
Here. Go on, get all that gooch.

236
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:28,826
Oh, my fucking God!
Get my fucking gooch! Fuck yeah!

237
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:33,122
Hold on, get the dick, too.
We call that the Doberman pinscher tail."

238
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:43,257
Well, if somebody was to wax
that part of my asshole,

239
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,633
I'd make that noise.

240
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,683
Thank y'all for coming out, man.
I chose DC to film my first special.

241
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,977
'Cause the first place I came to perform...

242
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,770
I went to Howard University.

243
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,358
That's right. HU!

244
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,862
Yeah, I didn't graduate.
I know all that shit. I just...

245
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,575
I only went for three semesters, but...

246
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,162
Then <i>In Living Color</i> came on. I was, like,
"Bye, niggas, I'm gonna get rich!

247
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,749
Fuck your school, nigga!
Fuck your school!

248
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,751
Fuck your positivity, niggas!

249
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,466
It's great to hear y'all laughter, man,
because this world is going through shit,

250
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,136
and laughter is healing
and I think we all need to do more of it.

251
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,226
Man, you look at the world,
we got hurricanes,

252
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,355
we got earthquakes, fires, floods.

253
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,190
It's fucking armageddon.

254
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,942
And you know who I blame?

255
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,028
I blame the Kardashians. See...

256
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,368
They are ruining this world,
one Negro at a time.

257
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,666
I don't know what is
in the vagina of a Kardashian,

258
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,710
but I think they got Zika
in there for niggas.

259
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,465
It's like, as soon as you put your dick
in a Kardashian, their vagina sucks...

260
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,053
all the talent...

261
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,598
out your dick. Just...

262
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,059
It leaves you weak.

263
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,573
Everyone that bang 'em.

264
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,535
They need to do the movie <i>Get Out...</i>

265
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,999
about the goddamn Kardashian family<i>.</i>

266
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,419
I'll make that my next movie.
<i>Haunted House 3</i>, right?

267
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,423
You know, I'm dating one of 'em.
It's like Khloe, Kim, or Kletus...

268
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,343
You know, all them niggas start with a K.
And I walk up and see Kanye West and go,

269
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,762
"Hey, Kanye! Hey, man,
let's take a picture!"

270
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,764
We take a picture. The flash goes off...

271
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,852
That nigga's nose start bleeding.

272
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,354
He snaps out of a trance,
he grabs my hand, he goes,

273
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,523
"Get out! Get out! Get out!"

274
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,985
They drag him away, right?
And I get scared, so I run outside.

275
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,487
And I see Lamar Odom.

276
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,991
He's all cracked out,
doing this shit here.

277
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,833
I look upstairs, like...
I see Caitlyn Jenner.

278
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,218
Looking in the mirror.
The motherfucker's wig fall off.

279
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:36,346
He got a scar going across his forehead.

280
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,975
You know what that scar is?
From all them damn face surgeries.

281
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,852
But here's the thing.
I know I'm talking shit

282
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,687
about the Kardashian family,

283
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,273
but I want to say this
and say it out loud.

284
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:51,695
I respect them and I applaud them
for embracing Bruce for being Caitlyn.

285
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,572
'Cause, you know, that shit is hard, man.

286
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,617
That shit is hard on your family
'cause love and unconditional acceptance

287
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,534
is a motherfucker.

288
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,453
And I don't know if we all got
that property in us.

289
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,412
That's hard.

290
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,664
I call myself woke, but not all the way.

291
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,917
I'm up, nigga, but I'm not...I'm woke-ish!

292
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,462
'Cause I still see the world and go,
"All right, I accept it,

293
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,380
but here's what's funny
about that motherfucker."

294
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,509
I think it's beautiful
that they accept him and I know it's hard

295
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,135
on the family.
I could tell at the ESPYs.

296
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:18,347
When Caitlin was giving a speech
and she wanted to thank the family?

297
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:23,060
She was like,
"I just want to thank my children..."

298
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,775
She always moving her mouth around,
look like a black man that...

299
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,528
You know how black people taste the food
before the shit is ready and it's hot?

300
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:35,155
And you trying to cool it off
and chew it at the same time.

301
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,331
"I just want to thank my children...

302
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:50,671
for loving me as the beautiful butterfly
I was born to be..."

303
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,174
And the camera pan to the kids.

304
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,262
And they was like, "What in the fuck?"

305
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,935
Nigga, Kim Kardashian started slowly
sinking in her seat, like,

306
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,521
"Nigga, that ain't my daddy.
My daddy dead.

307
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,650
That's just some strange nigga
my mama was banging

308
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,235
for his Wheaties' money.

309
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:17,030
Speaking of banging strange niggas,
come on, Kanye, let's get up outa here."

310
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,826
"Aw, Khloe, you ain't got to worry
with your big, ol' ass.

311
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,871
We all know OJ is your real daddy, so..."

312
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,876
Aw, nigga, tell me
she don't look like the Juice!

313
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,338
Put a black glove on Khloe,
I bet you that shit won't fit.

314
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,841
Here's how I know she's OJ's, okay?

315
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,342
I seen her at the airport.

316
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,304
She's trying to rent a Hertz Rent-a-Car.

317
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,806
And the bitch was jumping over luggage.

318
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,856
And if Bruce wanna be Caitlyn,
I'm fine with that,

319
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,941
but, see, we live in America,

320
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,070
and we still have
the fucking freedom of speech.

321
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,115
I have the right to have an opinion,
the right to have a thought

322
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,951
because I live in America
and the First Amendment says

323
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,453
we have freedom of speech.

324
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,497
It's the most important Amendment.
That's right.You know why?

325
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,210
Yes. 'Cause I went to public school
and they didn't teach the fucking rest.

326
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,798
So, if Bruce want to be Caitlin...
You want to cut your dick off...

327
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,967
Hey, man, more pussy for me.

328
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,805
But I'm still entitled
to have my opinion, right, bro?

329
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,642
So, please, please, please...

330
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,810
Please, motherfucking please...

331
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:34,274
just stop trying to tell me
that this motherfucker is beautiful.

332
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,567
I'm sorry!

333
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:42,032
I'm sorry, okay? Look, Bruce Jenner
was a good-looking white man.

334
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:45,285
Right? But as a white woman? Shit...

335
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,749
I ain't seen a white chick that ugly
since me and Shawn in the fucking movie.

336
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,130
"You were thinking it!"

337
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,549
"You said it!"

338
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:08,684
Such a crazy time, man.
Such a crazy time in this world.

339
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,062
Fucking racism is coming back
like cocaine and skinny jeans.

340
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,272
Look at this shit here.

341
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,858
It's crazy, but you know what?

342
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,902
I don't think it's coming back everywhere.

343
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,988
I'm not going to let it come back
with me and my friends.

344
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,448
And I know a good number of people
in here ain't going to let it come back

345
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,702
with them and their friends.
We came too fucking far to allow racism

346
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,621
to break us up now.
So, we're having real conversations

347
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,747
about real issues, right?

348
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,082
For example,

349
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,502
my white friends want to say the n-word.

350
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,754
Yeah. And I'm like...

351
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,548
"Nigga, no."

352
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,721
And they're confused,
or <i>perplexed</i> as they call it.

353
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,640
"Why can't I say it? You say it."

354
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,019
I'm like, "Yeah. Well, I'm a nigga.
I can do that type of shit."

355
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,688
"Well, it's in all the rap songs."

356
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,898
"Yeah, guess what? Them niggas, too.

357
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,984
They can say that type of shit."

358
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,278
"Well, but why can't I say it?"

359
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,571
I said, "Look, nigga..."

360
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:09,911
I said, "Nigger" was a word that was used
to hurt black people's feelings,

361
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,957
to demean us and make us feel less
than everybody.

362
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:18,170
But see, brothers,
we took that word and we transposed it.

363
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,379
We remixed it.

364
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,341
And we took our pain and we turned
that shit into positivity.

365
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:26,386
And we took the word "nigger"
and turned it into a term of endearment.

366
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,640
It went from, "Nigger," to, "Nigga!"

367
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:36,104
And that's a beautiful thing
that black people in our culture do.

368
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,106
It's a powerful thing that we do.

369
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,900
We did the same thing with chains.

370
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:43,570
Chains. They was meant to enslave us,
keep us captured.

371
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,197
Keep us as slaves.

372
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,616
But now that shit is status quo.

373
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,952
What's the first thing black people do
when we get some fucking money?

374
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,497
Buy some motherfucking chains.

375
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,208
Brothers be like,
"Look at all these chains on my neck!

376
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,296
I'm getting my feet shackles bling
next week.<i>"</i>

377
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,759
Look at what black folks did with a pig.

378
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,470
A pig. A filthy, dirty animal,

379
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,180
they gave us during slavery to eat.

380
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,849
Like, "You wanna eat some meat?
Well, eat this, niggers!"

381
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,935
And black people was like, "Well, okay."

382
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,688
And look at what...We tore a pig up.

383
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:22,109
We ate every fucking part of the pig.

384
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,406
If black people could eat a pig's soul,
we'd deep fry that shit.

385
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,493
To this day,
when a pig see a black person,

386
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,537
that motherfucker run off scared, like...

387
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,538
"Nigga, hide me.

388
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,582
No. The black folks is coming.

389
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,337
No. Hide me.
Please, let the white folks get me

390
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,005
'cause all they make is bacon.

391
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,758
These motherfuckers,
they eat every fucking part of me.

392
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,138
Look at my feet.
They took my fucking feet.

393
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,350
They chopped them off.

394
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,353
And they put 'em
in these fucking see-through jars.

395
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,731
And they eat the shit cold.

396
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:05,110
And they hands get sticky
and start looking like pig feet.

397
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,529
Look at what...

398
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,533
Look at what they did with my intestines.
They took my fucking intestines out!

399
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,202
And they clean the shit out.

400
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,998
All...The whole family.
The momma, the kids, the uncle,

401
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,084
they clean the shit out with vinegar.

402
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:26,089
They boiled it, put some Larry's on it,
and called the shit, chitlins.

403
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,886
It stunk up the whole house
and they still ate it.

404
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,014
The niggas ate my ass!

405
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:36,766
Literally!

406
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,936
Look at...Man, look at my neck.

407
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,980
Look at my motherfucking neck.

408
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:43,899
Why's it like this?

409
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,693
'Cause the nigga took my neck bone,

410
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,529
boiled it and put it
in some fucking collard greens!"

411
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:57,329
That's beauty of black people,
the beauty of our culture,

412
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,747
that's how we do.

413
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:02,501
We take our pain
and we turn it into positivity.

414
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,669
But you know...And my white friend,
you know, he was like,

415
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,546
"Well, what can I do to say it?"

416
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,881
I was like, "Motherfucker..."

417
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,758
White people so damn persistent.

418
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,261
I see why y'all is successful.
You negotiate everything.

419
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,056
"Oh, well I hear your angle,
but what if...

420
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,353
I know you have a wall up,
but if I dig a tunnel up under here...

421
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,104
How do I get to the n-word?"

422
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:27,734
I'm like, "Look, man, I wish there was
a protocol that I could give you, okay?

423
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,196
I wish there was an application
you could fill out,

424
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,324
and you could send it in
to nigga immigrations."

425
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,328
You go to niggagations
and get your fucking nigga pass.

426
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,413
You know what I mean?
And there's an angry brother sitting

427
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,915
at the desk.
He got to interview you.

428
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,208
He's sitting there like...

429
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,586
"Yeah, what you want?"

430
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,422
"I'm here to get my nigga..."

431
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,341
"You're here to get what, motherfucker?"

432
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,761
"I'm here to get my n-word pass."

433
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,429
"All right. That's better.

434
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,267
All right, well...who sent you?"

435
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,477
"Laq'kieché."

436
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,020
"Spell it."

437
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:13,697
"L...A...Q...apostrophe...

438
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,033
K...I...E...

439
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,119
C...H...

440
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:22,956
E...Accent over the E..."

441
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,542
"And?"

442
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,837
"And the Q is silent."

443
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,591
"My nigga! That was...

444
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,010
That was a hard one, man.

445
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,470
Hey, I want to thank you.
Now I know how to spell my wife

446
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,306
and my daughter's name.
Thank you, brother.

447
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,601
Hey, don't forget your nigga pass.
Here you go. All right, next.

448
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:46,187
All right. On <i>The Cosby Show</i>
when Denise made Theo

449
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,981
that designer knock-off shirt...

450
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:53,945
What was the name of the real designer
that she knocked off?

451
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,949
Goldie Gotrell! My nigga!

452
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,035
Thumb imprint, nigga. Get your nigga pass.

453
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:02,454
All right. Next!

454
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,622
Let's see here...

455
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,915
All right, let's see your application.
All right. Okay.

456
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:11,379
Okay. Your hobbies are eating, drinking,
smoking, and all types of ill shit.

457
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,339
All right.

458
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,382
All right...

459
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,886
What's your favorite flavor of Kool-Aid?"

460
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,180
"It's fruit punch. I love fruit punch."

461
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,976
"I don't know...

462
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,979
Personally, I like grape.
You know? 'Cause...

463
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,190
It does something funny
to a black person's mouth

464
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,942
'cause the sweet and the tangy
makes your mouth do this here...

465
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,445
Okay...

466
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,863
When making Kool-Aid...

467
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:37,822
What...

468
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,325
is your sugar...

469
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,743
to water...

470
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,286
ratio?"

471
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:53,838
"Well, that be three parts sugar,
one part water."

472
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,509
"Motherfucker, what you making, milk?

473
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,679
Denied! Get the fuck up out of here!

474
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,848
What kind of sour pucker shit you making?

475
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,600
Let me tell you something.

476
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,560
It's 18 parts sugar...

477
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,354
dash of water.

478
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,358
If you sip it
and don't get instant diabetes,

479
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,860
well, motherfucker, that ain't Kool-Aid.

480
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,446
You made Gatorade.

481
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,617
And, hey, hey. For your information...

482
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:28,039
every nigga know
the flavor ain't fruit punch.

483
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,374
The flavor is..."

484
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,792
Red!

485
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:31,918
Red!

486
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,259
So, finally I caved in
and I gave him a nigga pass.

487
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,636
I gave him a nigga pass
'cause I knew him my whole life,

488
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,555
and I knew if we had beef
with other brothers,

489
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,557
he was going to have my back.
And I love him like a brother,

490
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,809
so, I was like, "Listen,
you keep this shit between me and you."

491
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,437
See, because a nigga pass is regional.

492
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,190
You do not get a universal nigga pass.

493
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:58,361
You gotta get your nigga passport stamped.
Every fucking new black person you meet,

494
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,363
they gotta stamp it with approval.

495
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,656
Because here's the thing.

496
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,576
There's only one white boy
that got a universal nigga pass.

497
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,745
And that is Eminem. You know why?

498
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:12,709
'Cause Dr. Dre endorsed him.
His baby mama drama is real...

499
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,338
and that freestyle he did
about Donald Trump was amazing.

500
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:26,222
So, what I'm saying is,
you can say "nigga" around <i>yo </i>niggas,

501
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,893
but if you think you gonna go
around some new niggas...

502
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,270
and say "nigga"?

503
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,690
"Nigga!"

504
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,695
Now's the time
you don't want to be a nigga.

505
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,031
It's a tough time, man,
being black in America.

506
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,991
Cops are shooting niggas
like they playing a game

507
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:47,285
of Pokemon GO up in this motherfucker.

508
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,038
I'm like, "Wait, are y'all getting points
for that shit?"

509
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:53,374
But see, for black folks, man,
it's scary being black.

510
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,419
When the cops are in back of me...
Something happens to you

511
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,046
when you are a black person.

512
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,174
You immediately...When the cops...
The lights don't gotta be on,

513
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,467
they just in back of you.

514
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,677
You immediately freeze.
And you start looking

515
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,554
in the rearview mirror,
hoping they don't see you seeing them

516
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,847
in the rearview mirror.

517
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,558
And then you change the position
of how you seat.

518
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,102
'Cause, you know, black folks,
we drive back here.

519
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,439
Them cops come in back of you,
you sit up real white

520
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:17,899
up in that motherfucker.

521
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,486
If, for a split second,
you be in your car, like,

522
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,239
"Wait, did I steal this shit?"

523
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,952
Something has to change.

524
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,746
And I think they need a new check
and balance system.

525
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:37,001
You can't partner a potentially racist cop
with another potentially racist cop.

526
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,546
No. We need check and balance.

527
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,048
So, for every potentially racist cop,

528
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:47,887
we'll partner him
with a strong, black, female officer.

529
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:55,311
Yes, because sisters are firm,
but they are fair.

530
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,146
And they ain't gonna
let no injustice happen.

531
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,775
That white cop get out of hand?
Oh, sister going to check his ass.

532
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,903
And she going to check the crook, too,
if he get out of hand. You know?

533
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,405
White cop like,
"Get the fuck out the car!

534
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,447
Get the fuck out the car!"

535
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,991
"Hold the fuck up!

536
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,830
You ain't got to talk to him that way.

537
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,166
You ain't got to talk to him that way.

538
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,544
He is a human bein'."

539
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,504
"I think you meant 'being.'"

540
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:25,300
"Motherfucker, I said, 'being.'
The G is silent.

541
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,346
So goddamn sick.

542
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,348
Come on, baby,
get your ass up out the car.

543
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,851
You see, he turned all red in the face,
that means he's upset.

544
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,269
Come on, get up out the car."

545
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,854
"Put your fucking hands up!

546
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,731
Put your fucking hands
where I can see 'em!"

547
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:40,690
"See, hold up.

548
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,693
I 'pecifically told you...

549
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:50,700
I 'pecifically told you,
don't speak to that boy like that."

550
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,077
"I think you meant 'specifically.'"

551
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,662
"Motherfucker, I said...

552
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,289
'Pecifically.

553
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,625
The S is silent.

554
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,129
Now come on, baby,
get your ass up out the car.

555
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,840
Put your hands in the air,
but don't wave 'em

556
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,425
like you just don't care."

557
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,511
"Oh, my God, look at...He has a gun.
Look at that thing in his pants!

558
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,889
I think he has a fucking gun!
It's a 12 gauge! It's huge!"

559
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,934
"Motherfucker, don't shoot!
That's not a gun.

560
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,478
It's his dick, motherfucker.

561
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,148
Yeah, move. I got this.

562
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,526
Baby, what's your fucking problem?
You know why we pulled your ass over?

563
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,695
Look at you. You got fucking saggy jeans.

564
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,156
You got tattoos on your face,
gold teeth in your mouth.

565
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:33,076
Where the fuck do you think you going?
You ain't going to work, motherfucker.

566
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,619
That's for goddamn sure.

567
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,580
And what's that weed smell?
Gimme that shit!

568
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,750
Oh, that's that raspberry yum-yum.
We going to have to keep this.

569
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,587
Confiscate this for evidence.
Okay, everything's good here."

570
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,339
"No. I want to ask him some..."

571
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,091
"Motherfucker, don't axe him shit.

572
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,592
I'll axe the questions."

573
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:54,722
"Oh, my God, Lacricia,
it's not 'axe,' it's 'ask.'"

574
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,769
"Motherfucker, I said axe.
The S is silent.

575
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,689
Now get your ass up in the car.

576
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:05,191
And my name ain't Lacricia,
it's Laq'kieché.

577
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,818
The Q is silent.

578
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,738
Now, come on. Let's go get some breakfax."

579
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,578
It's just a crazy time, man.

580
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,998
Now, you see,
I'm passionate about this shit,

581
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:21,749
'cause I'm a father.

582
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,086
I have two beautiful, teenage kids.

583
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,213
Beautiful, black children.

584
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,008
You see, I get concerned
when they leave my house that...

585
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,676
they may not come home

586
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,804
because of the shit that's popping off,
and I just can't have that.

587
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:35,888
I just can't.

588
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,891
And see, I don't care if you're black,
I don't care if you're white,

589
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,685
I don't care if you're Middle Eastern.

590
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:43,271
I don't care if you're Asian,
I don't care if you're a little person,

591
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:45,857
'cause little people got babies, too.
They just real little.

592
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,737
No parent should be strapped
with the anxiety of,

593
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,281
"Is my child going to be safe?"

594
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,786
But see, they tell us as...
They tell us, as black folks

595
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,997
that we need to have "the talk"

596
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,914
with our children.

597
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:02,832
You hear about this?

598
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:03,875
"The talk."

599
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,711
It's when you sit your children down
and you explain to them

600
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,504
how to respond respectfully

601
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,465
when law enforcement pulls them over.

602
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,300
And see, I'm down for that.

603
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,635
And I think that's the responsible thing
to do as a parent.

604
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,846
You sit your children down,
you tell them to be respectful

605
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,389
to our law enforcement.

606
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,851
So, see, I tried
to have "the talk" with my kids...

607
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,311
And you know...

608
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,480
halfway through the talk

609
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:28,524
I sound like an old, scared slave

610
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,111
that didn't know he had his freedom.

611
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,114
I was talking to my kids, I was like,
"Baby, if the cops pull you over,

612
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,825
you hush your mouth,
and now don't you sass me, boy!

613
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,037
Don't you sass me now, boy!

614
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,956
The cops pull you over,
I want you to hold your head down

615
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,874
in humility.

616
00:34:44,957 --> 00:34:47,627
And you just rock back and forth, he goes,
'You know why I pulled you over?'

617
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,214
I want you to smile!
Show all 36 of your teeth.

618
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:56,177
He goes, 'You know why I pulled you over?'
Go, 'No, suh, but I sure do trust ya!'

619
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,015
And he goes, 'You wise-mouthing me?'
Go, 'No, suh, I'd never do such a thing,

620
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:01,933
Mr. Bossman.'

621
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,977
Yeah, so you use all kinda surnames.
See, the white ego love that.

622
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,606
'No, suh, Mr. Bossman, master-man, suh,
I'd never do such a thing.'

623
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,858
Then he goes,
'You want me to read you your rights?'

624
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,820
You best to stay humble.
You say, 'Yes, suh, please do.

625
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,572
Well, you know I can't read.'"

626
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,163
I get upset. You know why I get upset?
Because I get jealous.

627
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,749
I get jealous because I got white friends

628
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,043
and I've been pulled over
with my white friends

629
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,672
and what I've found
is that white people are not afraid

630
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,798
of the police.

631
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,508
Black people are.

632
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,135
'Cause when we got pulled over,

633
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,304
my white friend
cursed the fucking police out.

634
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,059
He cursed the police out so bad,
I thought he pulled the cop over.

635
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,980
I swear to God,
he was going to write the cop a ticket.

636
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,482
I was hiding in the glovebox, like,
"Nigga, he gonna get shot

637
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,775
sooner or later."

638
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:58,322
Because here's the talk
that white people have with their kids.

639
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,951
"If the cops pull you over,
I want you to say, 'Hey, bucko!

640
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,789
You better have a goddamn,
good reason why.'

641
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,458
Yeah, if he starts
to mouth off to you, say,

642
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,587
'Hey, hey! Hey, buddy.
You watch your freaking mouth.

643
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,215
You watch your freaking mouth.
I pay my taxes.

644
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:19,594
Yeah, so that means you work for me.'

645
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:22,305
Yeah, if he keeps it up and he reaches
for his pepper spray, you're like,

646
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,098
'I fucking dare ya. I fucking dare ya.

647
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,225
I double dog dare ya.

648
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,854
Go ahead. Spray me right
in my blue eye and make it red.

649
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,483
Yeah, 'cause I'll have my lawyer
so far up your asshole,

650
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,944
you'll need a goddamn gerbil
to get him out.'

651
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:43,201
Then, he says one more smart thing,
one more smart thing,

652
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,037
I want you to grab his pen and go,
'That's it!

653
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,290
I'm going to write a letter.

654
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,253
'Dear Mr. President Trump...'"

655
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,381
Fucking Trump.

656
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,092
What an interesting year it has been,
huh, people?

657
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,513
"Dear white folks and Trump supporters,
please fasten your seat belt,

658
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:07,850
it's going to get a little turbulent
in here for about 5 minutes.

659
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,562
So, strap it in and enjoy the ride.
We'll be out of here in no time."

660
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,521
Okay, Trump.

661
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,732
This is the craziest shit I've ever seen.

662
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,650
I...It's...

663
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,194
Maybe it's his reality show background.

664
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,278
But...

665
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,990
he's turned the White House
into a reality show.

666
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,703
I swear, I find myself watching politics
the way women watch reality shows.

667
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:30,122
I'm like, "Girl, did you see
what happened today?"

668
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,290
"No, what?"

669
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,334
"Girl, sit down.

670
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,797
Your boy Trump is tripping again."

671
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:38,923
"What happened?"

672
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,676
"Well, first of all,
he fired Sean Spicer."

673
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,761
"He fired Sean Spicer? Why?"

674
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,971
"I don't know.

675
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,269
But he hired this cockeyed bitch,
Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

676
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,436
Let me tell you something,

677
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,356
that cockeyed bitch
don't be answering nobody questions.

678
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:59,318
Ooh, that cockeyed heifer got attitude.
She be like, 'What the fuck do you want?

679
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,903
Hurry the fuck up.

680
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,030
I got an eye doctor appointment.

681
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,824
I ain't got time for this shit.

682
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,244
You want a straight answer?
Give me a straight eye, motherfucker.'

683
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:14,041
Girl, do you know the plot is thickening?
You see what's happening over in Russia?"

684
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,334
"I know."

685
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:16,502
"Girl, you know what that is?

686
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:20,673
I think Putin got pictures of Trump
doing some sexy shit

687
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,717
with some Russian prostitutes."

688
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,010
"Girl, why do you say that?"

689
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,053
"Girl, watch the First Lady.

690
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,598
Every time Trump try to grab Melania hand,

691
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,891
what does she be doing?

692
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,602
She be like, 'Get the fuck up...
Get the fuck up off me!

693
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,438
Get the fuck up off me!

694
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,691
You pussy-grabby motherfucker,
get the fuck up off me!

695
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,614
Go sleep your ass in the Oval Office.

696
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,992
You ain't getting no
First Lady Koochie tonight.'

697
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,120
"Girl, do you know he fired Comey?"

698
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,581
"The FBI director? Why?"

699
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,166
"I don't know.

700
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,253
But they said some shit about collusion.

701
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,256
Now, see, I don't know
what the fuck that mean...

702
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,303
but it sounds shady as fuck to me."

703
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,932
This is a historical time
in the history of our country,

704
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,184
a historical time.

705
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,645
'Cause this is the first time
I ever seen white people...

706
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:19,648
embarrassed by another white person.

707
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,692
This shit is crazy!

708
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:26,822
'Cause the beauty of white people
is white people love white people.

709
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,367
And they support each other,
no matter how talented

710
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,952
or untalented they are,
they have each other's back.

711
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,955
How the fuck you think Vanilla Ice
went multi-platinum?

712
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,918
But with Trump,
every time he says some stupid shit,

713
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,252
some embarrassing shit,

714
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,005
I see white people put their head
in their hand embarrassed,

715
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,840
like, "Jesus Christ...

716
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,135
This nigga! Gosh!

717
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,848
God, I wish I was black today.

718
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:56,727
I'll take the police beatings.
I'll take the debt.

719
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,063
I'll take the half hour late
for everything.

720
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:02,525
I'll even take the ashy shit
that formulates right here.

721
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,697
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but when it gets 55 degrees and lower,

722
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,950
they all get real ashy right here.

723
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,245
It looks like Spider-Man hit 'em
with a little web, like...

724
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,749
Just somebody shut him the fuck up."

725
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:23,671
Every race has somebody
that we're embarrassed by, okay?

726
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,715
Every race.
That's what makes us all the same.

727
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,593
Every race got somebody
that we are embarrassed by.

728
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:34,640
So, yes, Donald Trump is embarrassing
to white people, okay?

729
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,475
So, Donald Trump...

730
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,978
is the Flavor Flav...

731
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,568
of white people.

732
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,864
But I look at all that's going on today,
and you know what I say?

733
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,907
I say, "I am happy for Barack."

734
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,952
I am so happy for Barack, man.
That he's so...

735
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,495
I'm so happy he's out of office.

736
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,706
He look happy. He looks so happy.

737
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,462
Because the presidency is stressful.

738
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,214
Remember when he first came into office?
He looked all young.

739
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,050
Looked good in a suit, right?
Had that black hair,

740
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:11,427
golden brown skin.

741
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,596
He looked like Denzel Washington.

742
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:18,142
8 years of fighting with Republicans,
he got all old and gray.

743
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,311
Fucking moles on his face.

744
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,647
By the end, that nigga looked
like Morgan Freeman.

745
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:36,952
By the end, Barack looked like he was,
so tired of taking the Republican shit.

746
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,205
Right? He was like,
"Fuck this bipartisan shit."

747
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,332
He looked like he just wanted
to curse motherfuckers out.

748
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,417
His last speech,
he looked like he just wanted to go,

749
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:49,089
"Fuck you. Suck my dick.
Lick ass, America. Barack is out, bitch!

750
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,475
You can take your flag
and shove it up your goddamn ass.

751
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,894
That's right. I set up my retirement.

752
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:04,980
I'm moving to Seattle,
where I legalized weed.

753
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,651
And guess what?
I'm going to smoke my lips black again.

754
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:09,818
That's what I'm going to do.

755
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,240
I'm dropping an album
with Jay-Z and Beyonce.

756
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,743
It's called <i>Head Niggas in Charge</i>.

757
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,164
I got my own clothing line, Barackawear.

758
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,418
You can get it at Macy's,
right next to Sean John and Rocawear.

759
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:30,297
Be sure to pick up my new cologne,
Potus Number 44.

760
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,009
Not to be confused with Number 45.

761
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,928
That shit stinks.

762
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:44,895
I just signed a lucrative deal
with Ciroc Liquor and Sean Diddy Combs.

763
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,897
That's right, I'm a Ciroc boy.

764
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:51,068
So, come drink Ciroc
with your boy Barack."

765
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,203
You know, I was sitting there
watching Barack.

766
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,913
Man, that shit is stressful, man.

767
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,499
That shit was stressful.
I mean, they fucking heckled him.

768
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,042
They heckled the president.

769
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,419
You ain't got to like him,

770
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,920
but shit,
you should respect him,

771
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,130
he's the president.

772
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,842
And the man was giving a speech
about healthcare,

773
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,510
which is important to him.

774
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,637
Because he knew,
once his black ass was out of office,

775
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,514
he probably wasn't gonna have none.

776
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,808
And he was giving an impassioned speech,

777
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,893
"We need healthcare for every American,

778
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,895
and we should be fastidious
with that healthcare."

779
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:29,440
And a Republican screamed out, "You lie!"

780
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,151
In the middle of his speech.

781
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:36,614
See, now, I know Barack Obama's
our first black president, right?

782
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,282
But if that was me...

783
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,118
and the motherfucker screamed out
in the middle of my speech.

784
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:46,707
See, that's when the world's going
to see the first nigga president.

785
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,002
I'd lose my fucking mind.
I'd be like, "We need healthcare

786
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,920
for every American
and we should be fastidious with that..."

787
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:52,838
"You lie!"

788
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,593
"Who the fuck said that shit?

789
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,682
Who the fuck said that shit?

790
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,686
Hey, yo, Biden! Nigga, Biden, we got beef!

791
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:17,029
Hillary, get the fuck off me.
Hillary, get the fuck up off of me!

792
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,865
Nah, I ain't Bill. I don't play that shit.

793
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,618
Yo, Michelle. Handle that bitch.

794
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,163
I'm from Hawaii, motherfucker!

795
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,667
What? I got nukes motherfucker!

796
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,254
Do we have a problem?

797
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,006
I said...

798
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:40,052
Do...we...have...a...problem?

799
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,057
See, I want to take this time
to explain to white people...

800
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,435
what Barack Obama meant to black people.

801
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,647
See, we didn't like Barack
because he was black.

802
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,774
Okay, maybe we did,
but that's not the point.

803
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,819
It was part of it, okay, but...

804
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:01,407
We liked Barack because he was good
and he represented something for us.

805
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,992
He symbolized something for black people.

806
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,495
See, Barack Obama winning the presidency,

807
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,871
symbolized...

808
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,623
for black people...

809
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:14,878
the first time in the history
of us being in this country...

810
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,172
that we felt like we won.

811
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:21,385
After all we've been through.
Segregation, civil rights, slavery.

812
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,931
And Barack Obama winning the presidency,

813
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:29,309
was the first time we,
as black people,

814
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,353
felt like we won.

815
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,358
See, that and the OJ trial.
But see, we...

816
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,276
we...

817
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:40,863
we knew that nigga did it!
Oh, we knew that nigga did it!

818
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,699
Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

819
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,286
He killed them poor white people.
I'm so fucking sorry!

820
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,871
He ain't shit!

821
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,749
He ain't shit. That motherfucker!

822
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,835
He killed them poor white...
He killed that little boy, too!

823
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,044
He killed his ass!

824
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,963
All that little boy wanted was some pussy!

825
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,047
That's all.

826
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,225
We just wanted to win.

827
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,353
We just wanted to win.

828
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:18,984
And when Barack won,
I cried, my kids cried, my momma cried.

829
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:22,112
Every black person cried
because you know what?

830
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,574
We felt like a bunch of slaves
on a plantation

831
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:28,118
that watched one brother get his freedom.

832
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,954
We was like, "You better run, Barack!

833
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,167
You better run!"

834
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:40,297
<i>♪ Whoa, my lord, lord, lord, lord ♪</i>

835
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,770
I need some water.

836
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,690
Before I overheat like Wendy Williams.

837
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,873
It looked like God was fucking with her.

838
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,125
Like,
"All them people you talk shit about.

839
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,754
I'm fucking with you now.
Sit yo' ass..."

840
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,682
You know what's crazy, man?

841
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,017
Is, if I had one wish.

842
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,812
I wish that we can erase hate.

843
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,857
Because hate...hate...

844
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,817
It's killing us as people.

845
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:47,656
How do you erase hate, man?
Because hate creates racism.

846
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,908
Hate creates fear.

847
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,451
It creates prejudice.

848
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:55,497
And now it's going from racism
and it's transforming.

849
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,249
And now we have gaycism.

850
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,961
We have people hating on people
because of their sexuality.

851
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,673
Come on, people. How small-hearted are we?
What the fuck is going on?

852
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:08,886
I don't think you judge a man
for his race, his creed, his color,

853
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,346
their religion,
their political background,

854
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,348
their financial status,

855
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,766
their sexuality,

856
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,728
the diameter of their asshole,
who gives a fuck?

857
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,107
Here's my take on gay people.

858
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,442
Let's keep it real.

859
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,110
Do you!

860
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,946
Do you!

861
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,116
Just don't do me!

862
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,874
You know what I think gay people need,
that really want they equality?

863
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,459
That really want they civil rights?

864
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,378
I think they need
a gay civil rights leader.

865
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,048
Yeah. They need,
like, a Martin Luther King...

866
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,216
but a gay one.

867
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,804
They need Martin Luther Queen.

868
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:58,685
You know, Martin Luther Queen come out.
He's a dignified brother, right?

869
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,395
He got on a suit and tie.

870
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,649
But he got this shit turned up right here,
like, "Hi...

871
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,234
Hi..."

872
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,157
He got his own personalized microphone.
It got little balls on it.

873
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,914
And he comes out and he does his version
of the famous "I had a dream" speech,

874
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:19,831
but the gay version.

875
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:20,916
He's like...

876
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:32,844
"I...

877
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,555
had a dream...

878
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,974
girl.

879
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,978
I had a dream...

880
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,063
that one day, one day...

881
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,148
black boys...Hey...

882
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,445
Little white boys...

883
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,824
I help you with the swirl. Hey...

884
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,868
Little Hispanic boys...

885
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,204
Or as I like to call you, <i>papitos</i>.

886
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,207
Hey...

887
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,710
Hey, <i>papitos</i>.

888
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,843
I had a dream...

889
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:16,847
that we could all sit
at a table as a group of brethren.

890
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,934
Just brethren. No fish allowed. Pew.

891
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,937
Pew.

892
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:31,445
I had a dream that we can have
the same marital rights as straights do.

893
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:34,781
Yes, that gays can get married. Hey...

894
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,242
Gays can get divorced. Ya...

895
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:40,454
And we can take half
of somebody else's shit

896
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,664
that don't deserve it. Hey...

897
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,751
Yas...

898
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,757
I had a dream...

899
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,970
that we could fight side by side
in the military...

900
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,306
with our brothers

901
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,767
in the foxholes...

902
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:05,187
Way deep...

903
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,357
in them little foxholes.

904
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:14,654
We all nuzzled together
inside those little foxholes...

905
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,952
'Scuse me.
This dream just got a little bit wet.

906
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,879
I had a dream...

907
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:36,134
I had a dream that we could change
our small-minded military slogan

908
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,345
from 'don't ask, don't tell,'

909
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:41,264
but to,  'who cares,
mind your fucking business.'

910
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,353
So, let us all join hands,
you let us all join hands,

911
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,813
and you let freedom ring.

912
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,358
You let freedom ring through the chilly,
gay streets of San Francisco.

913
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,151
You let freedom ring

914
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,821
through the dirty streets
of New York City,

915
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:58,740
filled with all them cute,
little Hispanic boys.

916
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:04,329
I see you, Jose and Juan,
and I raise you a Julio.

917
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:09,626
You let freedom ring,
you let freedom ring

918
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,921
through the segregated bathrooms
of North Carolina.

919
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:16,216
Who cares if you're transgender
or if you're a female,

920
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,594
as long as you don't piss all
over the toilet seats.

921
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,848
And you wipe front to back.

922
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,435
Or is it back to front?

923
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:29,896
- Front to back?
- Yeah.

924
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,399
Front to back, yes.
The other way is a little bit messy.

925
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:38,071
You let freedom ring, you let freedom ring

926
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:41,867
through the dark closets
of Hollywood, California.

927
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,453
Those dark closets,
hiding all the scared, little boys

928
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,498
who's afraid to come out,
afraid to be bullied,

929
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,252
afraid to be judged,
afraid not to be accepted...

930
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,006
afraid to be touched by Kevin Spacey.

931
00:52:58,592 --> 00:52:59,593
Too soon?

932
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,889
That's what the little boy said.

933
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,563
And you let us all join hands
and let us all sing the old, gay anthem.

934
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,858
Free that ass, free that ass,

935
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:18,486
thank God all mighty,
we done freed that ass."

936
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:27,329
See, this shit that I'm preaching,
I'm not just preaching,

937
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,455
I'm living.

938
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:30,457
And I'm trying to grow
and I'm trying to evolve.

939
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,710
And I'm trying and that shit is hard
for people to digest.

940
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,004
Hard for any human being to digest.

941
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,550
But when it comes home to your house,
that's when shit changes, man.

942
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,635
See, me...

943
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:43,637
I'mma tell y'all a real story, okay?

944
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,679
Real story.

945
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,807
My daughter came to me at 15 years old.

946
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:48,975
She's 17 now.

947
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,145
Wonderful girl. She comes to me,
she goes, "Dad...

948
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,898
I kissed a girl...

949
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:56,900
and I think I liked it."

950
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,278
And I said, "Oh, shit, bitch.
That...What the..."

951
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,157
No, 'cause
that's my little nickname for her.

952
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,867
She little bitch. I'm a big bitch.

953
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,620
I got the little t-shirts,
"Big bitch, little bitch."

954
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,957
But you know,
when she first hit me with the news,

955
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,541
I was like, "That's how you gonna
break the news to me?

956
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:15,210
You gonna tell me in the form of a song?

957
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:17,337
<i>♪ I kissed a girl</i>
<i>And I think I liked it? ♪</i>

958
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,797
Is that the new shit kids are doing?

959
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,090
"Hey, Dad, I'm fucking up at school."

960
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,007
"What happened?"

961
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,218
<i>♪ I fucked up the commas</i>
<i>I fucked up the commas, yeah ♪</i>

962
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:27,138
So I said, you know, I said,
"Okay, baby girl."

963
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,934
I said, "Well, you know,
this is your first sexual experience.

964
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:31,893
Right?

965
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:33,979
Hey, nigga, right?"

966
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,732
She said, "Umm...yeah.
It's my first sexual...

967
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,695
I said, "Man, that sounds shady
as fuck to me."

968
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,865
I said, "Listen, baby girl."
I said, "You're 15 years old.

969
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:50,578
You are entitled to experience things
and find your way.

970
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,747
You know, you're a young kid and,
you know, who knows,

971
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,457
when you go to college,
you know, you may feel differently."

972
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:56,501
And she stopped me. She said, "Dad...

973
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,004
but what if I'm gay?"

974
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:01,923
And I said...

975
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,844
"Well, baby girl," I said...

976
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:08,930
"If you are gay,

977
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:12,183
and this is the life that you chose,

978
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:15,270
or better yet, the life that chose you.

979
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:19,274
Understand, you got
a tough road ahead of you.

980
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,860
See, the world...

981
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,195
may judge you.

982
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,406
Some people will...

983
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,491
outcast you.

984
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,910
Some people gonna look at you funny.

985
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,621
Others will never accept you.

986
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:37,000
You are a quadruple minority.

987
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:41,046
You are a female, gay, black Wayans.

988
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,550
That's a tough, fucking life."

989
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,135
But I said,

990
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,929
"That's out there.
They're going to judge you.

991
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:53,767
But, baby girl,
when you walk into this home."

992
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,144
I said, "You're gonna get nothing
but love,

993
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:57,771
respect,

994
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:01,024
and unconditional embraces
from me 'cause I love you."

995
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:09,199
But you got to try a dick, right?

996
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,494
You got to...

997
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,829
You got to try a dick, right?

998
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,124
Just a, you know, one dick.
Like, you know, just accidentally,

999
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,042
like fall...

1000
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,253
Or just let a dick hit you in the head.

1001
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:26,257
Look, girl, you got to try the dick,
you know?

1002
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:29,260
Like, not right now
'cause you're only 15 years old,

1003
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,805
but when you get,
like 17, 18...Prom night.

1004
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,181
Try a dick!

1005
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,977
And don't try a 17-year-old dick
'cause that's going to be quick and bad

1006
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,188
and you may be like,
"Fuck him. Bitches for life."

1007
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,734
Go get you a nice, seasoned dick.

1008
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:48,363
You know? Go get you a nice,
22-year-old grad school dick.

1009
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,323
You know what I mean?
Somebody that had a couple

1010
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,950
of ill-advised pregnancies,

1011
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,535
so his pull out game is good.

1012
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,537
Keeps some Plan B in his pocket.

1013
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,997
You know? Probably had a couple
of diseases already.

1014
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,332
You know, it was cleared up,

1015
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,126
but he's still got the bottle
of penicillin

1016
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,711
'cause who ever finishes
all the penicillin, right?

1017
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:06,923
But you got to try a dick,
and don't get no little,

1018
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,884
stabby dick that feel
like a number two pencil you fucking.

1019
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:11,761
And don't get no super, girthy dick

1020
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,431
that look like
a goddamn Loch Ness Monster,

1021
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,391
that be breathing on its own.

1022
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,269
It's so big,
it feels like you're giving labor pains.

1023
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,439
Every time you having sex with it,
it feels like you need an episiotomy

1024
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,899
and an epidural
in order to enjoy the shit.

1025
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:28,570
And don't get no little, weird,
uncircumcised dick. Don't get no...

1026
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:35,368
One of them dick
that look like an anteater

1027
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,203
or a Mr. Snuffleupagus.

1028
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:42,208
And when you pull the skin back,
its all full of lint and cheese.

1029
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,420
And it smell funny.

1030
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:49,340
Like an old gym sock that's been left
in a locker room for two or three days.

1031
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,176
And when you taste it,
it tastes bad,

1032
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,178
like a bad shot of tequila.

1033
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,597
You need some salt and a lime,

1034
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,641
in order to get the fucking,
nasty-ass taste out your mouth.

1035
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,393
You got to try a dick.

1036
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:06,691
And I'mma tell you something,
when my daughter...

1037
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,318
My daughter dated this girl,

1038
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,404
and she wound up getting
a little heartbroken.

1039
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:12,864
And...

1040
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,658
it was hard because, you know,
this was a little white girl, too,

1041
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,827
so she gave me a two for one, right?

1042
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:22,499
But when your child is crying
on your shoulder

1043
00:58:22,582 --> 00:58:25,668
about some real tears,
about shit that's going on in her life.

1044
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:29,464
It's not on me to judge her,
it's on me to love her.

1045
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,468
So, I grabbed my baby, and I hugged her,
and let her know it was going to be okay.

1046
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,970
And she was crying and snotting
on my brand new Gucci shirt,

1047
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,056
I was mad about that,
but I was like fuck it.

1048
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,683
I tried to console her
the best way I knew how.

1049
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,395
You know, through the form of a song.
I said, "Hey, baby girl, you know...

1050
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,941
<i>♪ Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks</i>♪

1051
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,072
But my son, right?

1052
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,783
My son's getting older, man.
And he's so handsome.

1053
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:59,827
You ever look at your kid, like,
"Nigga, look at how beautiful you are.

1054
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,580
Look at my sperm.
Look at how beautiful you are."

1055
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,750
I look at him, I shook my head,
I was like, "Nigga...you 15..."

1056
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,794
I looked at him,
"Listen, man, you gonna get so much pussy

1057
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:09,045
when you get older."

1058
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,757
And I looked over at my daughter, I said,
"Don't worry, baby girl, you, too."

1059
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:18,388
I know he's getting bigger, man,
you know, 'cause he keep coming up to me,

1060
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:22,767
you know, and seeing how tall he is on me.
He be measuring, like, "Hey, Dad, look.

1061
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,977
I'm almost your height."

1062
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,771
I'll be looking at him, like,
"Nigga, I'll fuck you up."

1063
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:30,858
No, no, no. See, 'cause little boys,
they wanna test they daddies.

1064
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:33,444
See, that's the threshold
for a boy into his manhood.

1065
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,488
It's: can I whoop my daddy's ass?

1066
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:36,864
That makes you a man.

1067
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:38,449
See, but I'm prepared for that shit.

1068
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,119
That's why I never sent his ass to karate.

1069
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,789
But see, little boys are going
to test they father.

1070
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:48,042
And as a dad, all you want
to see is your child be great.

1071
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:52,463
That's all you want,
to see your child be their greatest them.

1072
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,758
And so my son, he was playing basketball,
and he's a great basketball player.

1073
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:00,597
Yeah, he's so good.
And he was playing not so good one game.

1074
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,141
And as a sports fan,
I did what I normally do

1075
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,559
to a team that's sucking.

1076
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,893
I heckled his ass.

1077
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,312
"Hey, nigga, you suck!"

1078
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,647
I'm like, "Hey, hey. What you doing?"

1079
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,900
He goes, "Dad, listen,
I can't play great every night."

1080
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,820
I said, "Motherfucker,"

1081
01:00:16,821 --> 01:00:18,406
That's my little nickname for him.

1082
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,783
He little motherfucker,
I'm big motherfucker.

1083
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:23,536
I got t-shirts,
"Big motherfucker, little motherfucker."

1084
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,621
And, so my son...

1085
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,331
I said,
"You can't play great every night?"

1086
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,418
I said, "Boy, if I didn't play great
every night, you wouldn't have food,

1087
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,046
and nutrition in your stomach
to be able to run up

1088
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,548
and down this goddamn basketball court.

1089
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,301
If I didn't play great every night,
you wouldn't have no goddamn,

1090
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,636
good sneakers on your feet

1091
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,803
that make this noise,

1092
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:46,768
so that you can play some damn defense,
of which your ass ain't playing."

1093
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,147
He goes, "But, Dad, come on,
this is basketball. It ain't work."

1094
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,817
I said, "Motherfucker, life is work."

1095
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,737
I said, "I've been working
since I was six years old, man.

1096
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,280
What do you think I'm doing
out here on the road?

1097
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:04,327
I write, I produce, I act, I do movies,
I do TV, I do standup."

1098
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,413
I said, "If I was a slave,
they'd give me a fucking raise.

1099
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,583
So, don't give me that,
'Dad, it's not work.'

1100
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,834
No, work starts now.

1101
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:14,003
You are a young man. Learn to work.

1102
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,673
And let me tell you something, boy.
You got two jobs.

1103
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:18,216
You got two jobs.

1104
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,217
You got...

1105
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,426
school.

1106
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,053
And you got basketball.

1107
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,138
Well, let me tell you something,
motherfucker,

1108
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,890
you fucking up in school.

1109
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,645
So, the least your stupid ass can do
is go out there

1110
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:32,480
and play some goddamn basketball."

1111
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,734
And my son got up all tough, like,

1112
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,652
"I said."

1113
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,407
He looked at me, he walked away,
balled his fists.

1114
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,908
I said, "What, Shawn?"
I said, "What?"

1115
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,660
I said, "What, Shawn?
You wanna curse at me?

1116
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:46,828
He said...

1117
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:49,539
I said, "You wanna curse at me?
I'll tell you what.

1118
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,041
You go out there and you score 40 points.

1119
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,252
You can come back here,
you can look me in my face and go,

1120
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,129
'Hey, Dad, fuck you!'

1121
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,965
I ain't talking about no little,
soft 'fuck you.'

1122
01:01:59,048 --> 01:02:00,717
I want you to look me in my eyes,

1123
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,636
I want that Daffy Duck,
'you're despicable' spit

1124
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,138
all over my face.

1125
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,098
I want your bottom lip
to hit your chest

1126
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:09,726
when you go, 'Hey, Dad, fuck you!'

1127
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,644
He said, "A'ight."

1128
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,562
I said, "Yeah, a'ight."

1129
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,521
He said, "A'ight."

1130
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:14,856
I said, "Yeah, nigga, a'ight."

1131
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:22,113
Do you know that in a matter
of 14 minutes and 58 seconds,

1132
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:25,491
this boy went out there
and scored 38 points?

1133
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,327
I have never seen no shit like this.

1134
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:31,956
He played so good, I was like,
I want a DNA test.

1135
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,751
Steph Curry come get your fucking baby.

1136
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,128
He played amazing.

1137
01:02:37,211 --> 01:02:39,380
And he gets fouled.
He brought his team back

1138
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,215
from a 30 point deficit.

1139
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:42,592
He gets fouled.

1140
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,635
There's two seconds left on the clock.

1141
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:45,928
He goes to the line.

1142
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,764
He has 38 points.

1143
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,478
39.

1144
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:56,272
They're down one.

1145
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:00,610
He looks at me.

1146
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,747
He closes his eyes,
little, cocky motherfucker.

1147
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,834
The perfect precision.

1148
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:37,897
He misses the shot.

1149
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,066
Clock goes off.

1150
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:44,028
They lose by one. I am so happy.

1151
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,992
I'm not happy because he missed the shot.

1152
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,621
I was happy, man, because as a father,

1153
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:56,582
that I seen the greatness in my child.

1154
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,461
That I seen the great
that I knew he could be since birth.

1155
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,463
That we're raising kings and queens,

1156
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,882
and they're better than us.
They love harder, they live harder,

1157
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,676
they're better than us.

1158
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,678
And you know something beautiful y'all?

1159
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:13,266
That my kids have never
been called a nigger in their life.

1160
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:18,479
Except for by me,
but see I got a nigga pass,

1161
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,064
I can do that type of shit.

1162
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,901
And so my son, I was so proud.
I went over to him...

1163
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:25,695
And I just couldn't hold back
my excitement.

1164
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,905
I said, "See, now
that's how you 'posed to shoot.

1165
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,740
I felt like Will Smith in <i>Bad Boys</i>.

1166
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:32,326
I was like,
"That's how you 'posed to shoot!

1167
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,620
That's how you 'posed to shoot!"

1168
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,665
But I said, "Son,
why didn't you score 40?"

1169
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:39,417
He looked at me, said...

1170
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:45,381
"Because I didn't want
to say 'fuck you' to you, Dad."

1171
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,637
I said, "You stupid motherfucker.

1172
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,556
You lost the goddamn game."

1173
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:55,349
I love y'all! Thank y'all so much!
