1
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,525
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,861
Aziz Ansari!

3
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:23,083
Thank you.
Thank you.

4
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,084
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

5
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,588
Philadelphia, wow!
Thank you.

6
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:28,881
Thank you so much!

7
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:31,174
Wow!
Wow!

8
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,885
This is awkward.

9
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,595
I actually have
no material prepared.

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,555
Um...

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,682
I just booked
this venue for this date

12
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,308
and I was like,
Oh, I'll have an act by then.

13
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,519
I...don't, uh...

14
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,729
No, it's gonna be really good.

15
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,564
I have one prepared
which is convenient

16
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:46,732
'cause we're filming
and everything.

17
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:49,902
Uh, so, let's begin.

18
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,654
I, uh, turned 30 years old
this year.

19
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,199
Yes, it's been a good year.

20
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,160
I have found this year
to be the year

21
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,746
where a lot of my friends
are getting serious

22
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,998
about their lives.
You know, they call me up.

23
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:06,293
They say serious things.
They're like, "Aziz,

24
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,631
you're not gonna believe it!
I just had a baby!"

25
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,633
And I always have
the same reaction.
I always go,

26
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:16,386
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
That sucks!

27
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,973
"I'm so sorry that happened.

28
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:22,476
"Why weren't you guys not using
condoms or birth control?

29
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:25,562
"You're gonna have to take
care of that thing forever!

30
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,815
"All right, well,
I'll talk to you later.

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,775
"I'm going to go do literally
anything I want,

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,819
"'cause I don't have a baby

33
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,695
"so all my options

34
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:38,158
are still options."

35
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,787
I hate those phone calls.
I also hate those emails.

36
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,622
Your friends
send in those emails.

37
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,290
They'll attach
a photo of the baby.

38
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,292
They'll write something cute
to welcome the baby.

39
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,670
"Hey, everyone!

40
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:54,299
Welcome Lindsay
to the Universe!"

41
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:59,387
I always just write back,
"Unsubscribe."

42
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:03,600
Yes, I don't recall
signing up
for this mailing list.

43
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,979
Please remove me
from all future updates.

44
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,647
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to throw your baby

45
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:13,902
in my trash.

46
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:16,404
And now everyone
has video cameras on their
phones and everything

47
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,157
so you can get
videos of the babies.

48
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,408
Every single video I've gotten
is exactly the same though.

49
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:24,329
Kid shows up on the screen.

50
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,748
End of clip.
That's the amazing footage

51
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:28,083
they needed to share
with everyone.

52
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:31,586
"Brian's first steps!"

53
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,799
Look, I walk all the time.
I'm not impressed.

54
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,300
I'm gonna start sending
my own clips back.

55
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,554
"Look at this shit.

56
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,016
"Brian has nothin' on this!
He has no swagger in his step.

57
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,601
He almost fell down
after three steps."

58
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,020
Meanwhile,
I'm running advanced shit.

59
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,147
I can high-step.
I can run if I want to.

60
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,607
I can even tip-toe behind Brian,
push him on the ground

61
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,317
and then step on him
with my next step.

62
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:59,364
So, that's how advanced
my shit is.

63
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,158
Some of these people aren't
ready to have kids, either.

64
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,910
You know, you ever
have friends like that?

65
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,453
They're about to have kids.
You're like, "What?! No!

66
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,582
They're dumb. Why?

67
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,418
I got a friend.
He got married recently.
He's kind of a goofball.

68
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,503
I asked him,
I said, "Hey, you're not gonna
have kids, are you?"

69
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,964
He's like, "Maybe next year."
I was like, "Dude,

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,633
"you still have a chain wallet.

71
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,595
"You can't have a chain wallet
and a kid at the same time.

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,514
"Ah, if your wallet
is causing you so much problem

73
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,017
"you have to chain it
to your person...

74
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,310
"you're not ready to bring
life into the world.

75
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,772
"If you go to like,
pay for the baby
with a chain wallet,

76
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,982
"they should like,
Oh, no, no, no.

77
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:38,612
we got to put this one back--
Whoop!"

78
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,198
I'm not ready for that
kind of responsibility.

79
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,407
If someone came up to me
with a baby like,

80
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,243
"Hey, you got to look out
for this baby."

81
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,620
I be like, "Sorry,
I got my own things
going on right now.

82
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,123
I don't have time to look out
for this little, brown baby."

83
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,251
In this scenario, I'm assuming
it's a little Indian baby.

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,585
If it was a white baby
I'd be like,

85
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,046
Get that thing
away from me.
It's disgusting!"

86
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,091
White babies are gross, man!
I'm sorry!

87
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,426
They're like regular babies
that aren't ripe yet.

88
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,058
And look,
I'm 30 years-old.

89
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,393
That's a totally reasonable age
to have a kid,

90
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,353
but to me
it's still terrifying, you know.

91
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,564
They have that show
16 and Pregnant.

92
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,608
They're should be a show called
25 and Pregnant .

93
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,028
I'd be like,
"Oh, no, those poor kids!

94
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:21,780
"They have their
whole lives ahead of them.

95
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,574
It's a shame
things turned out that way.
What happened?"

96
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,660
"Me and my husband
decided to start a family."

97
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,831
"Bbp!
Irresponsible decisions."

98
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,626
That show is the most
depressing television show
I've ever seen.

99
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,878
'Cause You know,
any other reality show

100
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,588
where there's like
a big fat guy or something

101
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,132
and at the end of the episode

102
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,425
he's eating right,
he's exercising.

103
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,636
You're like, "All right,
things are gonna get better.

104
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,722
"Yeah, things
are gonna get better.
Good job TV show.

105
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,432
Things are
gonna get better."

106
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,101
16 and Pregnant
and you're like,

107
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,561
"Whoa, that's
never getting better."

108
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,481
The only good thing
that happened this week

109
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,901
was the guy almost
got a job at Arby's...

110
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:02,863
and the girl
won a fistfight with her mom.

111
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:06,283
This is brutal.

112
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,452
And they don't do
anything nice for the kids
at the end of the show.

113
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,789
There's no money.
There's no new house.

114
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,125
Come on,
do something for those kids.

115
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,710
Like maybe at the end
of each episode

116
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,088
Xzibit could show up.

117
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,965
And the kids would be like,
"Oh, my God.

118
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,925
"Xzibit, are you here
to pimp our rides?"

119
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,220
And he'd be like,
"No, I'm gonna raise your baby
as my own!

120
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,471
You're free to go back
as being teenagers!"

121
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,973
And they'd be like,
"Thank you, Xzibit.

122
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,850
Thank you so much
for our lives!"

123
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,519
Then Xzibit would take the baby
and put it on a bus

124
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,479
with all the other babies
he's collected,

125
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,065
and then you do
a second show

126
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,734
about Xzibit trying to raise
30 babies by himself.

127
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:48,491
I, I do find
the 16 and Pregnant show
kinda mean-spirited.

128
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,118
You know, 'cause you got
a camera crew there, like,

129
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,037
"All right,
you don't have any money.

130
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,830
"No one's helping
you raise your children.

131
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,874
"All hope is lost...
And, cut!

132
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,209
"Good luck with everything.
We got to go.

133
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,586
"Let's go!
Sorry.

134
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,004
"There's this other
16-year-old girl

135
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,005
"that lives down the street

136
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,715
"that had
all the advantages in life.

137
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,134
"She's about to have
an amazing birthday party.

138
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,470
"We've got to film
that for a second show
called Super Sweet 16.

139
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:15,185
It's a shame you guys
can't switch places for a week
'cause her shit is sweet."

140
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,854
Ugh, I hate the girls on
Super Sweet 16.

141
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,147
Whenever I watch that show

142
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,648
I'm like, "Ugh, could someone
impregnate this girl

143
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,609
and ruin her life please?"

144
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,694
What an awful person.

145
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,530
That'd actually
be a better show.

146
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,699
If they just did horrible stuff
to that girl for a week.

147
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,994
"Meet Amanda.
She's 16 and horrible.

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,371
"So we cut the brakes
in her car.

149
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:35,538
"We put a bunch of holes
in her condoms.

150
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,416
Let's see what
happens this week."

151
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,341
Do those girls
not watch the other show?

152
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,802
Do they not realize
how fortunate they are?

153
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,096
They're sit there complaining
about the dumbest stuff

154
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,681
just like, "But, but, but,
it's not the right car.

155
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,558
It's not the car I wanted."

156
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,312
They just moved into a car
on the other show.

157
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:02,149
Three people are living in a
'89 Honda Civic Coupe.

158
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,026
There's more people
than doors.

159
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,821
"But the lights aren't right."

160
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,239
Their kid isn't right.

161
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,949
Their kid has a tooth
coming out of his nose,

162
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,951
and they can't pay for a dentist
with a tooth in his mouth.

163
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,369
The kid's
gonna have to brush his nose

164
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,663
for the rest of his life.

165
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,582
"But, but, but the balloons
aren't the right color."

166
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,293
Their kid
isn't the right color.

167
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,669
They had the wrong father.
That's how crazy

168
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,296
shit's getting over there!

169
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:28,216
It's a perspective.

170
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:33,554
Do any of you guys have kids?
A round of applause
if you got kids somewhere?

171
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,223
Wow

172
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,269
Aren't you scared
your kid's getting kidnapped
right now?

173
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:43,231
I mean, it's like
eleven O'clock on a Wednesday.

174
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:44,732
Where is your kid?!

175
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,526
Seriously.
Where is the kid?

176
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,778
Who's watching the kid?
Some dumb 15-year-old

177
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,822
that lives down the street
that's probably just

178
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:54,368
giving a hand job
to some other 15-year-old idiot.

179
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,952
Seriously, get out of here!

180
00:08:56,077 --> 00:09:00,957
Go! Leave! Leave! Go!

181
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,250
You're sitting there,
"Ah, ha, ha, ha!"

182
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:05,753
"Your kid's in handcuffs!"

183
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:08,173
Probably not.
Maybe, but probably not.

184
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,801
Look, I'm just saying.
I would be worried constantly

185
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,012
if I had a kid.
I think about
how much my mom

186
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,763
let me run around
when I was a kid.

187
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,725
Ten years-old
running around by myself...

188
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,728
going to the mall,
to the video arcade,
to the toy store.

189
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:23,730
Crazy.

190
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,691
I should've been
getting molested all the time.

191
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,026
Like, I don't know
how it never happened.

192
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,530
Not even once.
Not even once.

193
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,699
Keep in mind
I was the cutest kid
of all time.

194
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:38,953
Like, take the most adorable
little, brown puppy

195
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:42,790
you can imagine,
turn that into a person.
That was me as a kid.

196
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,625
I mean, who wouldn't be
trying to fuck that?

197
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,712
Just an unbelievable
level of cuteness.

198
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,631
My theory is
that I was so cute as a kid

199
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,468
that it intimidated
child molesters.

200
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,512
Like for child molesters,
I was kind of like

201
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,971
the hot girl at the bar.
They're like,

202
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,349
"Oh, my God,
Aziz is here! Aziz is here!
Aziz is here!"

203
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,809
Okay, you can do this.

204
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:04,479
You can do this.
Just be yourself.

205
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,981
Just be yourself.
Confidence.

206
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,735
Kids like confidence.
Let's do this.

207
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,780
"Hi, Aziz!" "Hi."

208
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,492
That's a, that's a cool uh...

209
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,661
Ha, ha, that's a cool uh--
That's a great...

210
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:25,125
All right, well, see you later.
Ah! You're so stupid!

211
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,171
You didn't even say anything!
Who am I kidding anyway?

212
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,841
This is Aziz
we're talking about.

213
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,885
He could fuck any
grown man he wants.

214
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,230
You know what's weird?

215
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,357
As I can tell,
you guys feel sad

216
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,733
for the child molester
in that joke.

217
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,112
I could see it in your faces.
You're saying,

218
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,407
"Ah, he's not gonna
get to fuck little Aziz.

219
00:10:57,532 --> 00:11:01,578
He seemed so nice."
You know what's strange?

220
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:03,538
At some point in your life
you actually got to sit down

221
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,499
and make sure
you weren't molested.

222
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,708
'Cause it could be buried.
That's the thing.

223
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,587
So at some point
you actually got to sit down
and think really hard.

224
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:16,092
It's like...

225
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,053
"No, I wasn't.
My childhood was cool.

226
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,722
I was mostly just
playing with trucks."

227
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,476
'Cause it can be buried.
If my stuff is buried,

228
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,810
I want it to stay buried.

229
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,312
I don't want to wake up
when I'm 43 and be like,

230
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,398
"Oh, shit!
I fucked my T-ball coach.

231
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:33,360
Totally forgot about that--
Buried."

232
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,031
You read these news stories.
Man, there's some

233
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,324
sick people out there.

234
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,242
You read these news stories.
Some sick people.

235
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,161
You read news stories like,
like, "Oh, the soccer coach

236
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,954
has molested
the kids for years."

237
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,998
For years?

238
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,959
Why do the kids keep going
back to the same soccer camp?

239
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:53,547
The only reason I ask that
is 'cause I quit soccer

240
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,882
'cause another kid
pushed me down on the ground.

241
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,509
If I was
forced to perform oral sex,

242
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,718
I definitely
would've been done.

243
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,804
That would've been it
for soccer.

244
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,098
There's no way
I would've went back.

245
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,893
That would've been
a firm deal breaker...

246
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,936
guitar lessons
would've started next Tuesday.

247
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,188
So...

248
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,273
Wh-what, is my mom
gonna get mad at me,

249
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,859
"Hey, Aziz, you got to go
to soccer practice."

250
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,445
"I'm not going."
"Really, young man?

251
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,988
Why aren't you going
to soccer practice?"

252
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,366
"Um, the coach is making
all the kids suck his dick!

253
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,867
"Is that enough reason
for me not to go?

254
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:27,288
"Is that enough reason?
Oh, am I grounded now?

255
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,166
"And no video games?
I'll take that over

256
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,002
"an old man jizzing on my belly,
"thank you very much.

257
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,713
"So send me
to my fucking room.

258
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,465
I'll be there not sucking
some old man's jig!"

259
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,638
"Knock on my door
when those cupcakes are ready."

260
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,104
You know what's crazy
is there must be kids
that talk like that now.

261
00:12:51,229 --> 00:12:52,647
You know what I mean?

262
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,899
'Cause kids
aren't innocent anymore.
They know everything.

263
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,234
In your head
you imagine a kid being like,

264
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,153
"Something bad happened."

265
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,822
Kids are like,
"A cock was in my mouth, Mom!

266
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,408
"Thanks for
signing me up for golf!

267
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,118
"It really
got me out of the house!

268
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,539
It also got
a penis near my face!
So thanks!"

269
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,874
If there's
anyone here from the paper,

270
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,876
feel free to quote that bit
in your article.

271
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,132
It's a scary time
to be a kid, man.

272
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,676
I just saw this documentary
about bullying.

273
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,094
And I know you're
always hearing that.

274
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,929
Oh, really,
kids getting bullied in school,

275
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,431
"that's what they're making
a big deal about now?"

276
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,224
That's kinda
what I thought going in,

277
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,059
then I saw
the documentary.

278
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,936
First scene,
kid is sitting on a bus,

279
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,354
he looks at
this other kid and goes,

280
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,564
"Hey, how's it going?"
The kid goes,

281
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,023
"I hate you.

282
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:40,236
"I'm gonna murder you
and cut your face off.

283
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,155
"I'm gonna put it on my face

284
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,242
"and then look in the mirror
and make fun of myself.

285
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,120
That's how much I hate you."

286
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,748
So I saw that and I thought,
All right, yep.

287
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:54,793
This is a problem.
Wow, that was terrifying!

288
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,919
God damn,
that's not bullying and teasing,

289
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,798
that's some demented shit
to say to another person.

290
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,382
Bullying and teasing
was the nonsense I did

291
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,133
when I was a kid.

292
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,384
"Hey, you're fat."

293
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,303
"Hey, you're brown."
"Shut up, you bozo!"

294
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,305
"Get out of here, you dingdong."
That's fine.

295
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,599
Do that all day,
no one's gonna get hurt.

296
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,100
I would've never
went up to some fat kid

297
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,145
and been like,
"I hate you.

298
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,398
"I'm gonna murder you
and cut your fat off...

299
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,276
"then use it to make a fat suit
and then dress up

300
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:24,531
"as a fat housekeeper
ala Mrs. Doubtfire.

301
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:28,159
And then I'm gonna
start working for your family."

302
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,996
No. That was a psycho zone
everyone agreed not to go into.

303
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,040
And it's so hard
to see this documentary

304
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,459
because nothing happens
to the bully kids.

305
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,002
They're beating the crap
out of the kid,

306
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,087
saying this awful stuff,
nothing happens.

307
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,465
That wouldn't fly
in the adult world.

308
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,509
That wouldn't be tolerated
in any workplace

309
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,093
or anything like that.
Like, that wouldn't fly in Ikea.

310
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,638
Like if you worked at Ikea

311
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,264
and you went up to some
other employ like,

312
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,099
"I'm gonna murder you,
you fucking dork!"

313
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,727
They be like, "All right Phil,
you can't sell lamps anymore.

314
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,812
Now get out!
You're done! Get out!"

315
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,522
"But look at him.
He's a nerd!"

316
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,566
"You're a psychopath!

317
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,026
Get your meatball
severance package and leave!"

318
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,115
I felt so bad for the kids, man.

319
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,242
They would try to tell
the teachers.

320
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,451
Teacher wouldn't do anything.

321
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,994
Kid goes up to
the teacher and says,

322
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,038
"Uh, he says he's gonna
cut my arms off

323
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,750
and glue 'em on my butt
so I can look like a minotaur."

324
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,210
Teacher is like, "Ah, well,
maybe he won't do it.

325
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:22,213
See ya later."
Do something, man.

326
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,841
I remember one time
when I was a kid

327
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,635
and someone actually
physically hit me

328
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,303
when I was growing up
in South Carolina.

329
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,639
I'll never forget what happened.
Kid hits me.

330
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,433
I go tell the teacher right way.

331
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,518
Teacher goes over to the kid
immediately and just goes,

332
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:40,981
"If you touch him again
I will end you."

333
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:43,401
And that was it.
Bullying done.

334
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,945
No one's ever bothered me
again in my life.

335
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,907
She scared everyone on earth.

336
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,158
'Cause that's how
the bullying should be handled.

337
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,452
'Cause that kid was like,
"All right, well,

338
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,162
"I don't want to be ended,
whatever the fuck that means!

339
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,581
I'll leave him alone."

340
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,128
Having a kid is a crazy gamble.

341
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,505
No one ever talks about it
in terms of being a gamble,

342
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,466
but it is.
Think about what position

343
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,760
in life you're in
when you decide to have a kid.

344
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,720
It's usually
a very safe position.

345
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,806
You know, you're married,
you found a mate.

346
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,933
That's huge.
You usually have a job
and a home.

347
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,017
That's very difficult
to lock down.

348
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:21,147
It's like you
finally put together this very
large complicated puzzle

349
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,023
and then you're just like,
"Fuck this puzzle!

350
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,693
Let's have a kid!"
And then the kid just shits

351
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,946
all over the puzzle.
The puzzle is ruined.

352
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,906
You're never putting it
back together again.

353
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,242
It's destroyed.
And now you have this kid.

354
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,620
And here's the gamble--
here's the scary part.

355
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,580
You can do everything right,
you can read all the books,

356
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,917
and you could still have
a total piece of shit kid.

357
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,627
You could have the worst kid.

358
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,795
You could have
one of the bully kids.

359
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,963
That could be your kid.
You don't know.

360
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,589
You could have a total
piece of shit.

361
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,716
Teacher's like,
"Ah, your son..."

362
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,678
"Yeah, I know.
He's shitty, okay?

363
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,971
"I hang out with him
all the time.

364
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,556
"He's the worst.
What do you want me to do, huh?

365
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:56,641
"I have to feed and shelter him

366
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,309
"or I get thrown in jail
for some reason.

367
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,854
"Ooh, I'm sorry
he's ruining your mornings.

368
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,356
"Guess who hangs out with him
on afternoons and weekends?

369
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,567
Me. So how about
a little sympathy for me."

370
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,486
"Well, sir,
have you thought about--"

371
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,321
"No! There's nothing
to think about.

372
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,406
"There's nothing to do, okay?
It's not his diet.

373
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,158
"He doesn't have
too much glutin.

374
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,037
"He's just shitty, okay?!
Some people are nice.
Some people are shitty.

375
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,373
"My kid is shitty, all right?
I've accepted it, all right?

376
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,291
"I made a mistake, okay?

377
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:26,295
"I gave up my best years
raising this monster!

378
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,507
"I could've started a band!
I play bass!

379
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:32,051
"But no, I didn't do that.
Instead I have this thing.

380
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,095
"Ooh, something that looks like
me and my wife put together.

381
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,473
"Uh, great.
Eat your vegetables.

382
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,599
"Can I throw a baseball
at your face

383
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,560
and you
catch it half the time?
Fuck me!"

384
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,572
Now, I'm not saying
I don't like kids.

385
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,574
I like kids.
I have fun hanging out
with my friends kids,

386
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,450
and joking
around with them-- whatever.
They're great.

387
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,161
But I do feel like
when I talk to my friends

388
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,581
that recently had kids,
it does seem they had to give up

389
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,042
everything for the kid,
and that's very scary.

390
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,585
You want to have a very
depressing conversation?

391
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,212
Talk to a couple
that just had a kid.

392
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,883
Ask them about the last night
they went out for themselves.

393
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,844
They will describe
the most boring typical

394
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:18,890
mundane evening out
with the same enthusiasm

395
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:24,186
a normal person
will describe a three-way
sexual experience.

396
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,480
I'll show you what I mean.
Over here, a guy describing

397
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,190
a three-way
sexual experience, over here,

398
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,360
a couple
that just had a kid.

399
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,863
"So we go back to my house,

400
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,075
"I got these two
really hot girls.

401
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,619
"So we go to the mall

402
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,497
I got two tickets
to Rango"...

403
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,874
I know what you're thinking.

404
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,627
Aziz, shouldn't you update that
to a more recent film?

405
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,088
No. These people go to movies
that are as old as shit.

406
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:54,258
They've been trying to see Rango
for a couple of years now.

407
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,890
Next thing you know,
they're taking
their clothes off.

408
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:05,103
Next thing you know,
we're eating nachos.

409
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,939
Skin is everywhere.

410
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:10,524
Cheese is everywhere.

411
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,235
Cheese is everywhere.

412
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,114
These girls were freaks...

413
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,743
Into freaky things
such as cheese.

414
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,996
Let me get a sense of you guys
as an audience.

415
00:19:23,121 --> 00:19:24,204
Clap if you're married
right now.

416
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,960
Clap if you're married.

417
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,544
You guys
here in the front.

418
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,964
How long did you guys
know each other
before you got married?

419
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,008
Five years?

420
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,300
That's always
an interesting figure to me

421
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,428
how long people knew each other
before they got married.

422
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,555
Clap if you knew your person
five years or less.

423
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,309
Okay.

424
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,146
Clap if it was
three years or less.

425
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,231
All right.

426
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,192
Clap if it was
two years or less.

427
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,367
We're all laughing 'cause
you'll probably get divorced.

428
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,703
That was a crazy idea.
Why'd you do that?!

429
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,871
You didn't need to do that.

430
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,539
You could've
just kept dating her.

431
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,125
Wh-- Why?
Why? Why? Why? Why?

432
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:13,963
What happened?
Did you lose a bet or something?

433
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,423
Look, of course,
I could be totally wrong.

434
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,134
You guys could be soul mates.
I don't know.

435
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,887
But to me two years
doesn't seem like enough time

436
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,388
to get to know someone

437
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,724
to know you want to spend
the rest of your life with them.

438
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:27,226
Two years? Two years?
I've had sweaters for two years.

439
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,769
You be like, "What the fuck
am I doing with this sweater?"

440
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,855
"Bbp, so stupid looking.

441
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,148
"I can't believe
I ever thought about

442
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,109
keeping that sweater
for the rest of my life."

443
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:40,823
That's a sweater.

444
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,076
Another thing people do
that scares me,

445
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,244
they'll marry
their high school sweetheart.

446
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,746
That's strange to me.

447
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,123
To meet someone when you're like
16 years-old and just go,

448
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:54,420
"All right, I'm done."

449
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:56,130
Well, I don't think
I'm gonna run into anyone
interesting

450
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,424
in my 20s or 30s.

451
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,178
I'm just gonna lock
this shit down now...

452
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,014
for no reason at all.

453
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,807
Think about all the dumb things
you believed

454
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,101
when you were that age.

455
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,727
Think about all the stupid
decisions you made.

456
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,395
Imagine being stuck with
any of those decisions

457
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,481
for the rest of your life.
Even just little things.

458
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,650
All right, well, I guess
I got this Bob Marley poster

459
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,569
over my bed for the rest
of my life.

460
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,654
It's cool though
because I took a bunch

461
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,198
of little photos
of Bob Marley

462
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,992
and I put it together
to look like a
big photo of Bob Marley.

463
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:28,495
It's a mosaic.

464
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,957
I just don't think
you have any idea

465
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:31,832
what your adult life
is gonna be like

466
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,333
when you're 16 years-old.

467
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,211
You realize how awful
my life would be

468
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,005
if it turned out the way
that I thought it was going to
when I was 16 years-old?

469
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:40,967
You know what my big plan was?
I was gonna go to college

470
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:46,513
and major in
Business and Biology.
That was the plan.

471
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,182
First I hit you
with the business

472
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,017
and you think
it's all done.

473
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,852
And then I come back--
Boosh!--

474
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,688
Hit you with the Biology.
What was I gonna do

475
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,941
with this stupid double major?!

476
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,443
Sell organs on the black market
very efficiently?

477
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,783
I have friends from college.
They're starting to get married.

478
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,119
I went to one of the weddings
and I asked the groom, I said,

479
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,079
"Hey, why did you decide
to get married?" He goes,

480
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,164
"Well, I don't know.

481
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,166
We've been dating
a few years now."

482
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:16,085
Wow! That's a terrible way
to answer that question!

483
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:17,753
Especially with
that tone and cadence.

484
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,090
Well, I don't know.

485
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,800
That's not the appropriate
tone and cadence

486
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:24,718
to answer that question.

487
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,137
That's the appropriate
tone and cadence

488
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:28,139
if someone's like, "Hey,
why'd you buy a FIJI water?"

489
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,099
"Well, I don't know.
The bottle looked kinda cool."

490
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,977
Perfect.
That's a fantastic moment

491
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:37,023
to use that
tone and cadence.
So well done...

492
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,441
That's also not a reason
to get married, you know.

493
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,401
"We've been dating
a few years now."

494
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,238
I've been eating
at the same taco stand
for a few years now.

495
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,283
I'm not gonna
commit to that taco stand
for the rest of my life.

496
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,993
Everything's following
my current relationship

497
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:50,744
with a taco stand.
Now if the taco stand

498
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,163
were to move into
my apartment with me

499
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:55,249
I might be up for that,
'cause then I'd have

500
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:58,002
delicious tacos
whenever I wanted but,

501
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:00,963
the economics
of taco stands wouldn't
allow such a thing.

502
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,756
I know what you're thinking.

503
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:06,135
Wow, Aziz just
compared women to tacos.

504
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,137
He must not think
that highly of women.

505
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:10,764
No, I just think
that highly of tacos.

506
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:20,440
One thing
I love about marriage though
is the proposal.

507
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,693
I think that is so sweet.

508
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,195
Here's this moment
where you know

509
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,946
you're gonna change
the life of yourself

510
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,406
and this person you love forever
and you can plan it out

511
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,492
and you can make it
the most beautiful amazing

512
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,162
perfect moment.
You don't get to do that

513
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,330
with most big moments
in your life,

514
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,707
but with the proposal
you can.

515
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:40,544
So, sir, five years guy,
what did you do to make it

516
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:45,883
the most beautiful amazing
perfect special moment ever?

517
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,262
Set the scene, okay?
What city are we in?

518
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:50,637
We're in Philadelphia.

519
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,014
Don't feel like
traveling too far.

520
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,640
Let's just do this
shit in Philly.

521
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,436
Okay, so we're
in Philadelphia.

522
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,981
Where are we at
in Philadelphia?

523
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,566
At a five star restaurant--

524
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,153
Don't worry,
not a three star-- a five star.

525
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,656
I like how you--
You couldn't wait
to say "five star."

526
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,742
You're like,
"Five star restaurant!"

527
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,000
We're at a
five star restaurant...Okay.

528
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,087
And so, you're at
the five star restaurant

529
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:26,590
and, you know,
it's dinner I imagine?

530
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,550
"It was lunch"!
Oh, shit!

531
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,304
I should'nt have assumed!

532
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,139
This is the
shit you leave out.

533
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,975
"Five star"...
Maybe the lunch prix fixe
won't be a big deal.

534
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,064
I mean, it's the same food!

535
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,943
They serve the dinner menu
at lunch, guys!

536
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:49,280
So lunch at the
five star restaurant.

537
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,282
I mean, at this point
you got to wonder,

538
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,866
Lunch at a
five star restaurant.

539
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,492
Dinner at a
four star restaurant...

540
00:24:57,288 --> 00:25:02,960
I feel like,
I feel like lunch loses a star.

541
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,212
There's no five star
lunch restaurants.

542
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,214
There's four star
lunch restaurants

543
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,509
that operate as five star
dinner restaurants.

544
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:16,682
Okay, okay,
we're at lunch,

545
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:19,143
five star restaurant...

546
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:23,439
and what period of the meal
do you decide to ask?

547
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,565
'Cause that's very difficult,
you know?

548
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,901
You can't ask like,
you know, before you order

549
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:28,986
'cause it's like...

550
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:32,448
What, he asked
before you ordered?!

551
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,951
What the hell?
Isn't that kind of
a scary idea?!

552
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,370
What do you want to have,
the most awkward lunch

553
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,456
of all time?!
"No?

554
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,501
Well, you want to split
some jalapeno poppers?

555
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,216
So you ask
before you even order?

556
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:53,219
Wow! And then,
Miss, did you-- what happened?

557
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:56,389
Did you immediately say "yes"?
What was the situation?

558
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,849
You didn't say anything?!

559
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,353
Well, that's even like
more morbid than saying "no."

560
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:07,941
"Do you want to marry me?"

561
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,114
All these people
are looking at me, bitch.
Say something.

562
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,953
You didn't say anything?
Were you thinking about?

563
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,873
Were you taken aback?
What happened?

564
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,251
You wanted to eat?!

565
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,592
You wanted to eat?
And were you down on one knee?

566
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,678
You were down on one knee
and you're just waiting.

567
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,806
And what's going on
through your head?

568
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,850
"The breadsticks
were coming out."

569
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,519
Hold up!
What five star restaurant

570
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,812
drops breadsticks
on the table?

571
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,824
Sir...

572
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,786
I'm gonna
ask you something...

573
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:03,830
and I need you to be
very honest with me right now.

574
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:08,668
This restaurant...

575
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,463
when it comes to their
breadstick policy...

576
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,594
does the word "unlimited"
come to mind?

577
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:39,617
I don't even
know what is happening.
I have done this,

578
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,828
I have done this in every city
on my tour...

579
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:47,207
this is the most bizarre
shit ever.

580
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,418
Did you see this coming at all?
Did you know this was coming?

581
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:53,547
Come on.
Come on, now.
Come on.

582
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:55,882
It's lunchtime...

583
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:06,268
The waiter has dropped
the breadsticks...

584
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,395
We've all read this book.
We know how this story goes.

585
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:14,568
Now I've talked to people
all over the country

586
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,320
about their proposal stories,
and you know what I learned?

587
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,531
I learned that ultimately
it doesn't matter

588
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:20,157
what you do
for your proposals.

589
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,242
Some people go and do this
big grand gesture.

590
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,952
Some people do
simple, sweet things.

591
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,080
Ultimately,
what's really beautiful

592
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,459
is that you found someone
to say "yes" to this

593
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,753
totally insane thing
you just asked them.

594
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,298
It's the most
insane thing you could ever

595
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:37,841
ask another person to do.
It really is.

596
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,093
It doesn't seem
as insane as it is

597
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,638
'cause we're all familiar
with marriage as an institution.

598
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,140
But imagine if marriage
didn't exist and you're a guy

599
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,600
and you asked a woman
to get married.

600
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,519
Imagine what that conversation
will be like.

601
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,688
You be like uh,
"Hey, so, you know,

602
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,980
"we've been
hanging out together,

603
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,566
"spending a lot
of time together..."

604
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,693
"Yeah, yeah, I know."

605
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,986
"I wanna keep doing that
'til you're dead."

606
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,578
"W-w-what?"

607
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:09,164
"I wanna keep
hanging out with you
'til one of us dies.

608
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,000
"Put this ring on your finger
so people know

609
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:14,336
we have an arrangement."

610
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,964
"W-what, w-what--
Who's that guy?"

611
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,635
"It's a priest.
I want you to swear to God

612
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,803
you won't back out
of this deal."

613
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,016
"W-w-what's he wheeling in?"

614
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:32,312
"It's a cake with two tiny dolls
that look like us.

615
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,149
"Eat a slice!

616
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,320
Now feed a little bit to me!"

617
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,617
"This is really strange.

618
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:46,826
Why are we doing this?"

619
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:49,663
"Tax purposes."

620
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:57,463
That's pretty much
what you're asking.

621
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,256
This is another thing
that baffles me about people

622
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:01,383
being opposed to gay marriage,
you know.

623
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,761
Here these people,
they found someone to say "yes"

624
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,179
to this totally insane thing

625
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:08,557
and then some other person's
gonna be like,

626
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,016
"No, it's weird.

627
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:13,145
I just-- I just--
I just think it's weird."

628
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,982
It's pretty much the only
argument at this point really.

629
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,485
I don't see how
you can really be opposed

630
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,527
to gay marriage
at this point.

631
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,237
Like you know
you're on the losing side.

632
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,573
There's no way it's not
gonna go through.

633
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:26,992
All the demographics
that are really opposed
to gay marriage.

634
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,410
They're all gonna be dead soon.

635
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,120
Like, whenever
they ask young people,

636
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,705
young people are like, "What,
what are you talking about?

637
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,206
"All music
is free right now.

638
00:30:33,332 --> 00:30:34,625
"What the fuck
are you talking about?

639
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,669
"Oh, two dudes are kissing?

640
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:41,173
I'm about to watch
every movie ever right now."

641
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:44,468
They don't care at all.

642
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:46,261
But seriously,
how do you not know

643
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,971
you're on the losing team
at this point?

644
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,641
These are the same people
that were opposed to like uh,

645
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:53,935
women voting
or black dudes playing baseball.

646
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,604
What was the last thing
they were opposed to?

647
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,481
Interracial relationships.

648
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:59,525
If you're opposed
to interracial relationships,

649
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,735
guess what?
I'm fucking white girls.

650
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,196
There's nothing
you can do about it.

651
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:12,412
Any time I have sex
with a white girl,

652
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:15,457
I think about those people
for a few pumps

653
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:19,044
and it's such
a great feeling.

654
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,587
Just like--

655
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,506
It's just not right!
Well, it's in there

656
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:27,052
so I don't know what
you're gonna do about it.

657
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,221
Seriously,
all of you here,

658
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,973
next time
you have sex with someone
of a different race,

659
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:34,476
think about those people
for a minute--

660
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,395
you really should do this.
It's very important.

661
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,690
It's your duty as an American,
and I promise you,

662
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,359
nothing feels better
than orgasming

663
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,819
while thinking about
all the progress we've made

664
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,279
in civil rights
in this country.

665
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,536
I still can't believe
it's an issue.

666
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:53,871
It just baffles my mind.

667
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,789
That whole
Chick-fil-A situation...

668
00:31:55,914 --> 00:32:00,419
Whew! That was quite
a conundrum for me.

669
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:04,339
'Cause, you know, obviously
I'm very pro-gay marriage,

670
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:09,219
but, I'm also very
pro-delicious chicken sandwich.

671
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:13,766
It's like, Ughh...
What do you do?!

672
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,185
I stopped eating Chick-fil-A.
I'm never gonna eat Chick-fil-A.

673
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,522
I don't eat it anymore.

674
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,108
That is the saddest thing
you could ever applaud.

675
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:26,403
"You are so brave, Aziz!

676
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,405
"How you find the strength
to resist those

677
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,699
"delicious chicken sandwiches
we will never know.

678
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,452
"But you are
a man of principle

679
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,580
and we applaud you!"

680
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,582
I mean,
I still eat the nuggets
all the time.

681
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,501
So it's not that hard.

682
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,254
No, no, I don't eat the nuggets.
I don't eat the nuggets.

683
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,547
I don't.
I don't.

684
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,716
But that was a
strange situation, right?

685
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,135
I was so jealous
of homophobic people.

686
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,055
Man, what a delicious way
to support your hateful cause.

687
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,227
I don't have opportunities
like that in my life.

688
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,104
I wish I did.
I wish the places

689
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,315
that made food
that I found so delicious,

690
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,943
also took political stands
I can get behind.

691
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,945
Like my favorite place
to get a cheeseburger

692
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,280
is Shake Shack.
I love Shake Shack.

693
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,616
It's so delicious.

694
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,452
You realize how excited I'd be
if I went to Shake Shack one day

695
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,871
and they're like,
"Hey, just so you know,

696
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,290
part of our profits now
go towards fucking over people

697
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:24,336
that work at United Airlines
customer service."

698
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:29,007
"What? What? Yes! Yes!
H-h-how are you doing this?"

699
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,884
"Well, any time
you buy a burger,

700
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,886
"part of the money goes towards
paying people on Craigslist

701
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,681
to shit in their cars."

702
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:38,308
"That's fantastic!
Can I get 75 cheeseburgers,

703
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,269
please?"

704
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,317
I do want to get married
at some point I think.

705
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,195
I'm not sure when.
I was in India recently

706
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,906
and my grandma asked me,
she goes, "Uh, Aziz,

707
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,324
when are you gonna get married?"
I was like,

708
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,368
"Egh, I don't know
if you'll be around."

709
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:00,038
She's old!

710
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,791
That was a fun trip.
Uh, I spent a lot of time

711
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,710
with a cousin of mine
that lives there.

712
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:06,044
He's around my age.

713
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,838
And it was really fascinating
to me the dichotomy

714
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,298
of our two lives.
My life is totally different

715
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,760
'cause I was
born and raised in America

716
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:16,095
and he was born and raised
in this poor part of India

717
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,514
where my family
is originally from.

718
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,599
My family's originally
from a poor part of India.

719
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,059
They're not from
the part of India

720
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,186
'study abroad programs'
are based.

721
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,230
They're from like
the South Carolina of India.

722
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:27,983
It's pretty rough.
For real.

723
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,776
Like the way you take
a shower there.

724
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:30,903
It's not
the way you take a shower here.

725
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:32,278
The way you have
to take a shower at their house

726
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,406
is you fill a bucket
with hot water

727
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,324
and you take a smaller bucket
and you pour the water on.

728
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,702
That's to conserve
hot water.

729
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,620
And it's a little strange
'cause, you know,

730
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:44,583
I jerk off in the shower
on occasion.

731
00:34:44,708 --> 00:34:46,877
If you're showering
with the bucket method,

732
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,461
you can't jerk off
in the shower.

733
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,464
Uh, that silence
is way too terrifying.

734
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,091
Even people that jerk off
in the shower here,

735
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,843
no one turns the shower off
and goes in the corner

736
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,469
like this--
Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat...

737
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,555
No, that's some
serial killer shit.

738
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,436
"Oh, so sorry,
that noise I made,
Dat-dat-dat...

739
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,688
That's not the noise it makes
when a dude jerks off.

740
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,316
Um... If some guy
comes up to you and starts
jerking off and he goes,

741
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,445
Dat-dat-dat... Look out,
that's a robot from the future

742
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:19,034
that's been sent back in time
to jizz in your face.

743
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:22,412
But the thing
about being there in India was,

744
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,497
you know, I didn't
feel like jerking off...

745
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,332
all the time.
You know, because there's

746
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:28,794
was less sexuality there.
Women are dressed

747
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,964
more conservatively.
There's not like sexy posters

748
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,591
and magazine covers everywhere.
It's a way different vibe.

749
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,217
I came back to New York
after that trip

750
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,304
and I was like,
"I wanna fuck everything!"

751
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:42,099
There was just so much sex
in your face constantly

752
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,684
and I never realized
just how desensitized I was.

753
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,770
You know, I see the most
graphic sexual imagery

754
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,688
and it goes to my head
like it's nothing.

755
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,440
I saw an ad
for a gym in New York,

756
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,191
this is
a real ad for a gym.

757
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:54,611
Okay, it's an ad
for Equinox gym.

758
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,529
This guy is
laying down on a couch,

759
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:57,906
his clothes
are coming off,

760
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,324
shirt's coming off,
pants are coming off.

761
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,785
There's a woman straddling him,
her clothes are coming off,

762
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,704
and it's just so sexual.
Like it honestly looks like

763
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,247
this woman was sucking
this dude's dick

764
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,874
and someone was like, "Hey."
She's like, "Huh?"

765
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,002
And they took a photo.
That's how sexual it is.

766
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,881
And I'm just sitting there
looking at this and it's like,

767
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:18,969
How did this
become an ad for a gym?
This does not-- How?

768
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:22,221
This would not fly in India.
They'd be like this,

769
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,431
"This has nothing
to do with gyms."

770
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,684
Please take this down.
This is...

771
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:28,145
This is a bit ludicrous.

772
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,480
So how'd it become an ad?
I'm not sure.

773
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,065
At some point
they must've had a meeting.

774
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,776
They're like, "All right, well,
we need a new Winter campaign.

775
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,945
"We need some ideas.
Bruce, what do you got?"

776
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,655
Here's what I'm thinking.

777
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,532
We have a gentleman
on an exercise bike.

778
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,117
He's riding the bike
and it says,

779
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:45,120
"Ride Your Way
To A Better You."

780
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:48,581
Hm, Bruce, I like that.
I like the tag line.

781
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:50,291
I like the imagery.
That's very nice.

782
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,668
I like that a lot.

783
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:52,585
Does anybody else have anything
they want to pitch?

784
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,962
David, what do you got?

785
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,380
I just got a photo
of two people fucking

786
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,049
and underneath it
I wrote "Equinox."

787
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:58,591
David, that's fantastic!

788
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:00,552
Let's put those up
all over town.

789
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,261
Bruce, pack your shit up
and get out of here.

790
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:07,517
You're done.

791
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,812
So, my cousin
is there in India.

792
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:13,481
Totally different life,
way more conservative lifestyle.

793
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,441
I don't think he's dating
or anything like that.

794
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,860
He'll probably
have an arranged marriage.

795
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:18,653
A lot of people in India
still have arranged marriages.

796
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,073
My dad had an arranged marriage.
It was to my mom.

797
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:25,202
That's how they arranged it.
And it's interesting.

798
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,204
Whenever I tell people that
they're always like,

799
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,622
"Oh, my God,
is everything okay?

800
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,541
Do they hate each other?

801
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,044
And they only ask that 'cause
it's an arranged marriage...

802
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,047
Those questions are totally
valid for any marriage.

803
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:40,092
Those people are married--
Oh, my God, is everything okay?

804
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:41,509
Do they hate each other?

805
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,470
See?
It still makes sense.

806
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,223
I read a little bit
about arranged marriage.

807
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,557
I read some
research and stuff they've done.

808
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,392
Very interesting.
I found this study they did

809
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,687
where they took couples
that had arranged marriages

810
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,564
and they took couples
that had non-arranged marriages

811
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,524
and they measured
their happiness levels.

812
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,276
In the first
three to five years

813
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,237
non-arranged couples
were happier.

814
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,031
But when I looked at it
25--30 years down the line,

815
00:38:03,156 --> 00:38:04,490
the arranged couples
were happier.

816
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,325
So, who knows?
I don't know.

817
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,453
My parents are just as happy
as any old white people

818
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,122
I've ever run into.

819
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,331
But, I don't think
I can do an arranged marriage.

820
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,084
I talked to my dad
about his experience

821
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,837
and, uh, you know, he was like,
"Well, uh, I met your mom

822
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:20,132
and a week later
we got married."

823
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:21,466
And I was like, "Whoa!

824
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,884
How long did you
talk to her for?"

825
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,763
He's like, "Hm...30 minutes."
Thirty minutes?

826
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:31,143
"Like an episode of 'How I Met
Your Mother' 30 minutes?

827
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,895
That's how you met my mother?"

828
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,605
Thirty minutes
isn't a lot of time, man.

829
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,399
Think about all the crazy things
you learn about people--

830
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,153
weeks, months,
years into a relationship.

831
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:42,862
I be like I would get
an arranged marriage

832
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,239
and three weeks in
I'd be like,

833
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,907
"What, you don't watch
"Game of Thrones?

834
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,701
"I knew shouldn't
have signed up for this shit.

835
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,412
"We should've discussed
DVR preferences.

836
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,665
"What did you erase
all my shows for?

837
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:57,335
Celebrity Ghost Stories?"

838
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,838
That's a real show,
by the way.

839
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:03,549
They asked me to be on
Celebrity Ghost Stories,
but, uh, I said no,

840
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,304
'cause I haven't
seen any ghosts.

841
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,806
I like ghosts though.
Whenever you hear about ghosts

842
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,432
it's always
the same kind of stories.

843
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,936
You know... "Ghost was wearing
old timey clothes.

844
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,604
"Ghost was turning
my lights on and off.

845
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,106
"Ghost was turning
my faucets on and off.

846
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,275
Ghosts,
I'm trying to sleep!"

847
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,734
It's like, all right,
take it easy.

848
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,653
These people
died hundreds of years ago.

849
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,615
They've never seen
running water before.
They're blown away.

850
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:32,037
They're just sittin' there...

851
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:36,541
Where is the well?
How is the water getting here?!

852
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,876
All the ghosts come in here
look at this.

853
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,838
Now it's dark-- Bsch!--
Now it's not-- Bsch!

854
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,840
They're not going "Boo",

855
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,968
they're going, "Oooh,

856
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,972
modern advances."

857
00:39:54,351 --> 00:39:56,144
I hope I see a ghost
at some point.

858
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,937
'Cause if I see one,
it would be very interesting

859
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:00,982
'cause I live in
a modern building--
a newer building--

860
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:04,027
so if I saw a ghost,
it would be like a modern ghost.

861
00:40:04,152 --> 00:40:06,112
You know, I would just wake up
in the middle of the night,

862
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,906
there'd be a dude
in the corner texting.

863
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,829
Boo.

864
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,497
Those would be
the best ghosts.

865
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,666
Those would be the best
ghost stories.

866
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,294
You come home one day,
you turn on your TV,

867
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,837
you look on your Netflix.

868
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,923
"What, 'Mad Men Season 5,
previously viewed'?

869
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,299
"I never watch--

870
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:31,679
"Ghosts!

871
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:35,308
They're on Season 5!"

872
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,519
Those would be the best ghosts.

873
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,355
You wake up
in the middle of the night,

874
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,065
there's some ghost
standing over your bed.

875
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,276
"What's your WiFi password?"

876
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,915
That was a long tangent
on ghosts.

877
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,461
But, I guess ultimately,
what scares me about marriage

878
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,881
is where do you
find this person?

879
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,884
You know, a lot of times
most successful relationships,

880
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,638
uh, people meet through work,
school, mutual friends.

881
00:41:13,763 --> 00:41:15,473
But what's most interesting
to me is when people

882
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,059
just meet in life,
just randomly.

883
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,144
You know, I have a friend,
he got married.

884
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,603
I asked him,
I was like, "Hey, uh,

885
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,439
where'd you meet your wife?"
He was like,

886
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:26,443
"I was leaving
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

887
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,987
"I was looking for my car.
I drive a gray Prius.

888
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,907
"I saw a different gray Prius.
I thought it was mine.

889
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,201
"I walked up to it.
I realized I had the wrong car.

890
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,703
"But I bumped into Carol.
We started talking.

891
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,705
That was that."
That's unbelievable.

892
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,749
Think about
all the random factors that had

893
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,669
to come together to make this
one moment possible--

894
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,797
this one moment that changed
these two people's entire lives.

895
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,966
First off, this guy has
to live in particular town,

896
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:51,968
then he has to get
a gray Prius.

897
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,053
Then, he has to need
to go to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

898
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:57,349
Then, he has to go to that
particular Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.

899
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,142
Then, there has to be another
guy who also lives in town,

900
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,559
also drives a gray Prius

901
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:01,769
and also needs to go
to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond,

902
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,855
also goes to that particular
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond

903
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:05,440
at around the same time.
Then, they have to both park

904
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,233
somewhat near each other.
My friend had to leave

905
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,818
before the other guy leaves.
See the wrong Prius,

906
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,820
thinks it's his, walk up to it,
then the woman, Carol,

907
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,738
needs to be near
the wrong gray Prius

908
00:42:12,864 --> 00:42:14,032
for a million other
random reasons.

909
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:15,367
They bump into each other.
They start talking.

910
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,160
Their entire lives are changed.

911
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:23,541
That's the most amazing
and terrifying thing about life.

912
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,461
It is 'cause the amazing thing
is that at any moment

913
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,628
any one of us
can have that moment

914
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,214
that totally changed our lives.

915
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:31,257
You could be leaving
the show tonight,
bump into someone...

916
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,884
It could change your life.
You don't know.

917
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:36,346
That could happen.
The terrifying thing is...

918
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:39,432
what if we're all supposed to be
at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond right now?

919
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,894
Doesn't that scare you?

920
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,771
I'm so scared of that.

921
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,273
What if you're missing
your moment?

922
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,649
What if you're not
supposed to be here?

923
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,026
What if I'm not
supposed to be here?

924
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,986
My friend's entire life changed
'cause he went to

925
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,864
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
one afternoon.

926
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,410
The most casual of decisions
had the most tremendous

927
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:00,328
of consequences.

928
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,289
Why did he go to
Bed Bath &amp; Beyond
that afternoon?

929
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:07,001
Well, his roommate
had clogged the toilet

930
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,879
and he needed to get some Drano.
Few weeks later

931
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,424
he's falling in love
with this woman.

932
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:14,759
It's amazing.
It's all 'cause

933
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:19,347
some other dude ate some
bad Chinese food one day.

934
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:21,599
And then years later
it gets crazier.

935
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,935
Those two people have a kid.
They come together and do

936
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,312
the most incredible thing
two human beings can do.

937
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:29,232
They bring a new life
into the universe.

938
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:34,153
It's all 'cause some other dude
took a really huge shit one day.

939
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:36,739
That's the most amazing story
you'll ever hear in your life.

940
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,367
No, don't look at me like that.
That's the most amazing story.

941
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,077
Who's ever take a huge shit
and thought,

942
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,662
"I just brought
life into the world."

943
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,546
Where do you meet this person?

944
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,006
I think it's very hard
to meet someone
you really connect with,

945
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,426
that you really feel
a deep connection with.
I think that's hard.

946
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,052
I don't think those people
just come around all the time.

947
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,512
I think it's
a very special thing.

948
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,432
And I think
it's very hard to find,
especially nowadays.

949
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,601
I mean, yes,
there's great people around,

950
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:08,271
but, man, there is so much
riffraff out there right now.

951
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:11,357
The percentage of riffraff
has never been higher.

952
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,651
It's very high.
I don't know.

953
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,613
Maybe I'm romanticizing
the past,

954
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,781
but you think about
like older generations,

955
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,575
you know, people in their
20s-- 60s, whatever.

956
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,619
You just imagine
a different vibe.

957
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,329
You know, imagine
men wearing nice suits,

958
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:26,664
women are dressed all nice,
everyone's speaking properly--

959
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,749
just a classier vibe.

960
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,794
Like if those generations
could be a font

961
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,631
they would be
"Times New Roman."

962
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:38,635
I look at my generation...
We're fucking Comic Sans.

963
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,762
You can't take us seriously.
We're Comic Sans.

964
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,515
People that are single
and out there,

965
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,391
you know what I'm talking about?
You go out with people sometimes

966
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:48,603
and you're just like,
"What, you're a person?!

967
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,981
"Hold up. You're a person?
How? You're so dumb,

968
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,983
"How are you--
How do you pay rent?

969
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,985
"How do you have a job?
How are you paying taxes?

970
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,821
How is the world not
crumbling around your idiocy?"

971
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,575
You meet people so dumb
you get scared for their safety.

972
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,701
You're like, "Shit, I'd better
walk this person home.

973
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,246
They might
just walk in the street
and get hit by a bus!

974
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:08,873
They can't even have
a conversation.

975
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,501
They're just
texting and Instagramming
photos of salt shakers.

976
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,878
What happened to people?!

977
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,507
You meet people so bad sometimes
they're not even Comic Sans.

978
00:45:17,632 --> 00:45:20,176
They're straight-up wing dings.
That's how scary it is.

979
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,641
So what do you do?

980
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,893
We learn to adapt.
We have new things now.

981
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,562
We have things like
online dating.

982
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,729
One in five relationships
is formed online now.

983
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:34,649
That's a true statistic.

984
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,941
I have a friend,
he met his wife

985
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:37,402
on one of those sites
and I asked him, I was like,

986
00:45:37,527 --> 00:45:40,655
"So, what'd you search?"
'Cause that's weirdly romantic.

987
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,450
He types in this phrase,
all these algorithms

988
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:46,160
and things come together,
this woman's face comes up,

989
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,246
he clicks it...
that becomes the woman

990
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:50,289
he spends
the rest of his life with.

991
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,666
So I asked him,
"What'd you search?"

992
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,836
And he goes,
"Jewish and my zip code."

993
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,047
"What, that's all
you were looking for,

994
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,551
"just something Jewish
close by?!

995
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:03,595
"You don't
want to drive too far?!

996
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,055
"Proximity was a
big factor here?!

997
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,473
"Jewish and my zip--

998
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,393
"I found a Wendy's that way
a few weeks ago!

999
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:13,688
"I typed Wendy's and my zip code
then I got some nuggets,

1000
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:17,900
he got a wife
the exact same way!"

1001
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:23,573
Some people still don't
want to do online dating.

1002
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,242
Feel like
there's a stigma to it.

1003
00:46:26,367 --> 00:46:27,744
That's strange though.
You ask those same people.

1004
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,036
"Hey, you ever
meet people in bars?"

1005
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,623
I was like,
"Yeah, sure. Why not?"
Don't you see?

1006
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,625
Online dating's the same thing,
it's just a different interface?

1007
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,543
In a bar you walk around
and you see people's faces.

1008
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,087
Online you see those same faces,
they're on a web page.

1009
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,381
The difference is
online dating is like

1010
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,925
going to a bar
and having superpowers.

1011
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,136
You know what I mean?
Online dating is like

1012
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:47,846
being able to walk into a bar
and just go, "All right,

1013
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:50,349
let's just eliminate
all the other dudes."

1014
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:54,103
Um, ooh.

1015
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,896
Let's eliminate any women
who that are already in

1016
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,274
relationships.

1017
00:46:58,399 --> 00:46:59,816
You can do
crazy things like that.

1018
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,444
You can't do that
in the real world.

1019
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,987
In the real world you can't
walk into a bar and go,

1020
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:10,827
"Jewish and my zip code."

1021
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,748
You can't do that.

1022
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,082
The other
interesting this is

1023
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,959
different sites
mean different things.

1024
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,877
You know, match.com.

1025
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:21,756
Looking for a relationship,
something a little more serious.

1026
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,050
okcupid. I'm trying
to fuck something tonight!

1027
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,222
eHarmony.
I'm gonna die soon.

1028
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:32,391
I don't wanna die alone!
How do we do this?

1029
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:33,685
I just got a computer
two weeks ago.

1030
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:38,606
Let's go!

1031
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,900
The craziest thing I've heard
with online dating is

1032
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:44,278
I have a friend who's gay
and I asked him, I said,

1033
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,822
"Hey, you ever do
online dating?" He's like,

1034
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:50,075
"Yeah, I use Grinder."
And I said, "What is that?"

1035
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:52,704
It's an iPhone App.
He turns it on,

1036
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:56,081
all these dudes faces
start popping up, I'm like,

1037
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,000
"Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who are these guys?"

1038
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,586
And he goes, "Oh, Grinder uses
my GPS to find the closest

1039
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,506
Grinder users close to me--
different circles by their face

1040
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,299
being what they're up for.
So this guy has a green circle,

1041
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:09,220
that means
he's ready to go, and...

1042
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:12,014
he's ten feet away.

1043
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,104
And then
I looked over I was like,
"Holy shit, there he is!"

1044
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,440
It was the same guy.

1045
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:24,151
That's the most
unbelievable technology.

1046
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,028
Straight people
are so pathetic.

1047
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:28,364
"Can I take you out
for a drink sometime

1048
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,907
or maybe we can
get dinner or something?
I don't know."

1049
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,036
Gay dudes are like,
"I wanna get my dick sucked

1050
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:38,791
and there he is...Done."

1051
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:49,093
That's a strange
impression of a dude

1052
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,303
getting his dick sucked.

1053
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:53,930
I mean, I never sucked
anyone's dick before,

1054
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,183
but if I was sucking
someone's dick and I looked up

1055
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,976
and they're just like,.

1056
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,104
I be like, "Hey, man,
you wanna be

1057
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,522
a little more appreciative?

1058
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,024
I'm sucking your dick,
for god-sakes!"

1059
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,988
I did a show one night
and this woman

1060
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:12,408
came up to me afterwards
and she goes, "Aziz,

1061
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,034
why don't they make Grinder
for straight people?"

1062
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,747
And I think they tried,
but it failed miserably.

1063
00:49:17,872 --> 00:49:19,707
'Cause I don't think any woman
wants to turn on her phone

1064
00:49:19,832 --> 00:49:21,876
and be like, "All right,
there's a guy 15 feet away

1065
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,044
"that wants to have sex with me.
Oh, wait.

1066
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,422
"There's a guy eight feet away.
There's a guy five feet away--

1067
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,048
"three feet away...
Okay, every guy around me

1068
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,676
"wants to fuck me.
Well, now I don't feel

1069
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:33,846
safe in the world.
So I'm gonna delete this."

1070
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,731
I really think that might be
the most incredible technology

1071
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:46,066
that's come out in my lifetime.
For real.

1072
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:49,153
I don't even know how you'd even
explain that concept to someone

1073
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,071
a few generations ago.
You show 'em an iPhone

1074
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,574
they're like, "Okay, it looks
like a mobile telephone device,

1075
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,910
"you use it to call other people
with similar devices--

1076
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,955
"have telephone conversations.
Uh, to be honest,

1077
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,415
"that part
doesn't work that well.

1078
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,335
"But, if you're interested
in putting your penis

1079
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,879
"inside some other man,
I can tell you for certain,

1080
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,423
that dude is down."

1081
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:20,100
I see why people are turning
to online dating though.

1082
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,728
You know, because if you
don't do online dating,

1083
00:50:22,854 --> 00:50:24,480
what are your other options
to meet people

1084
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:26,649
outside your
existing social circles?

1085
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:29,151
Your big options are bars
and nightclubs.

1086
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,987
Are you really gonna
meet someone like in a bar?

1087
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,280
I have friends
that go out with girls
they meet at bars

1088
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,491
and they're like,
"The girl wasn't that great."

1089
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,993
Yeah, of course
she wasn't that great.

1090
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:40,454
You met her at a bar
on a Tuesday at 1:30 a.m.

1091
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,874
That's when riffraff
is hanging out.

1092
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:44,959
You know what girl you're
gonna meet that hour is this,

1093
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:51,047
"Wheewwww!"
Is that noise as a person.

1094
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,218
That noise tells you everything
you need to know about

1095
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,345
a certain type of girl
'cause nothing nice,

1096
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,472
positive or intelligent
has ever come after that noise.

1097
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,558
It's always stuff like, "Whew!

1098
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,811
"Let's drink
the rest of the Tequila
out of that dumpster!

1099
00:51:03,936 --> 00:51:06,939
"Whew, give me an Orbits!
I just blew a guy

1100
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:10,150
"in the changing room at Target
and I forgot to get Orbits

1101
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:13,153
"which is why
I went there in the first place!

1102
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,657
"Whew, I'm really
attracted to that guy

1103
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,951
"with the backwards baseball hat
and the button-down shirt

1104
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:22,747
that's yelling
and being aggressive for no
apparent reason!"

1105
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:26,375
Those guys
are the male counterparts
to the "Whew" girls.

1106
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,420
Now, I don't dislike anyone
based on race, ethnicity,

1107
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,630
religion, sexuality,
anything of that nature.

1108
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,299
But, if you're a white dude
in a bar with a

1109
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:36,552
backwards baseball hat
and a button-down shirt,

1110
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:40,639
there's a pretty good chance
I fuckin' hate you.

1111
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,183
You know
who I'm talking about?

1112
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:46,270
They're not
always dressed that way.

1113
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,564
And of course I've met
gentlemen dressed that way

1114
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,066
that are nice,
thoughtful people,

1115
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,569
but I'm talking more about
a state of mind--an attitude.

1116
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:55,780
I'm talking about the guys
when you leave a crowded bar

1117
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:58,991
they'll say something like, "Yo,
bro, you were pushin' on me.

1118
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,451
You were pushin' on me.

1119
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:01,452
I had a drink in my hand,

1120
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:02,411
could've spilt it
all over my shirt.

1121
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,495
You need to watch
where you're going.

1122
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:04,120
If you were watching
where you were going

1123
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,581
we don't have a problem.

1124
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,625
You were pushin' on me.
You were pushin' on me.

1125
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:08,709
I had a drink in my hand,

1126
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:09,668
could've spilt it
all over my shirt.

1127
00:52:09,794 --> 00:52:10,669
You need to watch
where you're going.

1128
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:11,462
If you were watching
where you were going

1129
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:12,922
we don't have a problem.

1130
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,757
You were pushin' on me.
You were pushin' on me.

1131
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:15,716
I had a drink in my hand,

1132
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:16,675
could've spilt it
all over my shirt.

1133
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,760
You need to watch
where you're going.

1134
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:18,427
If you were watching
where you were going

1135
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,637
we don't have a problem.

1136
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,931
You were pushin' on me...

1137
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,475
I wanna sit
all these guys down one day
and just go,

1138
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,811
"No one's pushin' on you, okay?
This is a crowded place,

1139
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:28,729
there's limited room
and people are trying to leave.

1140
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,147
It's an accident.
No one's ever left

1141
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:33,609
a crowded bar, "Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

1142
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:36,487
"Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Sorry.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!...

1143
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:37,947
"Did you see it?
Did you see it?

1144
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,115
"I was pushin' on him!
I was pushin' on him!

1145
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:44,829
He had a drink in his
hand..." No!

1146
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:48,124
No one's ever done that in the
history of human interactions.

1147
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,334
But then that guy
wants to fight me now. Really?

1148
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,795
You got to fight me over this?
We're gonna fight now, really?

1149
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,630
This is the big battle
you've been training for

1150
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:57,299
with all the weights
and protein shakes?

1151
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:01,053
This to beat up me? Me?
A guy who's built the same size

1152
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:05,181
as a starting forward for a
JV girls basketball team?

1153
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,518
Don't you have some Asian symbol
tattooed on your arm

1154
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:11,689
you can look at that'll
calm you down for a few minutes?

1155
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,983
"Respect Thyself
and Environment."

1156
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:17,069
Sorry about that.
I forgot for a minute.

1157
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,698
Again, you never see those guys
saying anything nice,

1158
00:53:20,823 --> 00:53:23,199
positive or intelligent.
You never see them in a bar

1159
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,369
slamming a shot down.

1160
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:27,788
All right!
Let's be really quiet

1161
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,707
and respect
everyone else's space.

1162
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,463
You never seen them
slam a shot down----

1163
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:40,718
All right! Back to molecular
Biology lab, immunology--

1164
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:43,345
Let's go fuckin'
find a cure for Lupus, bro!

1165
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:49,601
You never seen them
slam a shot down----

1166
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,021
All right!
Those girls are really hammered.

1167
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:55,357
Let's make sure
they get home safe.

1168
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:59,361
No. Ah, I feel bad making
broad generalizations

1169
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,115
about men and women
like that, but...

1170
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,160
I'm pretty confident.

1171
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,870
To me it's one
of those things.

1172
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:11,665
It's like saying,
black dudes are blown away
by magic tricks.

1173
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,418
Stereotypes are fucked up,
but that's one's on point.

1174
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,338
If anyone has footage of a
black dude seeing a magic trick

1175
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,966
and not being blown away,
show it to me.

1176
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:24,220
I'll never say that again.
But until I see that footage,

1177
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:26,555
that's my favorite
racial stereotype ever.

1178
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,517
That's the best one.
Nothing comes close.

1179
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,145
Oh, what do you got?
Jewish people are really cheap.

1180
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:35,271
No, no, no.
When a black dude sees
a magic trick,

1181
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:38,442
his mind explodes.

1182
00:54:38,567 --> 00:54:41,946
Bu-bu-but Asian people open up
dry cleaning places a lot.

1183
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:43,989
No, no, no, no.
When a black dude sees
a magic trick,

1184
00:54:44,115 --> 00:54:45,991
for a few moments
he thinks it's real,

1185
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:48,535
like there's a sorcerer
on earth.

1186
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,788
If you don't know
what I'm talking about

1187
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,664
this is what happens,
all right?

1188
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,084
They see the magic trick
and then this-- Boosh!--

1189
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:58,045
They got to walk away a minimum
of 30 feet

1190
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:00,256
'cause everything
they know about reality

1191
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,425
has just been destroyed.

1192
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,804
They have to reassess existence
from the ground up.

1193
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:09,056
Well, what always happens?
They always turn around.

1194
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,891
That's amazing!
That's amazing! That's amazing!

1195
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,601
That's amazing!

1196
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,519
That's a beautiful way
to treat things in life

1197
00:55:14,645 --> 00:55:16,396
that you don't understand.

1198
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,774
You realize how much better
the world would be

1199
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:22,486
if we all just treated
each other the same way...

1200
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,447
black dudes treat magicians?

1201
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,449
I'm serious.

1202
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,286
What if homophobic people
saw gay people,

1203
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,704
they'd be like,
"Blah, it's so gross!

1204
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,998
"I don't understand
this lifestyle!

1205
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:36,875
why'd he get married?"
"Oh, wait.

1206
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,543
"This doesn't effect
my life at all
and any love and joy

1207
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,544
"in the world
is a beautiful thing.

1208
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:40,712
"It's amazing!
It's amazing!

1209
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,132
It's amazing!
It's amazing!"

1210
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:45,550
That'd be a better way
for them to conduct themselves.

1211
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:52,266
It's a real phenomenon.

1212
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,768
If you don't believe me,
this weekend

1213
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,062
go out to some fancy nightclub.
Look around.

1214
00:55:57,188 --> 00:55:59,773
See if you find an
African-American bouncer

1215
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,442
walk up he'd be like,
"Sorry, we're at capacity."

1216
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,987
And he'd be like, "Oh, really?
What if I give you the money?"

1217
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,114
He'd be like, "Oh,
we don't do that here."
And I'd be like,

1218
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,365
"Oh, yeah? What about
this quarter behind your ear?"

1219
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,993
He'd be like,
"Oh, shit, I didn't know
you were a wizard!

1220
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,452
"Come on in! Come on in!
Come on in!

1221
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,538
"Please don't turn me
into a bird!

1222
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:16,456
"Please don't turn me
into a bird!

1223
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:20,044
"Okay, I'm sorry.
You guys are cool.

1224
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:23,797
"You guys are cool.
I just need to see an ID.

1225
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,842
"What do you mean
check my back pocket?

1226
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:28,886
"Whoa, that's amazing!
That's amazing!

1227
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:31,263
That's amazing!"

1228
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:41,315
I've been ragging on those kind
of jock-like-frat meathead guys,

1229
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:44,109
but if you want me to be honest,

1230
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,153
I really feel like
all guys of this generation

1231
00:56:46,278 --> 00:56:48,572
is kind of
a sad state of affairs.

1232
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:52,534
Like, gentlemen are gone.
We just have 'dudes'.

1233
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,079
I get so bummed out
when I talk to my friends

1234
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:57,206
that are like single females
when you talk to them

1235
00:56:57,331 --> 00:56:59,708
about what they're looking for.
It's such a sad conversation.

1236
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,670
They're just like, "You know,
just someone nice...

1237
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,173
and clean."

1238
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:07,716
That's pretty much
all they're looking for.

1239
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:10,552
The bar is so low right now.

1240
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,055
Like, if you're a nice dude
and you're clean,

1241
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,766
like you brush, shower,
use deodorant every day,

1242
00:57:15,891 --> 00:57:18,185
you're in the top one percent.

1243
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,562
You can pretty much
fuck anybody, I promise.

1244
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,314
Just be nice and clean,
women will take notice.

1245
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,899
Don't try to act cool.

1246
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:25,776
Just be nice and clean,
women will notice.

1247
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,528
They'll be like,
"What? What? What?

1248
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,614
"You just held the door
open for me

1249
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:32,032
"and you're wearing pants?

1250
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,660
Come on, let's go.
Let's go!"

1251
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:41,208
I haven't seen a dude
in 'not' cargo shorts
in three years.

1252
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:45,045
Nice and clean.
"What? What? What?

1253
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,257
"Did you just
lift that heavy box and help me
load it into my car?

1254
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:51,760
"Can you lift your penis
and load it into my vagina

1255
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:55,555
because...I thought
courtesy was dead."

1256
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,976
Nice and clean.
"What? What? What?

1257
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:02,187
"You just texted me and
it wasn't a photo of your dick?

1258
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:06,442
Come on, let's go.
This guy just texted me words!"

1259
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:11,196
Wow. There's no sadder sign
of the times than that, huh?

1260
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:14,825
Men are out there texting
women photos of their penis.

1261
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:16,618
All the time.

1262
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:17,953
You want to see
something amazing?

1263
00:58:18,078 --> 00:58:20,831
Watch this.
Clap if you're a woman
in the audience.

1264
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:25,627
Okay.

1265
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:29,881
Now clap if a dude has sent you
a dick photo before.

1266
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:36,221
Was there even
any difference in the applause?!

1267
00:58:36,347 --> 00:58:38,140
There was just like
two people who were like,

1268
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,851
"Well, I don't have
a cell phone. So...

1269
00:58:40,976 --> 00:58:46,064
"I guess I haven't gotten one,
but many have been

1270
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,358
emailed to me, yes,
but, uh"...

1271
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:49,401
That is so crazy.

1272
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:53,405
How did such a bizarre thing
become so commonplace?

1273
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,492
That's unbelievable.
Thirty years ago,

1274
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,869
if I went up to some woman
and I was like, "Hi.

1275
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:04,416
"I, uh, recently
took some photos of my penis...

1276
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,712
"and, uh, I just got 'em
developed and...

1277
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,467
"some of the shots
look fantastic.

1278
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:17,179
Could I maybe
get your mailing address,
send you a few copies?"

1279
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:20,015
I'd get thrown in jail
the next day

1280
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,143
and the headline would read,
"Polaroid Dick Bandit Busted!"

1281
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,313
It's a strange thing.

1282
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:27,939
And Miss, you sitting here
in the front,

1283
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,108
you said a guy
sent you a dick photo.

1284
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,486
Now tell us about this.

1285
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:34,988
Now first off, this doesn't
reflect badly on her

1286
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:37,574
some dude fucked her phone
without her permission.

1287
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,951
Now who was this guy,

1288
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,703
was this a guy
you were dating,

1289
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,622
was it a guy you just met?
What was the situation?

1290
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,833
You don't want to talk about it?

1291
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,295
I mean, it's not a big deal.

1292
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,797
All right, Miss, you sitting
here right next to her...

1293
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,680
A guy sent you
a dick photo, right?
Tell us about this.

1294
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:01,932
Now was this a guy
you were dating,

1295
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,310
was it a guy you just met?
What was the situation?

1296
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:13,151
Let's say...
the most recent time.

1297
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:19,032
She's like, "Aziz,
you don't understand my life.

1298
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:23,036
I have an archive."

1299
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,080
Let's say the last time
it happened.

1300
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:26,706
Was this a guy you were dating,
was it a guy you just met?

1301
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,501
"Dating"? About how long
into the relationship

1302
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,587
before it was like,

1303
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:33,964
"I'm gonna so something
romantic today"?

1304
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,759
A month in?

1305
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:41,888
And when he sent the photo,
did he say anything

1306
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,933
with the photo
or was it just the photo?

1307
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,726
Just the photo.

1308
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:49,980
That's what I thought.

1309
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:53,817
Folks, this is another thing
I've learned in my research.

1310
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:57,821
Approximately 88.9 percent
of all dick photos...

1311
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:02,451
have no message.
Just the photo.

1312
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,287
Such a strange display
of male arrogance.

1313
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:09,416
It's like, "What am I gonna do?
It speaks for itself."

1314
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:12,169
So stupid!

1315
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:14,879
First off, everyone knows
what your dick looks like.

1316
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,382
No one's surprised.
All dicks look the same.

1317
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:19,259
They're just
dumb and boring looking.

1318
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,927
No one's ever got
a dick photo and they're like,

1319
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:24,515
"Wow! It's so beautiful!
I've never seen one like this!

1320
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,266
"Everyone, come in here
look at this glorious penis

1321
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:29,227
I just got sent!
Ah! It sparkles!"

1322
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:33,064
No. They all look the same.
Yes, there's some variations

1323
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:36,360
in size here and there,
but generally, everyone knows

1324
01:01:36,485 --> 01:01:38,945
what your dick looks like,
unless it's not circumcised.

1325
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,238
In which case,
it's terrifying.

1326
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:43,325
Keep it to yourself!"

1327
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:54,252
So, next this guy
sends you a dick photo.
No message.

1328
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:57,339
And, did you
write anything back,
or did you say like,

1329
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:58,756
"I'm not gonna say anything"?
What was the situation?

1330
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:01,009
'Cause that's
a tough situation, right?

1331
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,636
Like if you don't
write anything back

1332
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,514
it's hard for him to like
change the conversation.

1333
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:10,602
You can't send a dick photo
and be like, "Uh...

1334
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,480
You wanna go
to a five star restaurant
later maybe?"

1335
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:17,942
That's a tough predicament.

1336
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,820
The last question
I want to ask you.

1337
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,364
The photo you got,

1338
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:24,991
was the gentleman
erect in the photo?

1339
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,826
Yeah, I guess so,
right?

1340
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:28,286
You can't send one
where it's like--

1341
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,457
Can you help me?!

1342
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:37,421
Ughh!

1343
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:43,218
That's not
a strong move at all.

1344
01:02:43,343 --> 01:02:45,970
I'm gonna do the rest
of the show like this.

1345
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:51,976
No other comedian's
done a special from this
squatting position.

1346
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:55,063
No, I'll stand back up.
I myself, I've never sent anyone

1347
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,274
a dick photo,
but I wanted to do an experiment

1348
01:02:57,399 --> 01:03:00,026
to see what it would be like
to actually send someone

1349
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,071
a dick photo
and see what kind of reaction
you would really get.

1350
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,906
So I did an experiment.
I had a friend.

1351
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,408
She didn't have
my cell phone number.

1352
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,577
I got her cell phone number
from another friend

1353
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,954
and I decided
to send her a dick photo.

1354
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,707
So, I downloaded
a white dick

1355
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,334
off the Internet.
I ran it through a bunch of

1356
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:19,212
Instagram Hipstmatic-type
filters, made it looked like

1357
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:23,592
a really hip dick...
and then I sent it to her.

1358
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:26,595
And this is what happened.
So first off,

1359
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:29,222
I just sent kind of like
a generic hello-type text

1360
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,391
and I was like,
"Hey, uh,
good meeting you

1361
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,101
the other night, Libby.
What're you up to?"

1362
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:34,478
And then I sent her
the dick photo

1363
01:03:34,603 --> 01:03:36,730
and underneath I wrote,
"Boom!"

1364
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,278
An hour goes by...

1365
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,904
No response.

1366
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:48,325
Now, I want to keep
the conversation going,

1367
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,536
but I don't
want to seem too eager,
so I just send her

1368
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:55,582
a text that just says,
"Question mark."

1369
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:58,627
She writes back,
"Who is this?"

1370
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:01,129
I said, "We made out at the club
a while back,

1371
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,964
and you said I should give you
a buzz sometime.

1372
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:05,467
Well-- Buzzzzzz."

1373
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,763
Twenty minutes go by.
No response.

1374
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:12,223
I write,
"I feel like you don't like me.

1375
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,143
"Don't be mean.
By the way, did you get
my earlier text?"

1376
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:19,731
Dick photo again-- Boom!

1377
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,942
She writes back, "I don't
respond to people I don't know

1378
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:24,986
sending me pictures
of their dick."

1379
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:30,450
I said, "That's too bad.
I thought you were special."

1380
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,953
Twenty minutes go by.
"I still do."

1381
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:37,123
She writes, "Stop texting me!
Delete me off your phone!

1382
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:42,337
Never contact me again!"
And I said, "That's cold.

1383
01:04:42,462 --> 01:04:46,132
"I'm gonna store you in my phone
as 'Liquid Nitrogen'

1384
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:51,054
'cause that's how cold you are."
An hour goes by.

1385
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,682
"If you were inside a barrel
and someone dipped

1386
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:56,059
"a banana inside you
and they dropped the banana

1387
01:04:56,184 --> 01:04:59,646
"on the ground,
the banana would shatter...

1388
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:03,483
'cause that's
how cold you are."

1389
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:08,238
Another hour goes by.
"If you were inside a truck
and the truck flipped over

1390
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:12,992
"and you spilled all over the
T-1000 from Terminator 2...

1391
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:17,664
he would harden...
'cause that's how cold you are."

1392
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:22,001
She writes, "I know what
liquid nitrogen does!

1393
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:25,922
Stop texting me!"

1394
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,759
And then I realized I only had
one last text to send her.

1395
01:05:28,884 --> 01:05:32,512
So, I sent her a photo
of a soft penis and I wrote,

1396
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:35,891
"This is what
my heart feels like right now."

1397
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:46,526
What is today?
Today is what, Wednesday? Yeah?

1398
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,737
Anybody got any big plans
for the weekend?

1399
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,280
Anybody going to the club
over the weekend?

1400
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:53,074
Clubs are crazy places, man.

1401
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,034
That's a crazy place to try
to meet someone--at a club.

1402
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,203
People that go to clubs
know it's bad though, right?

1403
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,790
No one goes to a club like,
"All right,

1404
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:02,542
"it smells like vomit,
I can't hear anything,

1405
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,043
"and the worst people
in the world are here.

1406
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:07,130
Let's do this!"

1407
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:09,674
No. They know it's bad.
But when you look in a club

1408
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,803
people are having a great time.
They're having the best time.

1409
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:14,387
You know why?

1410
01:06:14,512 --> 01:06:16,765
It's 'cause the music
they play in nightclubs

1411
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:18,809
tricks people into thinking
they're having a good time.

1412
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:21,394
There's this
new kind of song that's come out

1413
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,480
that kind of brainwashes people
into thinking

1414
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:25,982
they're having a great time.
Think about it.

1415
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,150
What kind
of song is playing

1416
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,276
any time you walk into
a club now?

1417
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:29,360
It's always something like,

1418
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:16,366
And, if it's not
one of those songs,

1419
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:18,952
it's one of these songs
where the rapper or the singer

1420
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:22,246
is engaging in these
very luxurious activities

1421
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:25,709
and simply by virtue
of listening to the song,

1422
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:29,671
you are now
somehow also partaking in these
activities with them.

1423
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:31,047
Like I'd be
one of those songs like,

1424
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:14,173
Dude's in the club,

1425
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,884
"Oh, shit!
I'm on a jet right now?

1426
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,844
"Where're we flying to?
I got work tomorrow!

1427
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:18,929
"Who's paying for the jet?

1428
01:08:19,054 --> 01:08:20,137
"Don't put it on my tab!

1429
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,472
"No, we can't split the jet!

1430
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,726
I didn't even
have any of the jets!"

1431
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:27,729
They should make a song
that's like a reality check

1432
01:08:27,854 --> 01:08:30,189
for all these people, you know?
Maybe a song that's like,

1433
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,265
Philadelphia,
thank you so much!

1434
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:12,649
Thank you!

1435
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,953
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1436
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:27,080
Thank you so much!

1437
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:29,833
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much!

1438
01:09:29,958 --> 01:09:33,628
Thank you!

1439
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:36,131
Thank you so much.
Wow, wow, wow!

1440
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:39,300
I-- I can't tell you
what a treat it is for me

1441
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:43,387
to get to travel around
the country and perform in
lovely theaters like this.

1442
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,765
It's my favorite thing
I get to do in my career

1443
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,143
and, uh,
I thank you for that.

1444
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:50,353
I have found no matter what I do
in my career though,

1445
01:09:50,478 --> 01:09:54,941
my dad is never impressed.
Like, uh, he'll call me up,

1446
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:57,234
he's like, "What are you doing
this summer?" I'm like,

1447
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,653
"I'm going to do this
big theater tour,

1448
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:00,404
do a part in this movie."
He's like,

1449
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,448
"What part are you doing
in the movie?

1450
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:05,201
"Are you
starring in the movie?"

1451
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:06,870
I'm like, "No, just one
of the smaller parts."

1452
01:10:06,995 --> 01:10:10,165
He's like, "Why aren't you
starring in the movie?"

1453
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,125
I'm like, "You're a
Gastroenterologist.

1454
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:13,793
"You put cameras
in peoples butts.

1455
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,212
"Why don't you go star
in a movie?

1456
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:19,423
I saw your last movie.
It was shit, literally."

1457
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:23,011
This is true.

1458
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:25,180
One time I sent him
this video clip.

1459
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,765
I performed at this event
that President Obama spoke at

1460
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,143
and I spoke and then
the President spoke.

1461
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:32,395
When the President spoke,
he mentioned me in his speech.

1462
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,857
He gave me a shout out.
He was like, "Aziz Ansari,

1463
01:10:35,982 --> 01:10:37,608
"I wanted to thank you
for what you said earlier.

1464
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,943
"I also want to let him know,

1465
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:41,905
Aziz, I got more Twitter
followers than you do, man."

1466
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:44,782
And I was like, "Whoa,
the President just burned me.

1467
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:47,160
That's pretty cool."

1468
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:49,370
I send the clip to my dad.
He writes me back.

1469
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,372
"Why don't you have more Twitter
followers than the President?"

1470
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,545
I got to meet the President
at that show.

1471
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,589
That's pretty crazy.
You never think

1472
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,966
You're ever gonna get to meet
the President.
And I was so nervous.

1473
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:04,343
You know, I was downstairs and
it was just me and "The Roots."

1474
01:11:04,468 --> 01:11:06,345
"The Roots" had performed
at this event as well.

1475
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,973
And he's coming down--
Yeah, they're fantastic.

1476
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:12,685
From Philadelphia, right?

1477
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,521
And, uh, you know,
so he's coming down.

1478
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,606
I'm very nervous, you know,
'cause there's like

1479
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:17,732
Secret Service guys around--

1480
01:11:17,857 --> 01:11:18,733
"POTUS will be down
in two minutes.

1481
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:19,692
"POTUS will be
down in two minutes.

1482
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:21,611
POTUS down in two minutes."

1483
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:24,781
And I'm expecting something
very brief, quick and formal.

1484
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:26,866
You know, just like, "Thank you
for your time-- Photo.

1485
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:28,367
Thank you for your time--
Photo.

1486
01:11:28,492 --> 01:11:29,702
Thank you
for your time--
Photo.

1487
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:31,037
That's what I'm expecting.
All right?

1488
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,747
This what happens instead.
I'm not exaggerating.

1489
01:11:32,872 --> 01:11:36,709
He comes down----
Oh, snap! It's "The Roots"!

1490
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,461
What's goin' on? You guys
are like my house band.

1491
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,463
You're at every event.
And I'm just there like,

1492
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:45,509
"What? That's how he talks?"
And he's just running around

1493
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:48,054
chopping it up
with all "The Roots" guys,

1494
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:51,307
being very charming and cool.
And, uh, he goes up

1495
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,684
to one of "The Roots"
who has like a flower lapel

1496
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:56,020
in his jacket,
something kinda like this,

1497
01:11:56,146 --> 01:11:58,273
and he's like, "Uh,
what is this?
Are you a magician?

1498
01:11:58,397 --> 01:11:59,315
"You can pull a rabbit
out of there?

1499
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,359
Look at this fool--
Ha, ha, ha!"

1500
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:04,070
Which, by the way,
further backs up

1501
01:12:04,195 --> 01:12:06,030
my black dude
magician theories

1502
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:10,118
cause...

1503
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:14,247
I have not seen the rabbit
out of the flower trick.

1504
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,252
So he says hi to them
and he finally--

1505
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:21,462
he comes over to me
and, uh, we start talking.

1506
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:23,714
He's very nice,
super charming...

1507
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,549
Exactly how you'd hope
for him to be

1508
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,218
and it's time for us
to take a photo.

1509
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,220
And I'm there
with a friend of mine
and she has a purse.

1510
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:31,055
And he's like,
"Let's get a good photo
of the three of us.

1511
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:32,723
"Let's get a good photo.
Ah, put your purse down.

1512
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:33,975
"Don't worry about your purse.
Your purse will be fine.

1513
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:38,604
We got good security
back here. Ah-hah!"

1514
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:39,772
And that's when I realized

1515
01:12:39,897 --> 01:12:42,358
this dude acts
the exact same way I would act

1516
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:46,196
if I was the President.

1517
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:50,241
Just running around,
talking shit, cracking jokes.

1518
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:51,951
"What's up?!
How much did we raise tonight?

1519
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:54,495
"$5 million? Fuck it.
Let's go to the club.

1520
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,122
"Let's celebrate!

1521
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:58,833
"Turn that
into a campaign event,
$20,000 a head.

1522
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,044
I'm DJ-ing.
DJ POTUS, let's go!"

1523
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:13,472
These are my favorite gigs
I get to do as a comedian.

1524
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,183
A lot of times
when you're a comic

1525
01:13:15,308 --> 01:13:16,475
you get asked to do these
weird things

1526
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,435
that make no sense like,
um, I got asked to go to this

1527
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,271
charity event once.

1528
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,565
It's this charity called
"Make It Right."

1529
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,275
They rebuild homes in the lower
9th ward in New Orleans.

1530
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,943
It's a very cool cause.

1531
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:27,611
And they're like, "Aziz,
could you help us out?"

1532
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:29,405
And I was like, "Sure.
What do you need?"

1533
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,033
They're like,
"Could you host our
After Party?"

1534
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,910
And I was like,
"What does that mean?"
They're like,

1535
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:38,789
"Could you introduce Seal?"
And I was like, "The singer guy,

1536
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,791
like, "I am just gonna
go up there and say some stuff

1537
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:44,420
and then
Seal is gonna pop up?"

1538
01:13:44,545 --> 01:13:47,965
"Yeah."
And I was like,

1539
01:13:48,091 --> 01:13:49,508
"You know what?
I love New Orleans.

1540
01:13:49,633 --> 01:13:50,927
This sounds cool.
Let's do it."

1541
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,388
So I'm there in New Orleans.
I'm backstage with Seal.

1542
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:57,975
Seal has no idea who I am.
I'm not on Seal's radar, sonar--

1543
01:13:58,101 --> 01:14:02,313
nothing, and...

1544
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:05,441
it's time for me to do his intro
and this is what I do.

1545
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,443
I go onstage, I go,
"Ladies and gentlemen,
our next performer,

1546
01:14:07,568 --> 01:14:09,528
"he's actually running
a little bit late.

1547
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:12,073
"So, uh, he wanted to know
maybe if I can sing

1548
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:14,409
one of his hit songs for him
in order to kill some time.

1549
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,702
So, I guess there's nothing
left to say but--

1550
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,340
What's that, Seal's here?
Sorry, I can't hear you.

1551
01:14:35,346 --> 01:14:37,223
What's that?
Seal's ready to go?

1552
01:14:37,348 --> 01:14:38,308
Hm, I feel like at this point

1553
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:39,850
maybe I should finish
my version.

1554
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:50,611
And I did that shit
for way too long and...

1555
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,281
Finally I bring Seal up.

1556
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:54,615
Seal doesn't even
say anything to me.

1557
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,617
He just puts his arm
around my shoulder and goes...

1558
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:59,495
'Cause I get it, you know?

1559
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:01,747
Seal doesn't know
I'm a comedian.

1560
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,666
He just thinks
I'm some crazy brown guy

1561
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:07,003
that's seizing the moment...

1562
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:11,090
So I can impress Seal
and sign to Walrus Records

1563
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:15,011
and start my R&amp;B career
as The Brown Penguin.

1564
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:18,639
But the event went well.

1565
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:22,059
I did get to meet Seal.
Very nice, very smooth.

1566
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,520
Everything he said
was so smooth.

1567
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:26,897
You know, I was standing
in a elevator with this girl.

1568
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:29,984
He looks over.
He goes, "My only regret

1569
01:15:30,109 --> 01:15:31,819
"is that
I do not have a photograph

1570
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:35,114
to capture
this moment...forever.

1571
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:39,452
And I was just like,
"Oh, my God.

1572
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:45,291
"Seal, I wanna fuck you.
That was...beautiful.

1573
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:47,710
No one ever speaks to me
like that."

1574
01:15:47,835 --> 01:15:50,296
And then I realized
Seal's lyrics are not lyrics.

1575
01:15:50,421 --> 01:15:53,549
That's how he talks
all the time.

1576
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,718
Seal's at the optometrist.
The optometrist is like,

1577
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:57,470
"Seal, what's wrong with
your eyes?" He's like,

1578
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:13,944
"Seal, what the hell
are you talking about?

1579
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:15,612
"The weather
should not be affecting

1580
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:17,865
"your vision that way, Seal.
We need to run some tests.

1581
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,950
"Sheila, get a bunch
of snow here.

1582
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:23,996
Let's see if Seal's eyes
start getting wide."

1583
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,789
You're at a dinner party
with Seal.

1584
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,291
"Seal, how's the chicken?"

1585
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:55,069
So...So the event went well.
I had a good time.

1586
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,321
The next day
they had another event.

1587
01:16:57,447 --> 01:16:59,574
It was like a charity dinner,
charity auction.

1588
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,075
So I went to that.
Had a lot of fun.

1589
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,786
They had a lot of wine there.
I drank a lot of wine.

1590
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,955
And then the next day
I woke up and I was like,

1591
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,124
"Oh, Wh-what did I do
last night?"

1592
01:17:08,249 --> 01:17:11,419
We've all had those moments.
I had maybe one of the most

1593
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:14,422
bizarre instances
of that happening though.

1594
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:15,631
'Cause I woke up
the next morning I was like,

1595
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:17,133
"Oh, what did I do last night?

1596
01:17:17,258 --> 01:17:21,262
I think I bid and won a
charity auction to be an extra

1597
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:27,017
in the next Tyler Perry movie.
Yep, this is 100 percent true.

1598
01:17:27,143 --> 01:17:32,273
I paid an exorbitant amount
of money at a charity auction

1599
01:17:32,398 --> 01:17:37,487
so me and a friend of my choice
could be extras

1600
01:17:37,612 --> 01:17:41,949
in the next Tyler Perry movie.
So, next summer

1601
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:45,495
when you go to see a
Madea Goes To Jail 3

1602
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:50,040
and you see me and Seal
in the background just...

1603
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,543
You'll know why.

1604
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:56,506
Guys, thank you so much.
Philadelphia!

1605
01:17:56,631 --> 01:17:57,590
You guys were amazing!

1606
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,216
Thank you very much
for coming out!

1607
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,844
I really appreciate it!

1608
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:04,514
Thank you so much!
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

1609
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:08,351
Thank you, the married couple!
Dick photo people!

1610
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:11,312
Thank you very much!
Thank you!
